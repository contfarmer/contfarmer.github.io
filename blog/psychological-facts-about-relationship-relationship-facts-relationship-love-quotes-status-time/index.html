<p>Hi bro,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I m your new subscriber. Need your valuable advise for YouTube.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I come to know (according YouTube rules and regulations) that YouTube does not give eligibility for monitization to kind of channels, that make videos with &ldquo;no face, no voice&rdquo;. Is it really true?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is psych babble 101. Just saying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not arguing at all doesn‚Äôt necessarily represent a lack of interest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you‚Äôre in a relationship with someone who‚Äôs like a soulmate to you or even more then of course there won‚Äôt be arguments</p>

<p>I‚Äôll have to take exception of the comment about arguing in a relationship. I strived to inhibit arguments in my relationships because, in my opinion, arguments are a gateway for negativity to enter the relationship. It comes down to common sense, if I wasn‚Äôt interested in a woman I simply would remove myself from the relationship. Loss of interest in a relationship stems from monotony, mindless repetitions, and the worst one, routine. However, worse yet is the manufacturing of drama to test a mate‚Äôs responses. If you sniff that out as it‚Äôs being applied to you, infuriation will most likely follow. If you want a great relationship, treat your mate well and be grateful and gracious for being lucky enough to receive your mate‚Äôs affections.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs so truth, and also you don‚Äôt choose who you fall in love too,  younger we used to hangout a gangs and there was a girl that everybody‚Äôs was trying to get, and she was uses to this kinda of attention, and me and many of my friends we all had motorcycles, and she wanted to ride with him but he was going home and to came back she just assumed like that that she would get back with me, it‚Äôs just like that she put it, and I answered sorry but who the fuck are you to decided you were gonna rides with me on my bike, the face she had, and everybody‚Äôs else around who heard that, was priceless,  because she was very cute, so everybody‚Äôs look at me like I Was crazy, both of us we didn‚Äôt talk often except a hi, here and there‚Äôs, so for what ever reason a couples of months after this she just disappeared like this, so everybody‚Äôs thought she finally caught one she‚Äôd decided to keep, times when on and 7 years later after that, I cross her in a restaurant, she the one who recognized me, she say hi we talk a bit, but after a few I had to say sorry but I really don‚Äôt remember you , she had a nick name so she said that, didn‚Äôt ring any bells, and then it flashes me, and I was with one of my friend who was constantly after her before, so I told her go to the end see Fred is there, so she went, and for 2 weeks she was back ( kinda ) with us, so for 2 weeks he keep trying and trying to finally quit, a couples of days pass ,and she phone me, I didn‚Äôt understand anything because she didn‚Äôt had my number, and she told me she didn‚Äôt want me to be angry because she had ask a relative friend for my number, and she had to promesse him he would be in any troubles because she had a question about my bike, so I said ok fine , what is it, and you guess it , it had nothing to do with my bike,  we‚Äôve been together for 1 1/2 years so not that long , and I though the only reason she‚Äôd want anything to do with me, was the fact, that I probably was or is the only one who didn‚Äôt run after her, but once she had won her price and I was really hooked up well, she dumped without any real explanation except the phrase : your to good and nice for me, their isn‚Äôt any challenge. üëäPAF‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô. I wish she would had paid a bunch of dudes to beat me up instead, the worst heartbreak ever&hellip;.. I tough, but a few years after, I reconnected with a ex girlfriend of my buddy, and her and my girlfriend ( at the times) where good friends, and she then told me that when we were together she had cheated on me in one of thier girls nights in a club , and that she‚Äôd even showed her tits to everybody‚Äôs at the bar before, disappearing in the back so you know what, and it just brought everything back agains, just to fuck me up in the head, it wasn‚Äôt the first time I was cheated on in facts until proven different, I think I‚Äôve been cheated on in all the relationship I ever had, because to blow a dick for women is just a days to days basic, and any dicks a dick sizes and shaped changes but it‚Äôs all the same that‚Äôs were they controlled,  some will not belived but even if when younger I would have said that I would touch her unless having a titanium condom, it happend that she laughs at me , cheated on me, and so many more but it‚Äôs the girl I ever loved the most in my life, ( life is not funny, like we ear often, life‚Äôs is sarcastic) not even 1 month after she leaves me with many things , she even wanted to take my dog, that I‚Äôve had before being with her, and she was scared of him, and now she wants to took him from me ü§¨, anyway , I had √† infarctus ( hart attack) and not a fake one like they have often by the time my friends arrived at the hospital ( I tough it was, stomach burns ) I did died once there and they had to reanimated me with the booster cables and everything, and after seen 4 different doctors they all came up with the same reason for me having this, because I was only 38 never smoked never did drugs, not perfect a bit chubby but never to have a hart attacks, they all said , my life had suffered a dramatic stressed and , that I had to find a way to relaxed or it could happend again, the first time I heard it, my jaw fell to the floors??.?? , your telling me , I died because of a hart break, ( I‚Äôm the kinda dude that scares most pepoles)</p>

<p>This is true you don‚Äôt realize how much a person means until you‚Äôve lost  it is only then you realize their worth   Treat people with kindness and respect. Do not do unto anyone what you would not wish done to you Judge ye not unless ye be judged  Be Happy Happiness comes from within  follow what makes your heart sing Assume nothing until you heard it from the horses mouth Trust your instincts they will never let you down  what ever you give out you will recieve back ten fold</p>

<p>My girlfriend of 7 years broke up with me. we lived together and i raised her 3 daughters. we went through so many difficult life challenges but we always made it through. when our families turned on us, we relied on each other just to make it through the day. we were each others best friends. but, she always accused me of cheating and lying. i have never ever once cheated or lied. i tired telling her how can i, we are always together unless we are at work. other than that, every single day we were with each other. i know though that her accusing problems came from her baby daddy who would cheat on her and she would cheat on him, that went on for 10 years. then i came into the picture after they broke up. i tried my best every day to show her how much i love her, i just never thought her insecurities would get the best of us. i hope its true, &ldquo;you dont know how much you love someone until they are gone.&rdquo; from wut i found, shes seeing someone else now, 2 weeks after our break up. its about to be one month on Monday</p>

<p>I know there is too much water under the bridge to return to the way things used to be but I feel there is something holding him back from just being real with me on any level anymore.  He says it&rsquo;s from the way I react to things but my reactions are given no allowance or time or comfort from the pain that he initialized in the first place.  I literally feel like if this is the way he is going to be that I guess I never really knew him in the first place and was a true sucker with &ldquo;take me for a 4 year ride&rdquo; written in bold capital letters all-over my forehead.</p>

<p>Yes,  whn u hve a crush on somone u overlook there flaws was tht necessary in true love I dnt think we shuld evn tlk abt any flaws guyz. Sec thing yes,  I agree the mre u tlk abt ur crush to others tendency to be flling only fr him but in my case I hve decided in the end but first begining with lst till end. I&rsquo;mf I hve decided to keep somone in my heart thn only tht person &amp; others are there but nt tht place u knw wht I mean nt being g ruse other gutz I dnt want to break ur ‚ù§Ô∏ètoo so kind f adjustment. U knw gutz frm all f them one shuld be the fav onemost spcl guy right. My dream man&hellip;. Yeah so I agree whn I spk abt him tk others might kind f I&rsquo;m flling already fr him. But no mttr he lies to me as said abv guyz who hve there crush thy cnt lie in frnt f me especially other girls I Dnt knw but I catch in no moments tht hurts fr a while with lots f 10000f questions in mind why the he&rsquo;ll he lied to me may be bcz f mny reasons u see. Hve to convince ourselves whn it cmes chrcter f gud guyz u see. Anyway,  yeah I agree EVRYTHNG except whn u care fr somone thy constantly be with u nt shw off like others double stndrd u knw wht I mean be in somone else arm tlk abt her. Anyway,  aftr marriage love it happens tht u might fall fr eachither mny ppl does but again u shuld knw pure love &amp; list differences thn I guess u cn fll fr true love but nt in tht way. Yeah true love nvr dies. If somone likes u doesn&rsquo;t tke any effort to be in first priority no point if it doesn&rsquo;t wrk out thrugh other gutz stuff like tht I just feel tht girls shuld slammed those guy fces bcz thy love somone thy say thn thy gi there job as if thy dnt cre anymore I guess so much so he enjoys over there with other s<em><strong>womns fr hus cheap carrier to be built thn dnt expect frm her either tht She doesn&rsquo;t hve better choice thn u. If somone cares fr u truly surely thy would attempt to chnge themselves be presentable alwyz with lovngv&amp;kind person nt tht shw hus own intrest nvr think abt others at all selfish d</strong></em>üòÇüòÇüòúüòèüòèI hate mnz like this who handover evrythg to there s<em><strong>freinds a ct as if thy are the best f all f them were as thy aren&rsquo;t tobe proved nt evn one I guessüòäüòé. Ppl tlk a lot thy live somone were as thy dnt cnt evn proved one the thy stood by u alwyz no onelse was there. I want somebody in so mny hndsme r smart guyz in a grup only one cn hit f all u knw wht I mean bestest f all though he kept patience,  kindness,  love being fair enough with me &amp; other freinds too. I found him frm the day one who protected Me like true lover BF whtevr. Nw this us our choice&hellip;. Evryone has there own I guess right boyz I hope u agree to me too. So dnt love somone who suddenly aftr mny years be  half this side other side both sides u cnt sacrifice u cnt be calling a sacrifice like this in truelove. U surrender ur selves only fr tht person nt be acting up u see. Boyz see believe sme like wise girls need assurance proof tht u love her truly relse win her ‚ù§Ô∏èby hook r crook it depnds on guyz who are challenging thy love her so much were as thy dnt EVN prove single point f it. Yeah,  some onelse silently does this wins the heart f the Queen ‚ù§Ô∏èüòäüòúüòéu dnt loose tht person who constantly be with u all the time r chats r conversation with u. May be fr the double stndrd ppl I agree who speak only when there purpose thy want tobe fulfilled nthg else whn there us nooption thy cme to u see. No,  we&rsquo;re true lover r true love thy be with u fr Lifetime if thy trust,  respct u bcz u were the one fr eachither whn others were thinking r paying cmmnts on u whtevr thy feel like without knwing the Real truth these ppl whn thy hve a power to knw evrythg thy didn&rsquo;t picked up there asses at tht time too neither now thy kind f could won the ‚ù§Ô∏èf a simple girl bcz it&rsquo;s thr own selfish purpose nthgelse. Its real truth I&rsquo;m fyne with ut bcz thus whl wrld has been mean to eachither may be tht us why ppl are reaching to high landscape buildings &amp; there high dreams there houses but in humanity thy didn&rsquo;t evn crossed 1level tooüòÇüòÇüòèüòûsad reality. I cn appreciate others love fr me but noone cn free others to fll in love fr somone whm u spk finishd up again if thy cme up thn too I would like be there freinds nthg else.

So these are fke lovers,  fke Freind s</strong></em><em>kind f ppl I dropped them once again in frgive them but cnt trust the lines. V. NYC our imamssaying never trust the person who lied to u nvr lie to those who  trusted u. But in my case whm evr I trusted thy f</em><strong>turned to be the f</strong><em>devilish man. Ooh s</em><strong>guyz,  whm I had a crush fr the first time evn tht ass</strong><strong>tobe proved as a liar s</strong><em>guy. But noprblm I noticed one mre thing tht he loves me too so I just kept patient &amp; I knw he won&rsquo;t let me go nt evn as a true freinds frever r best freinds frever. Never leave a Truthfull beautiful humnbeing fr few purposes evryone goes thrugh problms but never evr do tht. Thy might nt proved all the time tht thy miss u a lot r EVN bith the sides but believe me thy do miss eachither who stood fr u no onelse cme in frnt üòçüòçüòçüò¢üòäüòéwhn everybody was thinking all the gutz whtevr offered me thy said either u leave cme but thy didn&rsquo;t wanted tobe lifetime at all tht us why thy left thn thy turned up with there bckstabbs still it&rsquo;s me who gve them honour to frgive them Mke thm as a freind as I said I cnt trust the person who lied to me after knwing me clearly,  aftr knwing my innocence he proved to be as nonsense fellow üòÇüòÇüòúanyway,  the ppl who told there freinds tht we are dumb today thy are been proved tobe clld as deaf &amp; dumb in my eyes I guessüòÇüòÇüòíüòèüíîüò¢evn tht time it hurted me thiugh he was acting he is the one thn why he was not long my NME in frnt f hus own present GF only dates he used to tlk wanted to get attention frm other s</em><strong>womns tht sme guy says he loves me but were he did he proved were as he proved his love fr those who didn&rsquo;t cared fr him &amp; thy used him like tissue üòíüòèüò†üòéno like these who says leaving us like diamond u went at the bck f ur own hus as (iron) but I guess leaving u was far better option in my eyes though u won&rsquo;t u derststnd u s</strong><em>gutz cn just opn ur f</em>**mouth frm there behind blme the innocnt girls like me. U cn yapping a lot frm behind like as ***bckstabbers but cnt prove tobe a gud humnbeing.

<p>&ldquo;When you have a crush on someone you overlook their flaws&rdquo;</p>
</li>

<p>Crushes are infatuation or lust and they have nothing to do with love because you can only love someone that you know.</p>

<p>You overlook your crush&rsquo;s flaws. Only when you are done is when you realize how many gaps there were!</p>
</li>

<p>Not arguing shows better communication skills, maturity and the make up sex is a not a good bandaid/ temporary fix afterward and so is the truce gift or apology for having a tantrum&hellip;&hellip;avoid it at all cost.
