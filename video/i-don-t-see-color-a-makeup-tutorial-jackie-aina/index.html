<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see color&rdquo; translates to &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see your problems and refuse to acknowledge them even when you mention them&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This makes me sad. The fact that Jackie has to continuously apologize for her words, asking us to &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t take it in this way.&rdquo; So many white people are given a free pass to speak their mind clearly without having to apologize for it, yet darker skinned folks are consistently told they will be punished for asking for basic human decency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Cops don’t ignore my skin color “&hellip;.sips tea in darkskiness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you can’t see color youre missing out on so much beauty!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i&rsquo;de rather have a foundation named &ldquo;i phone extension chord&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;medium ivory&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“ if you don’t see color, why y’all spend so much time at the tanning salon. What are you trying to achieve.” ILL WAIT 😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you Jackie.  This video is consciousness raising for me.  People might read this comment and say -why would this dude care?  Valid question and I&rsquo;ll tell you.  I have woman friends at work who talk about makeup.  It wasn&rsquo;t until a black woman explained to me the institutionalized racism in the cosmetics industry that I even had a clue.  And that is your point.  These companies (and not just them - society too) ignore black women and women of color and because it doesn&rsquo;t impact white people directly the subtle insidious discrimination goes unnoticed and unchecked.  Thanks to you, now I know a little more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see color&rdquo; consider saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see color as something that should determine a persons self worth.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“I don’t seeeee color “ is the most annoying statement ever and there to avoid any conversation about culture. If you don’t see color then you don’t see me and no we can’t be friends&hellip; just sayin. Thank you Jackie!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how does this have a whole 2k downvotes? y&rsquo;all are salty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having been in education, it drove me nuts to see teachers say that they don&rsquo;t see color in their students. UM, EXCUSE ME. As a teacher, you should absolutely see and recognize color, recognizing the privileges and struggles that someone may experience one way or another. Thanks for being so vocal about this!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Why is it that you get to ignore something I don&rsquo;t get to ignore?&rdquo; Love it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;but why cant we all just get along&rdquo; -fellow white people</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>lmao because you made this an issue when you said you dont see color</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The police don&rsquo;t ignore my skin color so what makes you think!?&hellip;&hellip;I love jackie lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Eggshell, cream &amp; iPhone extension cord” 😂😂😂😂 I’M OUT!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who say they don’t see color are kinda like people who say you’re not suicidal to someone who just said they’re suicidal. It’s a quick, easy way to STOP the conversation because they are uncomfortable.  Sometimes they don’t know what to say, but instead of putting some effort in and starting a discussion they shut it down. It has to be talked about before people will change and healing will take place. Thanks for helping me see color.</p>

<p>literally just subscribed because of how amazing this was!! so much respect!!

<p>I love you, Jackie!  You have such a perfect blend of comedic timing and really powerful statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m watching this without headphones next to my white roommate 💀 I hope she’s uncomfortable hearing this scorching tea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The cops don&rsquo;t ignore my skin color&rdquo; PREACH!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh she talking about jeffree. He definitely threw kylies lip gloss in the trash smh&hellip;.then here comes Kim defending him a year later. smh. Thank you for this video.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Naaaaaaaaa when you hit the folk tho I hollered! But On a serious note this video was nothing but facts🗣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will not buy a brand of makeup unless my girl Jackie says it&rsquo;s truly inclusive of all races. Pledge. ✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Race needs to be talked about!!!! We can&rsquo;t just erase a system and pretend to be &ldquo;color blind&rdquo; when we have built a system on enslaving a race. Race is a social construct, and we have to admit that white privilege exists. I am a white female and I will call out racism because that&rsquo;s how it should be</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“I don’t see color.” comes off to me as “I’m uncomfortable talking about race” which doesn’t help anybody.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People that are getting mad about black people talking about the struggles that they are forced to face daily needs to understand that the world wont change if no one open their mouth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it just me but is this look actually cute but youre low key giving me Rafikki from the linon king with the red nose to brow contour. Love ya though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i love that you use your platform to speak about important things. i am so sick of the silent beauty blogger that is unaware of the world around them. you&rsquo;re doing good in this world, Jackie ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I just say how much I LOVE THIS VIDEO?! I&rsquo;m Mixed Race. My mom (who is Indo-Carribean) is a beautiful brown and my Dad (who is Dutch-American) is a Creamy white. I am Olive/Tan complected (sidenote: Jackie girl, I feel you on the whole getting pale in the winter thing.) For people who grow up in a mixed race household, &lsquo;seeing&rsquo; color is not a bad thing. Color is a daily part of our life. Having parents with two different colors, is and was my normal. Its only when you step into the world, do you realize your normal is not everyone else&rsquo;s normal. Like, when People make a surprised face when I tell them who my dad is. When I have to loudly say &ldquo;Dad&rdquo;, whenever we go to restaurants and grocery stores without my mom, so people know I&rsquo;m his daughter and not his 20 something girlfriend. The fact that I&rsquo;ve had to explain my ethnic background to every person I meet since I was 5. And yet&hellip;I love my skin color. I love being apart of two cultures. I love that I have my dad&rsquo;s eyes and my Mom&rsquo;s coloring. I love my both sides of my extended family, who constantly told me, how beautiful me and my skin were. I grew up with people who were European, Asian, Pacific Islander, Black, Latinx and I got to experience their food and cultures. I grew up with two Amazing Parents who constantly supported and loved me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jackie needs a day time talk show ASAP 👏 wendy williams who?!? 👏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1K thumbsdown, like wow.  She is a Black makeup Guru who is all there for getting more color options for black people.  She gives credit where it is due and throws shade where it is due.  She speaks her mind and speaks up for most of us other people of color because she has the platform and can reach levels most of us can&rsquo;t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The thing is that you can&rsquo;t just pretend that everybody looks the same and that race shouldn&rsquo;t be relevant; there&rsquo;s no erasing thousands of years worth of history just because you don&rsquo;t want to deal with social implications. People who say that they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t see color&rdquo; are almost always the non-POCs anyway, and it&rsquo;s a strange excuse for them to get away with psuedo-racist things by pulling the excuse of, &ldquo;Oh, well I didn&rsquo;t /mean/ to be racist, therefore it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When anyone, including Marc Jacobs, says they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t see color&rdquo; it&rsquo;s just a narcissistic ploy to shift blame onto you. Rather than take responsibility for screwing up he just tries to say it&rsquo;s out problem and not his. I think you were very diplomatic about it, but I&rsquo;m never buying anything he makes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“iPhone extension cord” 💀💀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People don’t “see” color until Hollywood casts a POC as they favorite comic book characters. People don’t “see” color until POC tell them not to wear their culture as a costume,l. 🙄✌🏽</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a white woman, I DEFINITELY agree with you on the &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see color&rdquo; thing. I think it&rsquo;s ridiculous, why wouldn&rsquo;t you want to see all the colors of all the different people? It&rsquo;s a beautiful world and our differences should be celebrated. Also, one of my professors in college a few years ago talked about skin color a lot (he is black) and we spoke SO much about how race is just a manmade concept  created to separate and segregate. The only difference between you and I is the amount of melanin in our skin, if somebody were just shown our skeletons they would have no clue that one of us was white and the other black. I love that you talk about all of this, it shouldn&rsquo;t be something that makes others uncomfortable, it&rsquo;s straightforward and it reflects what&rsquo;s going on in the world right now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m obviously the shade of a marshmallow lol, but I mean&hellip;..I can see! I can&rsquo;t even fathom why and how ANY cosmetic company can just NOT consider AALLLL skin colors! Sure, we all watch more muas that relate to us, and yes of course I do! I will watch muas that help me find products that suite my skin tone, but I also LOVE watching  ALL and ANYONE that have makeup talent bc no matter WTH color skin anyone has, I get inspiration from them all! I mean, it&rsquo;s not 19^FRKIN^50!!! It is MIND BLOWING!!! And nope&hellip;.I&rsquo;m not dark skinned&hellip;.but I also dc if anyone thinks I have no say so about this subject, bc oh, yes I do and I can!!! Like wth ppl&hellip;.look around you&hellip;..tell me, when your in public, does everyone have light skin? HELL know!! I mean, our president is even orange! Lol&hellip;.i just had to give a Lil giggle lol! Alright&hellip;.I&rsquo;m done, and i apologize for my rant, but it is a huge deal!

<p>I have been a subbie for a WHILE now (since PumpkinPie05 days). I have to say I have ALWAYS enjoyed you. But, I really must say, sis? Your voice for our cause has been an amazing transition and privilege to watch. I see you, I acknowledge you, and I am praying for you. God Bless you baybay - and thank you. BTW&hellip; The You had me ROLLLING - &ldquo;DON&rsquo;T WORRY - I&rsquo;LL WAIT!!&rdquo; - I am waiting too oooo!! May God ALMIGHTY continue to bless your Hustle curlfriend. Love YOU! MWAHZ!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I heard someone say that privilege is the ability to be ambivalent about the issues that don&rsquo;t affect you, and I really think that&rsquo;s true. I love that you speak about your experiences as a dark skinned black woman, as it&rsquo;s literally the exact opposite of my own, because I&rsquo;m super pale. it&rsquo;s opened my eyes about a lot of things, and made me realize and see the hypocrisy and pandering in the makeup industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>47yr old white woman here. Just asking where one finds those race cards. My husband (black) of 26yrs apparently didn&rsquo;t get one when he was born. Yet he&rsquo;s still accused of having one and using it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I see color, I see the injustices, maybe it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s happening to those I love. To not see it is to ignore my child, my husband and the beautiful family I married into.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s so nice to have somebody to give reviews that isn&rsquo;t Caucasian. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love Nikki, Patrikk, Christen Dominique&hellip; but they don&rsquo;t help me find what&rsquo;s great for my skin tone. In Makeup, you have to see color. In this world you have to see color. That does not make you racist though. That just makes you less ignore to today&rsquo;s prob, love this vid btw. Great convo Jackie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see color=I don&rsquo;t see racism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about not seeing color, it&rsquo;s about recognizing those colors, respecting them because actually NOT ALL PEOPLE ARE THE SAME. They are not and we should celebrate that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;the cops don&rsquo;t ignore my skin, so why should you&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>d a m n</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Truth and personality &hellip;. who can be mad at that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel so grateful for your channel because you made it a POINT to talk about colour and use your platform to broadcast the problems I felt like no one was noticing or everyone was just plain&hellip; ignoring. Mama Jackie&rsquo;s coming with the tea that brewed for CENTURIES of prejudice against people of colour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THEY MIGHT NOT SEE COLOR BUT THEY DAMN SURE SEE SHADES. there’s no excuse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gurrrrrrrrl this is why I love you &hellip;..now fast forward to July 1 2018. You have added to the conversation and has help bring more shades to btw, You go gurl!!! Gurl toot your horn!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you Jackie, it’s shocking that this still needs to be said in the 21st century&hellip;continue educating!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s 2018. We’re not letting anyone shut us up about racial issues 🤷🏾‍♀️. Thanks for the lesson Jackie. Stay woke y’all 😌</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This video damn near brings me to tears Jackie I just have to say I love you I support you I appreciate you I need you to know how much the beauty industry needs you to continue doing the real work that you are doing you are amazing and incredible thank you for continue to push forwards regardless</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Focused.” Focused of telling the truth. It honestly pisses my of that foundation/concealers are typically catered toward the “perfect” bronzed skin tone. I can never find a shade light enough for my skin tone but can make it work because concealer. But anyone darker than a toasted bagel has very limited options which is complete bullshit. Options for dark skin tones shouldn’t be an after thought. If a company can come up with that many “different” shades for light skin tones then they can do the same for the dark ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg this made me laugh so harddddd I love how she addressed these comments by making this video omg😂❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love this I see color all the time and I&rsquo;m not just talking about skin I&rsquo;m talking about my environment which I see many different shades and even in skin I see many different shades lights darks mediums and its all beautiful I think we should appreciate what makes us different cause even tho we&rsquo;re all human beings we are all made different to shine in our own way I love the videos u make Jackie 😍❤️💯

<p>WoW sis really hit the folks 😱😱😱</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is everything I’ve ever wanted in my life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wanna know how bad it is buying foundation for WOC? I&rsquo;m mixed and &ldquo;light skinned&rdquo; and sometimes my complection is the darkest shade makeup companies make so I can only imagine the struggle for darker skinned women. This NEEDS to be talked about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does Jackie still look good🤣😂</p>
</li>

<p>Ok. This video is amazing. I’m sitting here, watching this video, and I’m amazed. I’m a white girl, but these racial issues bother me as much as they bother POC. Makeup is meant for E V E R Y O N E. White, black, mixed, Asian, Mexican, etc. I absolutely hate that white is the “normal”. As a white person, this bothers me because people shouldn’t be seen as the color of their skin, they should be seen as who they are. If you want to wear makeup, DO IT! These makeup companies need to get their heads out of the clouds and open their eyes. We aren’t in a 1930’s film, we can see color. So, we should know by now that people of all colors should be able to walk into an Ulta or Sephora without having to worry about a makeup company not having their shade. That’s all I had to say. Major respect for you, Jackie. 💚</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I dont see color&rdquo; means &ldquo;I have to pretend you&rsquo;re not black to respect you.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though I’m light skin, it makes me mad when makeup companies don’t expand their foundation colors. Working at Sephora and constantly seeing brands launching tons of lighter shades and one to three darker shades literally makes me so mad. It’s not right. I don’t see why it’s so hard, you can easily give lighter shades but give up on darker ones?? Makes no sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IM LIVING FOR THE SHADE!!! 🌴🌴🌴</p>

<p>Love this!!  In my country, Trinidad, we have a saying, &ldquo;Yuh not puttin&rsquo; water in yuh mouth to say de ting&rdquo; meaning you are speaking it as truthfully as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a person says they don&rsquo;t see color it should mean the color of your skin wont change me seeing you as my equal.  In the world of beauty however, if ppl like you don&rsquo;t change or flip the script esp on topics as this, ain&rsquo;t not a damn thing gonna change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I admire you a lot for having the guts to be sincere and talk about things that are important.</p>
</li>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got eggshell. You&rsquo;ve got cream. You have iPhone extension cord.&rdquo; AUNTIE I CHOKED!!</p>

<p>When I discovered the YouTube beauty community, I subscribed to people that looked like me because I wanted to find products for me. I discovered you last year and now you’re literally all I watch on YouTube. Your reviews set an example every blogger should follow: just. keep. it. real. If people just wanted to buy anything, then they’d just walk into a store. If we come on YouTube, it’s because we’re looking for honest opinions from real people. Jackie, please never stop using your voice in the name of equality 💛💛💛</p>

<li>
<p>Jackie&rsquo;s final look is giving me rafiki from the lion king vibes😂😂 LOVE YOU GIRL! 👌</p>

<p>Beauty brands scared of you. They should! U speak for all of us. Thankyou</p>

<li>
<p>OMG &ldquo;Iphone extension cord!!&rdquo; Made me laugh so loud</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sometimes i remember trevor noah asking &ldquo;if you cant see colour then what do you do at a stop light?&rdquo; and i ascend into a different plane of existence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Você é maravilhosa! Obrigada por esse vídeo incrível &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I honestly don’t think it’s humanly possible to express my love and appreciation for Jackie. If it weren’t for her, my love for makeup probably wouldn’t be what it is today. Thank you Jackie for making always making me and other black women feel like there is a place for us🧡🧡</p>
</li>

<p>&ldquo;The Cops don&rsquo;t ignore my skin colour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is amazing. Love from Manila 🇵🇭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I SCREAMED WHEN I HEARD “iphone extension cord” LOL SUCH A QUEEN ❤️❤️❤️😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The cops don&rsquo;t ignore my skin color.&rdquo; GO OFF, JACKIE, YES! Honestly though, thank you so much for including that part about circumstantial ignorance. I went through all the stages of &ldquo;Racism is dead, I don&rsquo;t see color&rdquo; bullshit. But to be honest, it&rsquo;s because I grew up in a bit of a bubble. It took several years of arguing with my POC friends that I made outside of that bubble to realize that I was privileged and because I hadn&rsquo;t had experience with racism, that meant that I had no right to argue with someone that did. So, I never assume that I know more than people who actually have to deal with judgement and discrimination. Number 1 rule when talking about race is to listen. Thank you for this video, it&rsquo;s so important.

</li>
<li>
<p>I paused and laughed so hard when you revealed the makeup look. Lmaoo. On some real stuff I respect your opinion and I&rsquo;m light skinned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wasn’t ready 😂😂</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>But for real though, this was well said and needed</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>love u for who u are and speaking ur mind!</p>
</li>

<p>xx</p>
</li>

<p>I had a professor in college once say that not seeing color is a white privilege. She said that people of color are constantly being reminded of their color by the way people treat them and the way society treats them so only white people have the privilege to “not see color” and to not be affected by race.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m mixed white Hispanic, white, Asian, and native american. My skin color changes all the damn time! I can&rsquo;t find a foundation to fit my skin ever. Because Its always to white/red or too dark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OH MY GOOODDDD “Never felt that emotion” OH MY GOOODDDD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Girl! You scared me the whole time you were putting that makeup on! I was like, &ldquo;This is not gone be pretty when you put the color back on😁&rdquo; The black and white said it. But they have to get the point from now on. Good job Jackie!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gosh I love her, her talking about her color and race is so amazing she is an amazing person and I’m so glad she makes it clear to people who judge or doesn’t except</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this tea is delishis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this what makeup would be like in The Giver🤔🤔</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>You are still my favorite, hands down, continue to drop that satire, they just don’t get it. Probably never will</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jackie!!! If I didn’t already love you before, I love you now! Thank you for using your platform to be a voice for women of color. 💕💕💕💕</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I LOST IT AT IPHONE EXTENSION CORD 😂😂😂💀💀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OMG! you are such an inspiration! and I love the fact that you can talk about race with humour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ve literally just been watching all of your videos, one after another, for weeks 😂😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obsessed with you &amp; just want to spend an afternoon getting drinks and girl talk! You’re freakin hilarious I CANNOT. Lady. What the hell. Teach me your ways. I LIVE I DIE I ADORE YOU! 😭💁🏼‍♀️❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jackie this has to be one of the best vids on YT right now. I will always love how you don&rsquo;t give up and stand for what you believe in. You&rsquo;re a wonderful woman and great example</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YASSSSSSS!! Loveeee how you spoke about this with such grace. I’ve been seeing manyyyy other youtubers begin to speak about this when before no one did so it’s amazing the influence you have. You should be very proud of yourself for your work! I also really loved how you incorporated your look i to this. Brilliant! I hateeeee when ppl say I don’t see color omg! Also since clearly none of these companies care about the morals and inclusiveness  of having a decent shade range to talk in a language they do seem to speak ($$$) it’s just straight up stupid economically&hellip; why would you not give yourself the opportunity to make more money?! And now they just shut me out bc if my friend can’t find a shade for herself if we go shopping together why would I shop there myself??-_- I also wonder where these ppl are from seriously. Maybe I’m lucky to have been raised where I was but how can you just think that your shade is the only one that exists?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not see colour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or gender</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or age</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or anything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;You got Iphone extension cord&hellip;&rdquo; XD I died!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;you know what honey, I don&rsquo;t care what shade you give me, I don&rsquo;t see color&rdquo; 😂🤣 I love you Jackie. I think doing the video in Black and White was very powerful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched this video about 3-4 times. I absolutely love you, Jackie!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I just realized that you posted it on my birthday. Yassssssss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEE jackie with the TRUTH. girl I just LOVE IT!! I&rsquo;ve been binge  watching your videos all day long 😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I literally love you and your channel! I love how you always speak the truth!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had to pause the video cause I was dying at ‘iPhone extension cord’ 😂😂😂😂

<p>I&rsquo;m so here for this video! Thank you for bringing this up! and for also including other women of color, Native women especially. Yakoke! You are so amazing and I LOVE your videos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you, my white daughter looks obviously different from my black daughter and the stares my husband and I get prove the &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see color&rdquo; team doesn&rsquo;t really mean what they say. They are different and there is nothing wrong with that. I have to &ldquo;see color&rdquo; because I have to raise one daughter to understand that there will be prejudices that will come against her, and teach the other about not being silent over the injustices her sister will see. Not &ldquo;seeing color&rdquo; dismisses my black daughter&rsquo;s culture, her ancestry, her ethnicity&rsquo;s accomplishments over adversities, and her very being. That phrase needs to stop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for always speaking up for women that look like me. It’s amazing to see people use their platforms for good no matter back lash may come from it. I love you Aunite Jackie! 😍😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I simply adore you. Seeing you makes me feel good as a dark skinned woman! Thanks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phenomenal woman, phenomenally❤️ I appreciate and thank Jackie so much for being an advocate for us black girls❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“ I’m just asking, JANICE” I’m weakkkk 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holy shit I love this video!! I’m a “basic white girl” myself - and I actually HAVE said something along the lines of “I don’t see color”, thinking it was something good to say. Because I thought yo, everyone is equal. So why would I talk about skin color if it doesn’t make me treat you differently? However, I think (and I hope) I have educated myself a little bit. I now know that it’s about being valued, regardless of the color of your skin and also, the ability of being proud of the color of your skin! And I understand that if you say “I don’t see color”, you take a whole part of an identity away. Thanks Jackie-o for this friggin’ fun and useful lecture! You rock gurl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YES JACKIE!!! Love everything about you and what you stand for!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think you’re amazing. I don’t know what it feels like to be you, but I will never try to invalidate what you experience. I watch you because I value your experience and perspective. And you are gorgeous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love this vid :) The tanning statement has nothing to do with race but I can see how people would think that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for being you and being such a good voice &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the past, I have used the &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see color&rdquo; line as a way to say that I personally won&rsquo;t treat anyone different based on their ethnicity or race. I found this video very educational to me . I learned that sometimes even saying something meant with good intentions can still come off as rude, disrespectful and ignorant. Thank you Jackie for opening my eyes to my unintentional ignorance toward racial inequality!! Makeup companies need to get their shit together. I will also start subscribing to more beauty gurus who are of a different race or ethnicity than myself so I can show my support for fighting racial inequality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lmfaoooo I knew something was wrong when u had it in grayscale was just waiting to see the crazy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;People tend to be more pale in the winter.&rdquo; 😂😂😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your comment about not having experience with diversity, especially in small towns, really just resonated with me. growing up in a small wyoming town doesn’t really allow for many interactions with people of color. when my mom was growing up, there were absolutely zero black kids in her high school. in fact, there were zero black people in the entire town. even now, local stores do not carry ANY complexion products for anyone darker than a sheet of paper. the existence of people of color is ignored and often they are alienated. in my school, there were people making explicitly racist comments and they were never even told what they were saying was wrong. i think you brought up a lot of good points and i’m glad that there are people like you out here who are fighting for this because it is a worthwhile fight. keep up the amazing work!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I died laughing just looking at the thumbnail😂😂😂😂. Everyone sees color, let&rsquo;s be real.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop it Jackie you&rsquo;re making too much sense. The selective outrage crowd is going to be offended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this was such an amazinggggg idea! keep bringing what only you can  bring to the table!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is spot on!  Love Love Love you 😍. Keep doin what your doin, your gonna make great changes in this world 🌎

<p>love, Love, LOVEEEE this video. Nigerians are just naturally smart , Ya feel me ? 🤟🏾</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phenomenal video. Very well thought out. Yup miss Jackie. 👏🏻</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a white person, I have to admit that I used to be one of those people that said that I don&rsquo;t see color.  My thought process was that well, we&rsquo;re all equal, so skin color shouldn&rsquo;t matter!  It wasn&rsquo;t until college that I took a class on race in america that I realized how wrong I was.  While I had the best intentions, I was blind to what others went/go through.  Saying that I didn&rsquo;t see color denied and ignored others&rsquo; feelings about what they have gone through.  It&rsquo;s also terrible that it took me until college until realize this.  I really like what Jackie does.  Talking about race makes people uncomfortable, and at times makes me feel uncomfortable as well.  But people need to be uncomfortable about this and need to be shown that there are differences because of the color of our skin.  There shouldn&rsquo;t be, we should all be treated as equal, but the fact of the matter is that we&rsquo;re not treated equal.  Jackie is doing a great job continuing to educate and call out people/companies.  No change was ever made comfortably.  Keep up the good work, Jackie!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love this!! Everything you said is spot on. And when you mentioned Native Women I got a little teary. I am Native and have had good and bad experiences with people of different colors saying they thought we were all dead. I love you Jackie and I&rsquo;m so glad I found your channel ❤️</p>

<p>I love how jackie approaches any theme with ease and while staying calm and joking. I would be hella sick if I had to read dumb comments all the time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I see color, and it&rsquo;s a beautiful world. Love your sense of humor!</p>

<p>This is my umpteenth time watching this video, Ms Aina. This was true hundreds of years ago to today and, unfortunately, will continue to be on point in the foreseeable future. Thanks for your work, for being unafraid and for using your platform in this way. Signed, a 60 something black woman in the struggle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is why you are my favorite aunty! 🙌🏽</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love what you said about not being seen. As a Native American / White woman who goes through watching people forget my Native American culture and my peoples history is so depressing. People think we are an extinct race or something. Most people don’t understand the oppression so many people and races and cultures go through all the time. And it is important to have these conversations.❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how white people created the concept of not seeing color to treat us like human beings, but in the same breath fail to listen to us when we say we don&rsquo;t like it and how it dehumanizes blackness.This is why I can&rsquo;t take most of these white &ldquo;allies&rdquo; seriously. Half of them are busy trying to tell us how we should feel rather than listening to how we actually feel. Why keep trying to say you don&rsquo;t see color a way to fix racism when the victims of racism keep telling you that this conecpt actually aids racism by keeping you blind to your own prejudice against us.</p>
</li>

<p>Wow, this video &lt;3 Thanx you to ch: &lsquo;Say It Loud&rsquo; for the link!!! And Jackie, of course, for being you and making this video!!!~</p>

<p>By the way, in my opinion, the Internet has eliminated the &ldquo;I live in a small town, I didn&rsquo;t grow up around Black People, I wasn&rsquo;t born her&hellip;&rdquo; excuse. No matter where you&rsquo;re from, YOU KNOW. The internet has made this a very, very, small world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m old and &ldquo;iPhone cord&rdquo; white and love you to pieces! Keep going, you make the world a better place just being you. XOXO

<p>Yooooo! I love Jackie Aina. She&rsquo;s so salty tho lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was the best video I&rsquo;ve seen. I legit laughed out loud ar 12 in the morning when you turned the color back on LOL. Thank you so much for doing what you do Jackie. Been a fan and supporter for YEARS!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love this! I appreciate you making content like this so much! We need more racial conversations! We&rsquo;ve come far as a society and have less (not by any means nonexistent but less) aggressive, overt racism but now the black community often faces cultural and racial erasure. I often feel ignored or not included and it&rsquo;s always so underhanded and indirect so I wonder &ldquo;is this racism? Do they not like me? Am I too shy?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s confusing! But conversations like these are much needed! Thank you from a fellow black makeup enthusiast!</p>

<p>Rip. I&rsquo;m typing from heaven bcuz I died laughing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for always advocating for real change in the beauty industry and encouraging discussion! You&rsquo;re a legend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still slayed this look tho&hellip;👀👅</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This video will forever be my fav video 🖤 that makeup look gets me every time! 😂 and the message is so real 🖤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one of the reasons why you&rsquo;re one of my favorite beauty gurus/any youtuber is because you talk about whatever the hell you want because it&rsquo;s YOUR channel. please never stop talking about race and the brands who&rsquo;s shades don&rsquo;t cater to people of color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>also maybe i&rsquo;m the only one who hears this but most of the time when i hear people say &ldquo;i don&rsquo;t see color&rdquo; it&rsquo;s because they just said something before that is or could be controversial, so they&rsquo;re trying to make a disclaimer/cover their tracks. or they say &ldquo;i don&rsquo;t see color&rdquo; when asked bout something involving race.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m a white girl in Flint, Michigan and it is a dominantly black city. Do you think we would have poison water if the city was 90% white, middle class families? No. I see race every day and it matters because people are treated differently. I love your message, keep speaking out ❤❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That makeup was a excellent point made!!! And furthermore I&rsquo;m happy to see color. I&rsquo;m one of the forgotten in the color spectrum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YASSS GIRL TEACH &lsquo;EM!!! i love your channel and your life perspective 😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🙌🙌🙌 👏👏👏</p>

<p>“iPhone extension cord” lmfao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Between this and your Shape Tape Foundation vid, YOU ARE PURE PERFECTION!! I am so here for this and for you!!! 💖💖💖😍😍😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I absolutely LOVE you and your channel for your artistry, passion, and awareness. You open my eyes and never stop creating a conversation about the lack of representation in makeup products. Since I was a teenager I always found it whack how brands would have like 16 shades of light-medium and 3 for dark complexions. I&rsquo;m so glad someone as strong as you has a platform to discuss these issues and actually be willing to make a change  to the point where brands look to you for help and confirmation. I love love love love LOVE u and keep giving me that tea. Thank you for making me aware. &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should have used Tarte&rsquo;s foundation for this look since they don&rsquo;t seem to see color 😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great video Jackie, YOU CAME INTO SOMEBODY HOUSE TODAY ! Thanks for sharing as always and being true to yourself and not adjusting your content to a box that the beauty community may try to put you in. You are talented in many ways and I have been watching your channel for some time and even if I don&rsquo;t try the makeup looks, it is always nice to come back to see you speak on what you feel needs to be said.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for educating everyone, I’m not black but your videos really made me understand how bad the beauty community is and how non inclusive these brands are Tysm xx</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HILARIOUS!! Get em Jackie!!! The iPhone extension cord though 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣</p>
