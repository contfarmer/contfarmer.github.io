<p>Plot twist: Scott hasn’t been releasing FNaF games for his fans. He’s been doing it to slowly drive Matpat insane and into the world of convoluted puzzles and storylines so that, when he steps back, he has an heir to his throne.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I still feel like Scott didn’t even have a lore prepared he’s just following behind matpat confirming random things</p>

<p>how this thing with FNAF is going for years:</p>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>we solved this!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>we know more!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>we were wrong!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>six years and we’re still getting fresh fnaf content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scott and Matpat is like having a chess match that never ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matt:&ldquo;Fnaf it&rsquo;s coming to an end&hellip;..&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scott: HHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA funniest joke I&rsquo;ve ever heard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s no possible way that Scott just so happened to drop the trailer RIGHT after Matt said he might not have to do another fnaf theory again for a while</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Game Theory next month: &ldquo;We were WRONG!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I pray whoever likes this comment becomes a billionaire someday</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matpad: solves fnaf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Five Nights At Freddy&rsquo;s - Security Breach: &ldquo;oh poor Guy&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matt pat: I solved fnaf!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scott: “there is another&hellip;”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ok but hear me out: so Cassidy was the very first victim that got killed: back in the fnaf 4 minigame he was the one stuffed in the suit. And then the crying child got bit and also possessed Golden Freddy. And then they were moved to the other location in 1985, where 5 kids got killed and also where Charlotte possessed the puppet. If you remember the minigame give gifts give life the fifth kid in the middle was put into Golden Freddy. That kid couldn’t have been Cassidy or the crying child because they were dead in another location, it wouldn’t make sense for their dead bodies to be moved to the 1985 location. So logically we can conclude that fifth kid is the one that possessed Golden Freddy after both Cassidy and the crying child possessed it. That’s just a theory though, correct me if it’s wrong.</p>

<p>This episode “we solved Golden Freddy”</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>I just realised that Cassidy probably killed the crying child purposely as a part of her revenge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I still wonder how Matt feels about the fanfic Scott made&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scott looking at this like “you fool, I have 70 alternate games”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Game theory: “We Solved-“</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: “don’t do that, don’t give me hope”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He tried to protec</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But he had to attac</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But in the end&hellip;he always comes bac.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MattPat, this is the 7th time you’ve shown golden Freddy in class</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fnaf Theorist: Welp boys, We finally did it&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine his son growing up, eventually finding MatPat&rsquo;s Youtube channel, and realizing what he&rsquo;s been doing all the time. that&rsquo;s gonna be something else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Game theory: We finally solved golden Freddy!!</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Scott: turns on pc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hey, &ldquo;how to dry your hands using a single paper towel&rdquo; was life changing dude.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So uh we&rsquo;re just not gonna talk about the Deviantart mpreg fanfiction that was In The Flesh huh?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scott: writes a matpat x springtrap mpreg 300k word hurt/comfort angst fanfic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matpat: um chile anyways so-</p>

<p>“We solved Golden Freddy”</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>wait I thought you solved him 5 years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6 years ago MatPat: &quot; its just a theory &quot;  Scott :&rdquo; its time to make this mans career &quot; MatPat I just hope you see this thank you I have been watching these for so long and it makes me happy knowing we are slowly getting closer to the end of fnaf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scott Cawthon accidentally made an SCP and I’m accepting it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Cassidy was an impostor.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;1 impostor remains.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Game theory is going to get really mad when he finds out four days later they published the teaser trailer for security breach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait wait wait, Afton is literally being tormented in a hospital bed, living a waking nightmare before eventually passing on&hellip; Crying Child vibes anyone? If CC is the spirit that possess Golden Freddy it makes sense that he&rsquo;d wanna do this to Afton, to remind him how he was treated after the Chomp of 83.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meanwhile in golden freddy&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cassidy and Kelsey * screaming *</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chris * crying *</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Possible other children * talking *</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this has got to be the 5th time he “solved” golden freddy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I still wonder how Matt feels about the fanfic Scott made&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This whole entire time when I was introduced to Eneard,I thought of a non-animatronic way of Two animatronics becoming one,called Fusion.Fusion was a thing That was created in a show called “Steven universe”. Fusion was a thing where two people could dance to become one,And now The way to figure out the mystery of golden Freddy was to Put two souls into one suit, and in my eyes that’s fusion to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The year is 2500, Matthew Patrick VII has discovered a real life FazBear’s pizza and is playing out the events of the original game&hellip;except he is the man behind the slaughter.

<li>
<p>Are we just gonna ignore the fact there&rsquo;s like an mpreg in the book</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the human character is named Matt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And it&rsquo;s with a springtrap</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scott and Matpat are just in a perpetual game of uno with infinite reverse cards&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently preparing my headache meds and a notebook for when matpat reviews the security breach trailer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poor Mat! Just another 13 theories about William then you’ll be perfectly fine  and will have him completely figured out along with Mike and the crying child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MatPat: &ldquo;SOLVED!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scott Cawthon: &ldquo;How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man?!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No matter what, William is always gonna be one of my favourite characters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want Scott’s will to include all of the lore to be given to mat pat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did I scream in happiness when mike wasn’t the crying child</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BWAHAHAHA sorry I just imagined the nurses pulling out a Ouija board and being like: “DIE” and then the triangle just going: “No” 😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always two there are, a Master and an Apprentice.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Oh wait, this isn&rsquo;t a Star Wars Theory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So just thinking about the whole “there could be more souls inside Golden Freddy(and the Stitchwraith)”; going back on to Candy Cadet’s stories, five things combined into one(though I’m sure you’ve already thought of this and is gonna be talked about in the next video)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Little did poor MatPat know, this was only the beginning” - Probably  Scott Cawthon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first child is more in control because when he was killed his agony turned to anger which is why he is more in control than the other child who can’t move or see outside</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s hard to believe the fact that this all started with “The purple guy killed 5 kids and stuffed them into animatronics and now they’re possessed”.

<li>
<p>Matpat: <em>releases theory</em></p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Scott Cawthon: <em>writing down</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Game theory:&lsquo;FNAF is finally end&rsquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FNAF9:&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think so&rsquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now Scott is gonna pull another uno reverse card with the new game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matpat can pull you into a story  and you just can’t stop watching it’s crazy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, a symbolism of the Bite of 83’ could be that the Stitchwraith didn’t want to hurt people; just to scare them. Either giving them a little shock, or&hellip; throwing them in Fredbear’s mouth?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better late then never I suppose</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>scott&rsquo;s will is going to be the entire fnaf lore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just binged watched all of the fnaf theories and this episode reminded me when Matpat dismissed his finding of the 6 letter word &ldquo;GLFIUS&rdquo;. Golden Freddy is us!!! Just thought it was interesting that maybe you could have solved Golden Freddy a while ago. Not judging just making a statement. Love the series though. Can&rsquo;t wait to see more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stand User: Golden Freddy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stand name: Scott&rsquo;s trolling power</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the fnaf mpreg:👁👄👁</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matpat: There won&rsquo;t be many more fnaf theories for now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secuirty Breach Trailer: That&rsquo;s where your wrong pal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shows us a creepy intro then says Hello welcome to film theory he didn’t realize but in my eyes he made a jump scare atleast to me</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Scott:NO</p>

<li>
<p>I’m convinced Scott doesn’t even know the fnaf lore himself and is hoping you’ll make sense of it all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I came here after I stopped watching this 3 years ago</p>

<p>But most importantly&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just wanted to add to this that Andrew, or whoever is attached to Afton in the book, is wearing an alligator mask and in the happiest day mini game from fnaf 4 there are all the children wearing different masks so the green mask could also be an alligator and not Happy Frog. There is also an alligator in the trailer for security breach so it could be connected to that as well. I thought that was interesting. Thanks for listening.</p>

<p>Scott: imma start this man&rsquo;s whole career..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>G r e g o r y .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was preparing for a jump scare in the intro, turns out matpat’s sudden loud “HELLO INTERNET, WELCOME TO GAME THEORY” was the thing that scared me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So now we have to explain the alligator mask. Also, the story might evolve to some animatronic&rsquo;s having more than one Spirit in them.

<p>I guess it would make sense if Glitztrap was that way? When that theory first came out and we started theorizing about Tape Girl, I saw some comments saying that Michael was creating an &ldquo;army of Glitztraps&rdquo; by using the Beta Testers of the game assembling the tapes. That could be multiple souls in one Glitztrap suit that escapes into the real world.</p>

<li>
<p>FNAF is just the plot of a magical girl anime</p>

<p>the fnaf lore: and it won’t stop coming and it won’t stop coming and it won’t stop comin-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think scott is finishing the whole fnaf franchise until it reaches to fnaf 10</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“I will hold him there” say Andrew. Orville elephant said</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matpat: &ldquo;WE SOLVED GOLDEN FREDDY!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scott: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna do what&rsquo;s called a pro gamer move&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I bet Matpat was super excited for the FNAF reveal on the PS showcase 😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember the one time in the &ldquo;silver eyes&rdquo; book that Mat mentioned that all the agony inside of the robot of silver eyes, which is now the metal body of the stitch Wraith, was actually the spirit of a grieving father? Well since Charlie was in the scene, I had the acknowledgment that the grieving father that was holding the Ella doll was none other than Henry Emily. He must be the spirit who&rsquo;s causing all the zaps from the stitch  Wraith&rsquo;s hands while Jake controls the body, able to see and maneuver wherever, and Andrew amps up the agony Henry had built up inside the robot that used to have a head, able to listen to the outside world and torment William Afton while far away from the hospital. I hope you find this info helpful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought about it and it now finally makes sense. So we have 5 animatronics with 6 souls which are melted into one remnant and then become Funtime Animatronics. There is soul of Elisabeth Afton who also haunts Baby. Then they became Ennard, they escape through Michael, yeah, we know that story. What comes next? I think Elisabeth separate from others and became Scrap Baby and other six are still there. And in FNaF 3 we have our Happiest Day which is actually party for Crying Child, the one of two souls in Golden Freddy. At the end 5 souls can go but we don&rsquo;t have Golden Freddy&rsquo;s mask because Cassidy&rsquo;s role isn&rsquo;t complete. She stays in Molten Freddy and she burns with William Afton and others in Freddy Fazbear&rsquo;s Pizzeria Simulator. I guess, that makes sense and it&rsquo;s only possible way. Crying Child is happy at least because of birthday he could never truly appreciate is coming real and kids in masks, representing ones that killed him, help him. And that&rsquo;s the story, I guess. That doesn&rsquo;t really tell us why other 4 souls could go then and ending with masks suggest that it&rsquo;s something that happens. Maybe it&rsquo;s because they aren&rsquo;t as vengeful as Cassidy but we don&rsquo;t really know</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;What a gift to relish, a victim that CAN&rsquo;T PERISH&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matpat: We solved it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scott: We dont do that here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dear Mat Pat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a small theory that can add on to this&hellip; what if the Crying Child still is one of the spirits that inhabit Golden Freddy, but the Crying Child is STILL Michael Afton. Think about it. In the final cut scene of Sister Location (the one where Micheal says &lsquo;father its me Micheal&rsquo;) Micheal sounds robotic when he says &lsquo;im going to come find you&rsquo; for a second time. If Foxy Bro is truly Micheal, then how did he survive the scoop? Why does he sound robotic? This means that the William DID put Micheal back together.This also proves that when the spirit of Micheal says &lsquo;its me&rsquo; to the Robot Micheal, he is saying: &lsquo;Its me. Im the real Micheal.&rsquo; Thats what i think though. I would be happy if you, Mat Pat , would look into it.I think it would be interesting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So with this theory in mind does that mean in the new FNAF Security Breach, the vengeful soul is trying to save George, the character we may play as, from the new killer Vanny which was technically created by the vengeful spirit letting William live and inhabiting the game to &ldquo;mind control&rdquo; the beta testers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gotta say after years of trying to figure out fnaf he’s still going. That’s dedication</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hello, Matpat. I have a theory that I think you may be interested in.

<li>
<p>So&hellip;in the Fnaf Security Breach trailer, A voice which belongs to I suppose Vanny, tells a kid named Gregory that she is sorry for being short tempered. So I know that this is gonna sound far-fetched&hellip;but I think Vanny is Gregory&rsquo;s mother.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think Scott is a drug dealer and his best drug is “fnaf” and Matt is his favorite customer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;&lsquo;&lsquo;Alright Scott, don&rsquo;t you release a game on us or anything&rsquo;&rsquo;   LMAO 8 days after this video the new game got announced for the PS5</p>
</li>

<p>Matpat: makes this video</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scott Cawthon: time to spin the wheel again</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>since 2015 you have always found a way to twist my stomach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seeing that all along only one of Golden Freedie&rsquo;s eyes is lit up hits different now that I know there are 2 souls and only one can see</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MatPat: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve finally solved Fnaf!&rdquo; Hallelujah!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scott Cawthon: How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now I’m excited to find out the other kids’ backstories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that Freddy is helping with us</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wait wasnt there a kid with an alligator mask in happiest day?</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Scott: laughs in gamelore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This game is the definition of &ldquo;Just one more before bed&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You know in ULC, how if you death coin Withered GF, you get jumpscared by Fredbear? What if Cassidy is controlling Fredbear and when Golden Freddy gets eliminated, it allows Cassidy to attack William Afton.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And what about Susie?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&hellip;you know, the last story in the fourth book of the Fazbear Fright series? And what about the stories „Bunny Call“ and „In the Flesh“ in the fifth book? I think they are worth for another video, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ok picture this, scott next to a computer, about to make the next game, and mat sees him. Mat &ldquo;hes just standing, menecingly!!!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is what my 2020 has come to, listening to FNAF theory, a game I haven&rsquo;t had interest in for years.

</li>
<li>
<p>2100:   Oliver: this time, I swear, we solved fnaf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scot: new game!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mat marking 30 new “we were wrong” videos and 17 mental breakdowns: do this is the last game right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MatPat: Use audible to get through these scary stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>*plays jumpscare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: what a great way to end a scary theory. With a jumpscare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MatPat: AUDIBLE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“You don’t just survive one-liners like that”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matpat: AAAAAAAAA I SOLVED GOLDEN FREDDY! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scott: G R E G O R Y</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Game Theorists channel would have never succeeded, without your awesome voice!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So are we going to ignore how Scott made a character named Matt, impregnated him with a baby springtrap, and then killed him off?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who else is hyped for FNAF movie? I&rsquo;ve been waiting so long.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matt: solving FNAF theories</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>FNAF Security B’: Hah, I’m dead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice that the week after this was posted, Scott dropped the Security Breach trailer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly, at this point, every time I see a MatPat FNAF theory video with &ldquo;solved&rdquo; in the title I just smile to myself and wait for the next reveal for the FNAF franchise that will disprove this and drive MatPat more insane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wondered if this was just a coincidence (I doubt there are coincidences in fnaf&hellip;) but has anyone wondered why the fnaf jumpscare sounds are different? Like maybe its because the animatronics change?? I don&rsquo;t frickin&rsquo; know..

<li></li>
<li>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t get this from any other guy</p>

<li>
<p>That feeling, when you didn&rsquo;t read any realised book, so haven&rsquo;t any single idea what exactly going on in this theory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we all just appreciate game theory’s editing, it is on a next level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it was the crying child saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me&rdquo; the whole time to his brother then why did he say it to Freddy in that cutscene in FNAF 2? Also, I thought the crying child was rebuilt as an animatronic by William?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope he does a theory over security breach trailer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he attac, he protec, but most importantly he always comes bac</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched this with a cracked screen and somehow it made it look cooler cuz each murder is a new crack in the story</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He did not just say these words:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;He attacc.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;He protecc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I unsubscribed a few years ago but today I thought to myself &ldquo;I wonder what Game Theory is up to nowadays&rdquo; so I come here and am deigned to see a FNAF Game Theory video in the year of our Lord 2020. You are Anitya&rsquo;s exception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Afton survived fnaf3, so I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he survived fnaf 6.</p>

<p>Mat whenever scott releases something:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ah jes, its all coming together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me after watching every golden Freddy theory: How many’s lies I’ve been told.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I see one problem with the theory:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Cassidy is talking to the crying child how could she have written it in the logbook?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>everybody gangsta till its herobrine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Idk if you mentioned this but i noticed something so you see one kid “couldn’t see” the other “could see” look at the eyes it appears as if only one can see thats just more proof thanks for your time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the real reason mat avoided the other 2 stories was cuz he got pregnant in one of them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me when FNAF was new: &ldquo;Yeah whatever&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me now: &ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So he’s just going to ignore the fact of the matpat mpreg fanfic?</p>

<p>I start questioning reality when you say &ldquo;but hey this is just a theory&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think i have a theory:</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>In the Emily Family, its said that they had 2 kids, a girl and a boy, and there is a reason why Henry wife divorced.and its because the boy was missing.the girl name is Charlie and the boy name is Sammy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We should start taking the, “I always come back,” line more seriously.</p>

<p>So now that you&rsquo;re dying scott, could you us the full story of fnaf?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well&hellip; It all started when it was simple, then I found this famous kid named what, pancake? Flapjack? No it was mat pat, now he started making theories on my games, so I got an idea</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of running the show myself, I&rsquo;d have him lead on the story, I threw out the seeds and he watered them. I loved in his videos when he said he was going insane, it was always funny to me. And tell my wife and kids that I lo-</p>

<p>Afton: *dies for like the 5th time&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Grim Reaper: &ldquo;sooooo you wanna come with me THIS time?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Afton: &ldquo;NEVER&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I honestly wonder how Scott Cawthon keeps making new lore for everyone to put together, he kept this up for 6 years. I applaud you Scott.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just some food for thought here, but i propose to you this hypothesis. What if the crying child and Michael, were never aftons. What if they were the sons of Henry Emily. And then, what if after the demise of Charlotte and Crying child and Henry&rsquo;s suicide, Michael was taken in by William Afton, after he lost Elizabeth. And afterword, what if he was somehow brainwashed of hypnotized into either forgetting his past as an Emily, becoming the successor to Williams murdering, or heck, even both. This would perfectly explain his weird behavior in sister location, him calling William &ldquo;Father&rdquo; in sister location, the belief of Elizabeth being his sister in that same game, and the question  from cassidy/crying child  to him in the logbook of &ldquo;Do you remember your name?&quot;. Furthermore it would also help explain the line of &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me&rdquo; from golden freddy, reminding Michael, if that even is his real name at this point, his past. And that at some point towards the end of the games he somehow regains his lost memories. This would also explain midnight motorist as well. Again, this is just me speculating and there is almost no evidence, but it is a possibility at the very least.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my persobal theory is that what mike meant was that in fnaf 1 we can see him appearing as hallucinations and moving at his own will. I personally think they meant the patiant being william afton and glitchtrap together. Mike is torturing william through hallucinations,a nd maybe perhaps since William is inside the animatronic Spring Bonnie when he dies, like the other kids, hsi soul is trapped. Thus that makes him still alive.  But then that leads to what mike meant. Maybe he had something to do with William still alive?? Maybe when the four kids left, he brought William&rsquo;s body out of the fire. And once he does, he plans to torture William even more? Maybe he does that by torturing his son until his death bc he is one of his nightmares? Idk, but hey, it&rsquo;s just a theory&hellip;&hellip;</p>
