<p>5 days later: school died</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I used to read every single geronimo stilton book. and i did&hellip; then all of a sudden i read them in 20 minutes&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>high school ruined everyone&rsquo;s love of reading&hellip;or at least mine did with the stupid summer reading crap</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how to prove she didn’t pay attention she put “Juliet = Lesbian??” On the notebook page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jaiden: &ldquo;School kinda ruined books for me&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>School ruins everything it touches by making it into a requirement smh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If schools didn’t pressurise us, people would be writing, reading, and doing art way more often.</p>

<p>Back when books became a thing,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people thought it was bad just like we do now about tv and phones</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;i would rather do literally nothing than read a book&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i have this problem but instead of reading a book its doing literally anything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People: &ldquo;I like reading&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School: &ldquo;Awesome! Read this!&rdquo;</p>
</li>

<p>People: &ldquo;no. I don&rsquo;t think I will&rdquo;</p>

<p>Me: “Me too, it’s boring”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also Me: Reads the Comments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t like how everything is told to me. In comics or animations we see what happens but in book it takes 4 pages to set up a scene because they have to explain how everything looks. This is what I liked about diary of a whimpy kid because there they didn’t do that.</p>

<p>Coronavirus: Allow me.</p>

<li>
<p>I only like the Percy Jackson books, I ey hate reading it&rsquo;s just how slow and boring reading is. But I LOVE the Percy Jackson books.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moral of the story?</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Forced reading sucks, free reading’s cool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When i saw the huckleberry finn reference i realized that i still need to read till chapter 4 &hellip;.. hand hits the head</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The warrior cats reference. Well that makes me feel old. Surprisingly fun in spite of the whack premise! But I get the whole forced reading poisoning the well. I actually read to kill a mockingbird on my own terms when I was I think 12 (I really liked reading and was pretty good at it so my parents would recommend books to me as I think a stealthy way to get me engaged with important subjects at a younger age&hellip;it probably worked) and really enjoyed the book and was really engaged with its themes. When I had to read it again for my English Lit GCSE I hated EVERY second I spent with it because I just wanted to do my own thing. Often I&rsquo;d read way ahead even in class just to make it reading on my own terms so I could actually enjoy the book the way you are supposed to and not get bogged down in reading waaay to hard into symbolism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: sees the book warriors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also me: like like like like like like like</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can relate I HATE READING can we throw all the books in a volcano</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the animals were communist, but some were more communist than others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: trying to look for everyone&rsquo;s animal crossing friend code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the comments: JAIDENS A FURRY!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The library of my school is locked NOOOOOOOOO MONSTER QUEST NOOOOOOOO</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oml, you read warrior cats? Im so-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The part that made me hate reading for me is the &ldquo;Writing about Reading.&rdquo; Even for the grade of finding and/or Writing the themes, symbolism,  Character development, and other English crap, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth for entering my english class or seeing/hearing about a book!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone: “likes reading books”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School: “read this one, it’s great”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone: “well now I am not doing it”

<li>
<p>Also me: doesn’t win</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im like the opposite because I love it when other people choose books for me but when I choose it on my own I always choose really crappy and boring books and I don&rsquo;t end up reading them</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>me: I LOVE reading</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>School killed my art passion dead because when I went into secondary school I was forced to learn colour theory even though I know what it is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tea with a good book??? This remenber me some really bad memories like</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ehhh well like school is alright but I don’t love it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s the same thing with chores you say “I’m gonna clean my room!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But then your parents walk in and say “clean your room” and then you don’t wanna do it anymore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suggesting a good book series, it’s called Wings of Fire (yes, it is an audible book and a graphic novel too). It’s a series about dragons by Tui T Sutherland. It’s really good! There’s three arcs in the series, but so you know it’s pretty violent, so&hellip;&hellip;.best not to animate the death of a certain dragon that had to die or kill someone in the first place&hellip;.but he died by using a dragon that is basically on fire but immune to her fire to kill himself in book one&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
</li>

<p>I love reading, helped me through the last few years of highschool. But this year was my first year at university (rip online study). The first trimester was on campus, and it was alright, aside from the fact that one class demanded I read four books in the span of like&hellip; 8 weeks or something. They weren&rsquo;t relatively big (one book was thick but it was a bunch of short stories) but I had like 3 other classes I had to study for on top of assignments and travelling to campus and just trying to live some sort of life idk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like FORCED READING  but i like normal reading JAYDEN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I was able to crush a three hundred pager in two days! Which I don&rsquo;t think is impressive anymore-&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everyone: makes a comment about Jaiden&rsquo;s disdain for reading.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Me: Oh wow, young Jaiden has a new hair style. I like it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My boyfriend is just like that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got two elder scrolls books with an adrenaline filled story and he loves elder scrolls but refuses to read the books because he hates reading and if they were games he&rsquo;d definitely play them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s just a hardcore gamer and i can&rsquo;t change that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well ima recomend one anyway DIARY OF A WIMPY KID I love them I was able to finish some of the books in two days I loved reading them I&rsquo;ve finished them one of my friends got me to read them</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is actually my third attempt at doing this. The first time, i didnt save it. The second time, the Neocities editor crashed. Now im writing this in Notepad, then copying the Neocites editor instead of typing it directly in the Neocites editor to avoid crashing. It sucks that my past two attempts are gone now. Those actually got pretty long. Not long long, but still pretty long. I hope this wont get lost somehow. Anyways, lets talk about WAFFLES! I like waffles. Waffles are cool. Waffles is a funny word. Theres a Teen Titans Go episode where they said waffles over a hundred times. Its pretty annoying. Theres also a Teen Titans Go episode about Pig Latin. Dont know what Pig Latin is, but i think its this language where you take all the consonants before the first vowel, move them to the end, and add &ldquo;-ay&rdquo; to the end. If the word begins with a vowel, you just add &ldquo;-way&rdquo; to the end. For example, Waffles becomes &ldquo;Afflesway&rdquo; . Iv&rsquo;e been speaking Pig Latin fluently since the fourth grade, so it surprised me when i saw the episode for the first time. I speak Pig Latin with my brother sometimes. It&rsquo;s pretty fun. I like speaking it in public so that everyone around us gets confused. That&rsquo;s actually never happened before, but if it ever does &lsquo;twill be pretty funny. By the way, &lsquo;twill is a word i invented recently, and its a contraction of &ldquo;it will&rdquo; . I really hope it gains popularity in the future, because &lsquo;twill is WAY more fun than saying &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll&rdquo; . &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll&rdquo; is too (i cant read that word srry-) likes boring. This is nowehre near being the longest text ever, but eventually it will be! I might still be writing this a decade later, who knows? But right now its not very long. (Jaiden my fingers are already burning-) But i&rsquo;ll keep writing until its the longest! Have you ever heard the song &ldquo;Dau Dau&rdquo; by Awesome Scampis? It&rsquo;s a amazing song. Look it up on YouTube! I play that song all the time around my sister and it drives her crazy, and i love it. Another way i like driving my sister crazy is by speaking my own made up language to her. She hates the languages i make! The only (idk) i speak besides English and Pig Latin. I think you already knew that. Whatever. I think I&rsquo;m gonna go for now. Bye!</p>

<p>I’m doing animal farm!!!!! And my dad wants me to watch the cartoon with him too 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only books I read involve a demon who harvests the skin of humans over and over again at his happy farm to make magic scrolls. And a skeleton man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listen I like books .BUT!!! teachers tell you to read more you have to read every day they it will be fun they say. then suddenly they also say you also have a test on this book. I hate when that happens don&rsquo;t they know that&rsquo;s taking the fun out of it!!!so yes I agree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like the only book that I was hooked onto was 100 dresses. It&rsquo;s a really good book you should check it out.</p>

<p>I just finished an Audiobook called &ldquo;Der Schwarm&rdquo; by Frank Schätzing, in the USA it was published by the name &ldquo;The Swarm&rdquo;. Initially I read the normal book, but somehow stopped haöf way through, so about 3 weeks ago I decided to give the audiobook a try. And I must say, it is the best sci-fi i have read in a long time. To be short, it is about a superior intelligence living in the seas. It has a kind of slow start but also epic showdowns over many chapters. It poses phillsophical questions and is very well researched on a scientific basis. The main characters are lovable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When there was Words in the background all i chould foces on was &ldquo;my english code&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 3 weeks and I don&rsquo;t think anyone has mentioned the writing in the background when she&rsquo;s talking about stressing while reading</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actually in my school we had a library period and I was forced to read a book so instead of reading a book sneaked and took the newest Guinness world records book</p>

<p>I still love reading books or listening to Audiobooks to this day but back then it was almost ruined for me so our elementary school told us to pick a book that has a sticker of the first letter of your name and i thought &ldquo;Okay that sounds fun&rdquo; my class went and they founded all these fun and colorful looking books while i was the only one who had this grey disgusting 1940&rsquo;s book about pinwheels and i told my teacher can i find a book that starts with the first letter of my last name cause the ones that has stickers of O looked WAY more interesting but she suddenly got mad cause she thought i was complaining even tho i was only asking then i told my mom and even she got bored of reading it with me</p>

<p>I went a good 10 years without reading after I was forced to in school and I still do it very rarely. Although another reason is my imagination is awful so I can&rsquo;t picture the setting in a book at all so it ends up totally paling in comparison to watching TV/Movies.</p>

<p>I used to LOVE reading and could read huge books in a couple days, but the moment I was forced to read I began to hate it! It honestly still affects me to this day especially when it comes to text readings for college class. I&rsquo;m 22 now :&gt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone: “likes reading books”</p>
</li>

<p>The anime re zero got me into reading as i started reading the light novels. Season two is currently airing and I am always just a few chapters ahead of the anime meaning that I know what’s gonna happen. I CAN READ FOR 10 MINUTES AND THE EXACT SAME HAPPENS IN THE ANIME IN 1 MINUTE!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s always the double bind that gets ya, forcing someone to do a voluntary act, involuntary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can read a book from the library just fine, but if it counts as my grade, I just can&rsquo;t. I know I should, but I just can&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I recently started the “Lockwood &amp;Co.” book series and I’ve enjoyed up until the point I am at now and I’m sure I will continue to enjoy it even as an 11-year-old. Lockwood&amp;Co. is a supernatural based story and is written from the perspective of one of the main characters; Lucy Carlyle. She is made out to be “not one of the prettiest” girls out there and a very talented ghost hunter. She has an enhanced skill in listening out for all different types of ghosts, but sometimes she ends up being too sensitive about the supernatural sensations coming from that power.</p>

<p>I used to hate reading for the same reasons jaiden did, but when I got to my preteen years I discovered my love for comics. They had good storytelling and cool art. The first one I got around that time was deadpool Dracula gauntlet, and I remember really liking it. After that I began reading Hellboy comics, then Hellboy novels, and now I’m working on collecting all of the Hellboy and B.P.R.D comics. I’ve also started reading The New Thrawn trilogy,  I’ve read the perks of being a wallflower, and I got Mary shelly’s Frankenstein. But now I have a problem, I’ve got too many books and now I don’t have enough time or the attention span to read all of them.

<p>I loved reading with my grandmother when I was younger, I believe I had reading skills of grade 12 in 3rd grade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had teachers shit on me for reading too fast or reading too slow or deciding to pick up a picture book once in a while.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I might recommend a book regardless of the fact you&rsquo;re probably not going to read it:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fortunately, the Milk by Neil Gaiman</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite short and has a lot of pictures and the story is insane. This man just wants to get milk for his kids but ends up doing a load of other stuff like time traveling. It&rsquo;s really good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yup, i think it&rsquo;s not about only reading a book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if someone force me to do something, it will be like&hellip; &ldquo;i don&rsquo;t want to do that&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>even when i actually want to do something and there are someone that tell me to do that same something, in my head &ldquo;i am going to do that, but because u tell me, i am not going to do that&rdquo;

<p>The thing about Jaiden is that she&rsquo;s the normal typical kid. Forced reading, hates it now, thinks animals are communist. Typical</p>
</li>

<p>Me: reads Sherlock Holmes and some other stuff the whole day during summer vacation</p>

<p>Everyone: Well now im not doing it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I used to love reading. Read couple hundred page books throughout the day when I was in 3-4 grade(s) but then reading became terrible because I started associating it with punishment and having far below mediocre remixes of the dictionary shoved into me by school and to this day I hate reading. Couldn&rsquo;t even get through reading the boy in the striped pajamas and that has very positive reviews. The most I&rsquo;ll read is a song&rsquo;s worth of lyrics or whatever pops up onscreen in like, a Sam O&rsquo;nella video or something</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should read the Percy Jackson books, they&rsquo;re  getting a Disney+ series</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;All the animals are Communists&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So I see I&rsquo;m not the only one with that conclusion from the Animal Farm</p>

<li>
<p>High School made me read Shakespeare two out of the only three times I needed to read so I was fine. I was the only one who loved it so I was cool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like books because they can explain a story without showing images and/or sounds and they have to be the most accurate and descriptive. The stories are freaking impressive. Not saying I don&rsquo;t like movies, i love videogames too.</p>

<p>I had to read in front of random stargers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And guess what happend</p>
</li>

<p>In a Nutshell: You lose interest, if someone forces you to do something</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I read it as. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the 16-year old who won $3 at the fortnite world cup.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I loved the Molly Moon series!!! For the past couple of months I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out what the name of it was cause I read it all the time in elementary school, haha. Thanks for reminding me! :^0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s true</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jaiden: I finish a 200 page book in two days in fifth grade</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: I finish a 300 page book in 2 days in second grade</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Author: The door is red</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>English teacher: This represents how the author was angry and experiencing a flood of emotional while combatting fear, rage and depression while having extreme stress in his/her family and was expressing her/his rage via text by implying that the author is trapped just like the narrator and wants to escape a tidal of rage and fear and emotion.</p>
</li>

<p>I used to love reading, I&rsquo;d get so into the book that I could actually see what was happening and I could hear the voices. it was like I was watching TV and I&rsquo;d stay up all night reading by flashlight. eventually my weird delusions stopped and I was just looking at paper with some ink on it. the last book I read was part of the Edge Chronicles series. I think it was during the 3rd arc of the series, the part with the free gladers or whatever they were called, the one who built a flying motorcycle out of wood, I was like halfway through the book when I had to return it to the library because I was going on a trip and never went back, I loved that series, the sky pirates, the Gloamglozer, the bander bears and the waifs, the caterbirds and the shrikes, but for whatever reason i never went back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I agree jaiden I remember I used to like reading books like goose bumps and animal now I just hate reading at all bc now i feel pressured into reading and thats what made me hate reading more than i used to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I relate to this so hard. In late elementary school-early middle school I was able to read like 5 Harry Potter books within like a year, then when I started playing games my mom went to the extreme and tried to limit me playing as much as she could(didn’t work cause I was sneaky) and she would shove books in my face often. She at least tried to pick books that fit my interests and sometimes just took me to Barnes and Noble(which is super relaxing to go to) to pick one myself. Made me dislike reading for awhile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5:47 mee too, when I have to draw something or working on my homework I&rsquo;d rather watch someone&rsquo;s live stream or long videos instead of a music, while slowly working on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Reading is boring.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>laughs in scripts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The novels I read are &ldquo;too dark&rdquo; for school and so I can&rsquo;t use them in any reviews</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Animal farm&hellip; as a french who’s forced to read it «For realise that all animal are communist » it resume it perfectly xD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have ALWAYS loved reading♡

<p>So a quick question, at 0:18 you stated that in that such environment it is very enjoyable for someone to read there. Here comes my question, would it be just as enjoyable as when I am reading a Stephen king novel?</p>
