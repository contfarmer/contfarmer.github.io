He always look at other girls and we always fight; rarely, with physical. He became like always angry at me. His parents always teasing me with how fat I am. I started having depression and anxiety.</li>

<li>anyone do this naturally because they don‚Äôt wake up till after 12 üòÇ</li>
<li>When I did this I started going to bed earlier to stop myself from eating üòÇ</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s really hard to diet when you have to eat your family&rsquo;s food. I feel like I can go on a diet very easily but since I live in an Asian household, most of the ingredients aren&rsquo;t in my house, so I have to go and buy stuff which costs me a lot.</li>
<li>For the girls with extra weight and body image issues.</li>
<li></li>
<li>I love you, don&rsquo;t deprive yourself. You are perfect. Take your goals one at a time‚ô° GOOD LUCK</li>
<li>Chloe: make sure to get enough sleep</li>
<li>Me at 5am: üëÅüëÑüëÅ</li>

<li>who&rsquo;s here because you&rsquo;re bored being quarantined</li>
<li>Hi I&rsquo;ve been doing her standing abs workout for 2 weeks now and I already saw minor changes but I&rsquo;m always not happy with my body. 1 like = 1 day of doing intermittent fasting plus minimal exercises! I need motivation ;-; thank you!</li>

<p>Me who ate a whole cake after a 16 hours fasting: sweats nervously</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A warning for people wanting to try IF:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one chooses to get an ED, but this may increase the chances of getting one if you are prone to it. Personally, I started my transformation 2 years ago after graduating High School. I wanted to have a glow up during the summer, so I began dieting &amp; exercising normally. I saw results in 3 days and I was hooked, I became addicted to the lbs dropping and I began to eat far below the healthy amount. Now, 2 years later, I&rsquo;m at bmi 16 which is dangerously low. Right now I&rsquo;m trying to learn to love myself, and I have seen improvement since I no longer cry at my reflection, I feel more confident, I wear what I want, and I eat more now. I hope that others don&rsquo;t fall where I did and I hope those who already have can rise back up and take their life back. God bless everyone and I pray all of you find happiness, for you are Loved &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>even if i wanted to do this, my parents wouldn‚Äôt let me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her: intermittent fasting is easy and great!</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>its really hard to do diet when your family makes alot of food üò©</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me I don&rsquo;t know if intermediate fasting is for me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Chloe</em>some women lost their period intermediate fasting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me well it&rsquo;s worth a shot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is long, but if you read it, thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôve never been hungry in the mornings. Never. Was never a breakfast person! My biggest problem in the last two years (I don‚Äôt know what happened in those two years lol) was eating lots of sweets after dinner in the evenings, up until I went to bed. I guess I became addicted to sugar. So obviously I started gaining weight. In two years I‚Äôve gained 14 pounds. Now, during quarantine I‚Äôve changed my eating habits and exercising following Chloe‚Äôs routines. Now for the last two and a half months I‚Äôve  had an intermittent fasting window from 12-6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am doing an intermittent fasting, I just started yesterday! And I didn&rsquo;t think I would go through with this and try, but I need to stay motivated!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 Like = 1 day of intermittent fasting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we muslims actually do this for a month each year it is actually amazing since everybody is fasting with you , so you won&rsquo;t feel that hungry XD</p>

<p>I eat because I‚Äôm bored. Like, if I‚Äôm entertained, I won‚Äôt eat. I could be starving for food and I wouldn‚Äôt feel a thing if I were playing video games and I was having fun. Usually when my video games are loading, I eat because I‚Äôm bored. I don‚Äôt know what to do because I can‚Äôt give myself constant entertainment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her eyes look like an anime character. Thats pretty cool üëçüèΩ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: imma do this intermittent casting hMmMMM</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>My asian mom: Ugh NO</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Started doing IF because being in quarantine had me eating all day everyday, constant snacking on junk food that started to become habit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm doing 16/8, 1pm to 9pm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like I do intermittent fasting naturally, am not a breakfast person and sometime I go without food until 3 in the evening</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chloe: you need to get enough sleep</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My brain at 6am: starts repeating what I studied yesterday</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muslims : am i a joke to u ? (16 hrs of fasting 8hrs of eating ) basically ramadan hahahahahag</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, can you share with us your schedule when you tried doing intermittent diet. When do you include workouts?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me fasting for a month every year because that&rsquo;s in my religion &ldquo;islam&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I actually fast 16 hours&hellip;  no food and no drinks.. and i workout 1 hour before the fasting time ends and it really works..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me watching this on June 2020:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chloe: Go out for a walk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>me : Honey we are in quarantine :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IF is really effective. I started last year, October 2019, and my weight before I started was 65kg. After two weeks, I lost 3kg. I stopped when I got into a relationship because we ate a lot üòÜ I‚Äôm back with 65kg. I started IF again last week, wish me luck!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Am I the only one who was on this and didn‚Äôt even know about it? In 6 months i lost 15 kilosü§™</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im in a  planking position while watching this. I need a distraction from the burn üòÇ

<li>
<p>i literally do this for a month every year &hellip;cuz i am a Muslim and i gotta intermittent fast in Ramadan hahah</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I started 10 days ago, my energy had increased, my stomach feels less bloated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey chloe ting, can I still exercise while on my intermittent fasting?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muslims after Ramadan seeing this:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why don‚Äôt I have abs?! WHY DONT I HAVE ABS?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wheres my Muslim folk waiting for Ramadan üôå</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 like 1 day of 8:16 intermittent fasting.starting weight 84kgs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thnks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its so hard especially when ur in the house now in time of quarantine im doing the 20/4</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you came here just to know how to  do intermittent fasting but end up learning a year worth of biology classü§ß</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guys I really wanna go for a run but I‚Äôm afraid of people that know me seeing me any tips on how to get over this fear? I‚Äôm body conscious&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am so stuck in my fitness journey. I&rsquo;ve simply been losing and regaining belly fat and it&rsquo;s somewhat taking a toll on how I feel about myself.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;d try out this for a weeküò•üòìüòì</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ive been doing this for over 4 weeks now!! it makes me feel good in the morning no bloat üòä</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôve been intermittent fasting for months now, and I think it really gave me all the discipline I could dream of when it comes to eating. If you can control when you eat, you can also control what you eat, so long as you are nourished. I do not have any issues eating anything I don‚Äôt mean to eat. I eat much healthier too, because I have more time to plan meals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Day 3:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Probably I can make it throughout this quarantine. üòå</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on my first day, I noticed how my stomach looked flat a little, today is my second day. I need motivation tho :((</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have started Intermittent fasting with 16:8 method and in the morning I follow your 2 weeks fat burn exercises . Hope I will get better result . Finger crossed ü§ûüèª

<p>after 1 week of intermittent fasting I&quot;ve gone from 138 down to 131. I&rsquo;m so shocked because I haven&rsquo;t weighed so little since i was a freshman in highschool! it really does work and it makes it easy!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Felt like I&rsquo;ve been taking 2 steps forward, 1 step back with my weight loss journey&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve started losing hope. But this has given me new life, I&rsquo;m excited to try it! Here goes nothing ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just realized my daily routine is called intermittent fasting and I feel great ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t even know i&rsquo;ve been doing the intermittent fasting this whole time woah</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ok but her before picture is practically my goal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muslim people do this and I think it works very well but after a few months I gain weight lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yeahh..I&rsquo;ve been in this IF mode since 2018 ,  my weight is sustainable while I eat without so much restriction. I&rsquo;m 45 yo..so I need to keep my weight stable all the time and with IF it is possible(158cm/50kg)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I actually have been doing this method since high school and I never realized it. I skip breakfast cuz I had hard classes in the morning, I would only eat a whole lunch and snack in between classes, and I‚Äôd do sports at night and only eat snacks and drink lots of water for dinner while I studied more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That‚Äôs still my eating habit through college except I reduced exercising a bit. No wonder I haven‚Äôt been gaining too much weight but I‚Äôm not as strong as I used to either. üòÖ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After I was done with the chloe ting two week shred, back in may, I started intermittent fasting and eating healthy and so far I‚Äôve lost 11 kg I went from 64-52kg just make sure to do it safely don‚Äôt restrict and have fun :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In islam we fast for a whole month from dawn till sunset, it‚Äôs about 15 hours of fasting in my country. It‚Äôs wonderful and spiritual and most people tend to lose a lot of weight during that month. BTW you are the reason I decided to start working out and to abstain from my bad eating habits üíú</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I started intermittent fasting a little before quarantine started, for 77 days to be exact lol. You guys should use this app called Zero if you‚Äôre interested in trying IF. It helped me be consistent with my fasting hours. :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing 20hours fasting and 4 Hours eating window! Today is my Day 1 so far so good, I didn&rsquo;t feel hungry at all.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Will update you after 10 Days!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When u watching this while fasting in ramadan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey Chloe, when you discussed the con of losing muscle mass, if you&rsquo;re training with weights and resistance and focusing on muscle growth can you still experience the loss of muscle during the intermittent fasting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to do this but I‚Äôm stressed and have an eating disorder so I guess it‚Äôs a no lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for your recommendations. I&rsquo;m going to try it.

<p>I&rsquo;m into Intermittent Fasting for the past few months and I really feel light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We in Ramadan fast 16 hour&rsquo;s just like this diet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just saw an ad intermittent fasting before this ad lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how you come with ur references! Seriously a good influencer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great tips! I liked how  you mentioned the emotional aspects of it. Also some women lose their hair. Be aware. Keep a good nutritional balanced diet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been intermittent fasting since 1 month. I eat pretty healthy too. I&rsquo;ve also been working out but I don&rsquo;t see any result üò£</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watching this after I absolutely gorged myself on sweet and sour rips</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great video! I have been doing Intermittent Fasting for over 3 months. I have lost a total of 31 pounds. I started at 176 pounds with a 34 inch waist. I am now down to 145 pounds and only 28 inch waist. I am in the best shape of my life. I originally started doing IF with 16:8 and slowly lowered my eating window to 4 hrs eating 2 meals a day. On the 2nd month I started to try eating One Meal A Day (OMAD) and that was when the fat just fell off my body.  I have been on OMAD for over 2 months now, it was extremely hard for the first 8-9 days but now I am used to it. There are a lot of myths that you will lose muscle when fasting and thats 100% false, while fasting not only will your body will burn fat, it will also generate more HGH which will help you grow muscle. I now have a six pack and I think the last time I had a six pack was in high school. IF is not a diet, its a eating schedule and once you adapt it, it just becomes a lifestyle, I think its pretty easy but most of all it is a very healthy and natural way to lose fat. I posted 2 videos on my channel during my journey with weekly photos to see the transformation for those that dont believe its possible. For those that are looking to try, I highly recommend it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait so what time should I start eating at these times üòÇ like with all the different fasting times</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really love you Chloe!!! I‚Äôm planning on doing intermittent..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can teenagers do intermittent fasting?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chloe: Intermittent fasting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: Ramadan fasting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do the 14/10 everyday because at night I eat really early haha. Gonna try the 16/8.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did it a month ago and yeah, intermittent fasting really works‚ô•Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did IF a few years ago, it&rsquo;s really amazing for helping with weight loss/management. I lost all my baby weight and was full of energy! I didn&rsquo;t count calories at all and just ate sensibly with a small treat at the end of my last meal. Need to start this again as had another baby 7months ago but breastfeeding makes me so hungry ü§£</p>

<p>I just watched this, I started IF since today üòä excited!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it okay to practice intermittent fasting while doing one of your challenges, like the 35 days one? If yes, what would be a good time to do it in the 16-8 framework? Thanks! &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I tried this the first time, I was shaking. But when I started to do it again, it was more easy that from 16/8, I didn&rsquo;t notice that I was doing it 18/6 already.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>We do that one month , &lsquo;&lsquo;ramadan &quot; ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didnt realized that i have done intermittent fasting for a long time, until i saw the video XD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a question. These past few days I noticed I&rsquo;ve been sleeping for 10hrs since doing your 2 week challenge or maybe because I&rsquo;m on my period as of the moment and maybe the hormones add up to my sleeping hours. Would intermittent fasting still work even though in the 16hrs fasting period mostly consists of 10hrs of sleep, 2hrs of workout and the other hours for works and stuff like that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Been on intermittent fasting for 2 months now I started at 68kg now I&rsquo;m 55 kg , other than that I do your work outs and only eat rice on lunch and oatmeal or cereal on dinner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for this amazing content. Helps a bunch!</p>
</li>

<p>1 like = 1 day of intermittent fasting</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>I just started on Wednesday. Already feeling better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing Intermittent Fasting for 2 years and it is effective. I almost lost 10kgs!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m definitely gonna try this! You are so helpful thank you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to try this but I&rsquo;m 5 years into recovering from anorexia so I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll aggravate it. Is there a healthy way to do this, without getting my eating disorder back?</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>**update :: probably shouldn&rsquo;t try this as someone who&rsquo;s had an eating disorder bc im sliding into relapse now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôve been doing intermittent fasting for over a year and it works!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I lost 25kg with plan from website <em>Next Level Diet</em>. They have amazing team that helped me to get my six pack :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone give a dollar every time she says intermittent fasting</p>

<p>In ramzan we are already going through 16 hours of fasting and we have completed 21 days of fasting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I stated intermittent fasting today is my second day officially and I started out with 14:10 and I bumped it up a notch to 16:8 because I think i can handle it and it seem much easier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s my 2 days and I feel cool and more motivated for the week. I do some exercices from 2 weeks challenge so I hope that do the diff√©rence. I love you Chlo√© because youre so motivated and cutyyyy !!! Sorry if I write mistakes because I am french but seriously youre the one youtuber fitness who can motivated me like that. I hope you have results and dont forget : YOU&rsquo;RE BEAUTIFUL !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember when I did fasting. It truly works. I went from 160 lbs to 134 to 125 lbs.  Took me months to get to 125lbs. I‚Äôd say it took about 5 months</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ma&rsquo;am I already do this coz I wake up at 12 am lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Been fasting for almost 16 hrs a day . You feel well . You get good compliments and the best anti aging . People ask what Botox I use üòÉ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My sister keeps harping me about intermitent  fasting, so I was going to say no to her because I was planning to start excersicing, but then I saw this video and though: So, I guess if I get more fiber and proteines in my diet it could work. I think I&rsquo;m going to try to do both&hellip; low intensity and gradual, of course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When will be the best time to work out with intermittent fasting? Is it recommended?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get good abs and there&rsquo;s a frikkin food delivery app advertisement before this video.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you. :) I have heard that you have to do 18 hours of fasting to go into autothogy (getting rid of bad stuff and replacing it with good).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could you try doing it just one or two days per week? I think it will be hard for me to exercise and think properly otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My husband has been wanting to do this. I‚Äôm going to give it a go. On day 2 of your 2 week shred and I love it!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey! I would love to try intermittent fasting, but how do you work out during that time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have to go to sleep earlier when fasting? I always wondered it!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I lost 2kg in one week when I tried this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But then I gained it all back when I started eating like how I usually eat, lol I don‚Äôt really care because it was just a test</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today is my day 2. I‚Äôll upload the vid and pictures when I complete the challenges. So I‚Äôm doing both fasting n challenge. I love ur videos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gonna start this from tomorrow ‚úå ramazan makes it so much easier to follow this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey I am going to do this after 1 week and 4 days since I am already on a diet wish me luck

<p>When I started this IF I jump straight into 16/8 and I lost 5 kg in 1,5 months. It really works üòÅ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When is the best time to start. After eating breakfast or sleeping</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes!!! And it&rsquo;s all about discipline too ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can u continue IF after you&rsquo;re where ure at? Very lost with this bit‚ù§üòÇ i mean its way harder to lose weight when ure fit, and I get u gotta slowly increase ur calories to maintain it since you wanna eat less than what you where origionally were to lose it. Make sure its the correct amount by finding your calorie deficit and all, but can u just do this overall ur whole life?üíÄ is it healthy?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 days doing it now and getting used to it nowüòç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes it literally works !!!!  It&rsquo;s not even one week ..I have started feeling my tees are little loose on me..And my abdominal circumference has also decreased a bit ..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use the app Zero and it helped for me to get through my fasting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you so much for the video Chloe! I am very interested in this subject and your video helped me alot!!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What time Of day should I start first thing in the morning or closer to bedtime since I‚Äôll be sleeping for eight hours?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not even lying, i started doing intermittent fasting when i saw her results. aS a student, i dont rly fast for exactly 16 hrs. During school days i fast ard 12-14 hrs and during holidays i fast for 15-16 hrs. I started intermittent fasting abt 1-2 weeks ago, but i didnt do it everyday, only when my mom allows me to skip bfast and go for brunch. In total, i have fasted for abt ard 10 days in these two weeks i dont eat a lot too during eating hours cuz i just dont get hungry easily. my results were incredible. Ive lost 3kgs along with some exercise and im so happy abt it!! but pls rmb to hv a balanced diet or ull feel extremely tired. Def recommend trying intermittent fasting to those who are considering to!</p>

<li>(Ps: i just want to ask that can i start it anytime in a day? Like on the first day, i will eat in the morning and on the second day, I‚Äôll do it in the afternoon, right?)</li>
<li>Wow I stared doing this now on day 4! well I only stared eating 2 times a day and now when I eat I get full super fast and if I eat to much well, it‚Äôs not staying in! üò´</li>
<li>Hey Chloe, should I work out before ending my intermittent fasting?</li>
<li>hi chloe! Good day! would like to know do you still do your workout during these days?</li>
<li>This is just easy one..</li>
<li>Fasting plus exercise?</li>
<li>I can do that because I&rsquo;m not into food anyways Haha..</li>
<li>I will start tomorrow!! Right after my period omggg I can do it!!!</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m a christian and sometimes we do it from the beginning of the day (00:00 o&rsquo;clock) till either 12pm, 3pm or 6 pm depending on age, experience and health issues. I&rsquo;m 15 now and I decide to do it till 6pm it is hard, but definitely possible.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been doing this for years and I didnt know it&rsquo;s a thing. I just starve myself every day coz I&rsquo;m too lazy to cook or even chop fruits or veggies. My stomach cant take fast food or anything processed unless I eat healthy food first. Now I&rsquo;m 33 with 3 kids and everyone thinks I&rsquo;m 23. Maybe it&rsquo;s the fasting.</li>
<li>I‚Äôve tried intermittent fasting in December and was able to loose 2.5kg in more or less 10days. I‚Äôve started again a month ago but I literally lost nothing at all. I this think also stress level plays a really big role.</li>
<li>Have been doing intermittent fasting for about 50 days, i lost about 10lbs</li>
<li></li>
<li>I also recommend using an app. I use the app zero and it helped me maintain and see my progressüòä</li>
<li>May I do this fasting forever? I mean became my habit</li>
<li>Being quarantined I&rsquo;ve deeply changed my habits, sleeping usually from 2 am to 10 am, having breakfast at 10.30 am, lunch at 2 pm and a snack at 6 pm before working out from 7 to 8.30 pm. After that I take a shower and basically I don&rsquo;t feel like having dinner at 10 pm, so I just started skipping it. After almost 1 month I&rsquo;ve lost more than 3 kg. Now I realise I&rsquo;m doing intermittent fasting! I feel great and you must know it usually  took me around 2 months of dieting to lose this much weight in the past.</li>
