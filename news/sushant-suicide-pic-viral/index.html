<p>While Sushant’s body has been sent for postmortem, police has contemplated suicide. The shocked and heartbroken fans took to Twitter to quote Sushant’s character Anni’s dialogue from his super-hit film Chhichhore. Ironically, Sushant essayed the role of a father who helps his son beat depression after the latter attempts suicide under the pressure of pursuing engineering.

<p>The worst thing apart from being ignorant about mental health is attaching a why to the state of depression when one is loaded with “success”. Let’s start taking mental health seriously. It’s high time.</p>
<p>May Sushant’s soul rest in peace.

<p><img src="https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1-39.jpg" alt="img">
Today, June 14 Bollywood woke up to the heartbreaking news of Sushant Singh Rajput committing suicide in his Bandra residence where he was found hanging by his house help who later informed the police. Amid the current situation when the country is crippling with coronavirus pandemic, this news is making people hate the year 2020 even more. While the exact cause of him committing suicide is not known, people cannot stop talking about mental health and depression. #MentalHealthMatters is trending all over Twitter with people discussing how important it is to talk to each other and not let difficult times take away the best of you.</p>
<p>People are remembering quotes and dialogues from his last movie Chhichore, which was ironically about his Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s character encouraging his son to fight suicidal thought and teaching him how to accept failure. Netizens are urging, anyone who is dealing with suicidal thoughts, depressive feelings or anxiety must reach out to their loved ones. People must vent out their feelings to not be pushed towards something as scary as suicide. Take a look at some of the #MentalHealthMatters tweets:</p>
<p>If you are feeling stressed, talk to someone. If you are feeling anxious, talk to someone. If you feel like you have symptoms of depression, please talk to someone. Prioritise yourself. Prioritise your mental health.#MentalHealth #MentalHealthMatters — Harsh Mariwala (@hcmariwala) June 14, 2020</p>

We don’t talk about failures, we don’t talk about others feeling. Break the stigma. #depression #MentalHealthMatters pic.twitter.com/HMLh2tTj0f — Anant Chandra (@AnantChandra_) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>While the current situations may seem gloomy it is important to remember Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s famous dialogue from his last movie Chhichore, &ldquo;Tumhara Result Decide Nahi Karta Hai Ki Tum Loser Ho Ki Nahi &hellip; Tumhari Koshish Decide Karti Hai&rdquo;. Another one of his dialogues from Chhichore that can be used as life quote is &ldquo;Success Ke Baad Ka Plan Sabke Paas Hai &hellip; Lekin Agar Galti Se Fail Ho Gaye &hellip; Toh Failure Se Kaise Deal Karna Hai &hellip; Iski Koi Baat Hi Nahi Karna Chahta.&rdquo;</p>

Sushant Singh slams spiritual leader Sadhguru</p>
<p>Ex Savdhaan India host Sushant Singh, who has been on the forefront of anti-CAA protest, has slammed spiritual leader, Sadhguru. The actor took to Twitter to question Sadhguru for using his photograph for an upcoming programme in Mumbai without his permission. Sushant, who attended one of his spiritual programmes mentioned it to be &lsquo;worst experience&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Disillusioned Sushant tweeted, &lsquo;&lsquo;Dear@SadhguruJV did I give you permission to use my picture? Still, if you insist on using it, please also share it with the scathing feedback my wife and I gave your &lsquo;spiritual&rsquo; programme. Worst experience of our lives. Six sets of clothes you changed in two days, were fab though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dear ⁦⁦@SadhguruJV⁩ did I give u permission to use my pic?Still if u insist on using it, please also share it with the scathing feedback I and my wife gave to ur ‘spiritual’ program.Worst experience of r lives.6 sets of clothes u changed in 2 days, were fab though. pic.twitter.com/0kZYsh5oAi — सुशांत सिंह sushant singh سوشانت سنگھ (@sushant_says) January 15, 2020</p>
<p>However, this didn&rsquo;t go down well with Rangoli Chandel, who is a follower of Isha Foundation. In a tweet, Rangoli wrote that she doesn&rsquo;t know who he is and even the volunteers of the programme would have not known him.</p>
<p>In another tweet, she wrote, &lsquo;&lsquo;Pl note iss bande Sushant ke pass dsnt hv a single point against d program dat teaches meditation toh kapdon se problem tu wahan kapde dekh raha tha? Millions f people benefitin frm Isha meditations or yeh badnaseeb ko wahan bhi sukoon nahi mila,iska focus kapdo pe he tha&rsquo;'.</p>
<p>For the unversed, Sushant announced his exit from the popular crime show Savdhaan India on Twitter. In a cryptic response to a follower, the actor hinted that it may be because of his participation in Citizenship Amendment Act protests. However, the channel denied any sort of politics behind his removal.</p>
<p>And, my stint with Savdhaan India has ended. — सुशांत सिंह sushant singh سوشانت سنگھ (@sushant_says) December 16, 2019</p>
