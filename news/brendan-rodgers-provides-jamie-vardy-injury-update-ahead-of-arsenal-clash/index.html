<p>Last season’s top scorer has missed Leicester’s last two matches (Picture: Getty Images)</p>
<p>Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers is hopeful that Jamie Vardy will be available to take on Arsenal on Sunday but he will be subject to a late fitness test.</p>
<p>Last season’s Premier League top scorer has been out of action with a calf problem and missed both Monday night’s defeat to Aston Villa and Thursday’s Europa League triumph over Zorya Luhansk.</p>
<p>James Maddison, Harvey Barnes and Kelechi Iheanacho were all on the score sheet in a 3-0 win which Vardy watched from the stands.</p>

<p>Although he was not fit enough to play against the Ukrainian side, Rodgers is cautiously optimistic that Vardy could play some part at the Emirates on Sunday.</p>

<p>‘We’ll see how he is over the next couple of days and hopefully he can be available for the weekend,’ Rodgers told BT Sport after the game.</p>
<p>‘But we’ll see about that in the next 48 hours.</p>
<p>‘It’s important to get all the players back not just Jamie. We’ve got a number of players, very important players, that are out.</p>
<p>‘But at the front end of the pitch, of course, he offers a threat with his speed, his movement and how clinical he is.’</p>

<p>Vardy has an excellent record against Arsenal, scoring 10 goals in 11 Premier League games against the Gunners – though Leicester have only won three of those encounters.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old has continued this season how he finished the previous campaign, when he edged out Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to win the Golden Boot, scoring five goals in four games – a goal every 71 minutes.</p>
<p>Arsenal, meanwhile, enjoyed a profitable night themselves in the Europa League as they recorded a 2-1 victory away to Rapid Vienna.</p>

<p>Arsenal have been dealt a blow ahead of facing Leicester on Sunday after Brendan Rodgers’ latest injury update.</p>
<p>The Gunners will look to continue their winning momentum from the 2-1 Europa League win over Rapid Vienna.</p>
<p>It will see them host the Foxes, who join them on nine Premier League points but are one place ahead on goal difference.</p>
<p>The 2016 champions have reasons of their own for wanting a win, though, as they look to recover from defeats to West Ham and Aston Villa.</p>
<p>And they are set to welcome back last season’s Golden Boot-winner Jamie Vardy in a blow to Mikel Arteta’s side.</p>

<p>Speaking in the post-match interview, Rodgers said: “We’ll see how he is over the next couple of days and hopefully he can be available for the weekend.</p>
<p>“But we’ll see about that in the next 48 hours.</p>
<p>“It’s important to get all the players back not just Jamie. We’ve got a number of players, very important players, that are out.</p>
<p>“But at the front end of the pitch, of course, he offers a threat with his speed, his movement and how clinical he is.”</p>

<p>Vardy picked up a calf injury against Villa earlier this month, taking the Europa League win over Zorya Luhansk off for recovery.</p>
<p>And he has a great record against the Gunners, scoring 10 goals in 11 league games against the north London side.</p>
<p>But Arteta has a new player to get in the Englishman’s way after Thomas Partey made his first start in the win over Vienna.</p>

<p>And the manager confirmed that the Ghanaian will continue to have a major role in Arsenal’s plans.</p>
<p>He said: “He looked really solid, really comfortable,&rdquo; said the manager in his post-match press conference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He held midfield by himself in the second half when we were a little bit more open and starting to take more chances attacking certain places with some players.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was fantastic tonight and there&rsquo;s much more to come from him.&rdquo;

<h3 id="leicester-city-injury-news-latest-updates-on-jamie-vardy-caglar-soyuncu-and-ricardo-pereira-ahead-of-arsenal">&ldquo;Leicester City injury news: Latest updates on Jamie Vardy, Caglar Soyuncu and Ricardo Pereira ahead of Arsenal&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.inews.co.uk/content/uploads/2020/10/PRI_167396154.jpg" alt="img">
Leicester City injury news: Latest updates on Jamie Vardy, Caglar Soyuncu and Ricardo Pereira ahead of Arsenal Brendan Rodgers has concerns over a number of his key players for this weekend’s Premier League match at the Emirates</p>
<p>Brendan Rodgers has numerous injury concerns to contend with as he bids to reverse Leicester City‘s poor run of results against Arsenal on Sunday.</p>
<p>Leicester’s 5-2 thrashing of Manchester City at the Etihad feels like it occurred a lot longer than three weeks ago.</p>
<p>Rather than act as a springboard to bigger and better things, Leicester’s form has nosedived since after back-to-back home defeats to West Ham and Aston Villa.</p>
<p>Injuries to key players certainly hasn’t helped and Rodgers could face the prospect of picking a starting XI from a depleted squad again at the Emirates.</p>
<p>Leicester injury news</p>
<p>Jamie Vardy was absent for Leicester’s defeat to Aston Villa on Sunday due to a calf problem and Rodgers confirmed he would also miss the Europa League game against Zorya Luhansk on Thursday.</p>
<p>“Jamie is a huge miss for us,” Rodgers said. “We have to work with what we have, but we go into each game with confidence we can create and score goals and it’ll be no different tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The Foxes lacked firepower without their leading goalscorer at the weekend as neither Kelechi Iheanacho nor forgotten man Islam Slimani made much of an impact.</p>
<p>While Vardy is expected to return to action before long, defender Caglar Soyuncu faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines after suffering a torn adductor muscle.</p>

<p>“He’s gone to London to look at the extent of it and it’s a case of a decision between him and ourselves on whether it’s conservatively managed, or if he wants to have the operation,” Rodgers said.</p>
<p>“The medical team are in discussions with the player and trying to find the best solution and we’ll see where we go from there.”</p>
<p>Wilfred Ndidi has been ruled out since before the City game with an adductor issue on his own and the club has not delivered an update on his fitness.</p>
<p>Speaking last month, Rodgers claimed that the influential midfielder faces between “six and 12 weeks” out of action.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ricardo Pereira’s long-awaited return from an ACL injury sustained in Leicester’s 4-0 win over Aston Villa in March – the final Premier League game pre-lockdown – is edging closer.</p>
<p>The right-back told Portuguese news outlet O Jogo that he could be back playing before Christmas.</p>
<p>He was quoted as saying: “I begin working with the team in two weeks and from then on, I will need to gain the competitive pace and the necessary confidence. It will depend, but I believe within six weeks.”</p>
<p>Ghanaian midfielder Daniel Amartey is also unavailable with Rodgers explaining that his omission from Leicester’s Europa League squad was due to injury.</p>
<p>“He’s sustained a really bad hamstring injury which is such a shame because he’s worked so hard after a couple of years out, to get game-time and play so well against Manchester City and then to play against West Ham.”

Vardy scored five goals in the opening four games of the season, with four of those strikes coming from the penalty spot. Leicester looked toothless without him at the weekend and will be desperate to have him back in action for their visit to north London.

<p>Brendan Rodgers has not ruled Jamie Vardy out of playing some part in Leicester City&rsquo;s clash against Arsenal this weekend but will see how the striker fares over the next 48 hours.</p>
<p>The forward missed the 3-0 win over Zorya Luhansk on Thursday night because of a calf problem as he watched the Europa League win from the stands at the King Power.</p>
<p>Vardy now faces a race against time in a bid to be fit to face the Gunners with the injury disrupting what has been a terrific start to the season.</p>
<p>But speaking to BT Sport after the game, Rodgers says he will monitor the forward closely.</p>
<p>“We’ll see how he is over the next couple of days and hopefully he can be available for the weekend ,” he said.</p>
<p>“But we’ll see about that in the next 48 hours.</p>
<p>“It’s important to get all the players back not just Jamie. We’ve got a number of players, very important players, that are out.</p>
<p>“But at the front end of the pitch, of course, offers a threat with his speed, his movement and how clinical he is.”</p>
<p>Vardy&rsquo;s absence certainly did not prove a hindrance against Zorya as the Foxes got their European campaign off to the perfect start with an impressive performance.</p>
<p>James Maddison tapped-in midway through the first half, before an impudent finish from Harvey Barnes put the Foxes 2-0 up before the break.</p>
<p>Leicester looked a potent threat going forwards and it was left to Kelechi Iheanacho to wrap up the win after the break.</p>
<p>And Rodgers praised his players for adapting to a tactical switch in the second half.</p>

<p>“They play a 4-4-2 diamond and it’s a system you can have joy against with the spaces on the sides,” he said.</p>
<p>“But it’s also a system that can also hurt you with the numbers on the inside.</p>
<p>“We had joy going forwards, but when they had the ball at times they were a threat.</p>
<p>“In the second half, we looked to kill the game. We went to a 4-4-2 diamond ourselves and the players worked that very well.</p>
<p>“We were then able to create on top of that and took away their chances of coming back into the game.</p>
<p>“The players deserve a huge amount of credit for adapting to what I asked them to do and we kept a clean sheet.”

<h3 id="rodgers-reveals-extent-of-söyüncü--vardy-injuries">&ldquo;Rodgers Reveals Extent Of Söyüncü &amp; Vardy Injuries&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://resources.lcfc.com/leicesterfc/photo/2020/10/19/3d864860-4599-449b-b31a-fd4af7dffb8d/B45I6198.JPG" alt="img">
Manager Brendan Rodgers says defender Çağlar Söyüncü could be out for three months after picking up an injury while on international duty with Turkey, while Jamie Vardy will miss Thursday&rsquo;s UEFA Europa League fixture.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Çağlar Söyüncü could be out for three months with an adductor problem, says manager Brendan Rodgers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The central defender sustained the injury while away with Turkey during the international break</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rodgers is hopeful Jamie Vardy will be fit for Sunday’s Premier League trip to Arsenal</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Foxes No.4 missed Sunday’s Premier League encounter with Aston Villa due to an adductor injury, and after the match, Rodgers confirmed the extent of the issue.</p>
<p>He also commented on Vardy’s calf issue, which will likely see the striker miss Thursday’s UEFA Europa League Group G clash with FC Zorya Luhansk.</p>
<p>“Jamie will probably miss the European game and hopefully he’ll be okay for our next league game,” he said. “It’s just a reoccurrence of what he’s had over the last number of years, Jamie.</p>
<p>“Even before I came in, I’m led to believe he’s had some issues with his calves, that keep him out for a bit.</p>
<p>“This isn’t so serious, but it was one where playing him tonight would have risked a tear and we couldn’t afford to do that. We’re hopeful that he’ll be ready for our next league game.</p>
<p>“Söyüncü is more serious in terms of the muscle is right off the bone, so he could be up to three months, which is an absolute shame for him.</p>
<p>“He did it the day before training with the Turkish national team. So, he’ll be a big miss, and he adds to the other boys that are out.”
