<p>KARACHI: National icon Tariq Aziz has passed away. He was 84 years old. Pakistan’s first television anchor on and host of the popular show passed away in Lahore.</p>
<p>According to Tribune, Aziz was rushed to a private hospital where he passed away after a cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Aziz was well known for being a poet and also a politician later in his life when he became a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan between 1997 and 1999.</p>
<p>Celebrities have taken to Twitter to express their shock and sorrow:</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.greaterkashmir.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017_12largeimg220_dec_2017_194438143.jpg?fit=480%2C320&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Former actor Zaira Wasim’s post about floods and locust attacks was met with a huge backlash, forcing her to deactivate Twitter and Instagram accounts, but the “Dangal” star has now made a comeback on social media.</p>
<p>Zaira had caused a social media storm after she tweeted a verse from the Quran that many people said justifies the locust attacks in various states across the country.</p>
<p>“So We sent upon them the flood and locusts and lice and frogs and blood: Signs openly self-explained: but they were steeped in arrogance- a people given to sin -Qur’an 7:133 (sic),” Zaira had said in a now-deleted post.</p>
<p>The same post is, however, still visible on her Instagram page, where she had also shared a video.</p>
<p>Zaira was criticised by social media users for her insensitivity towards those affected by the locust attacks, which led her to deactivate both her Twitter and Instagram accounts.</p>
<p>But on Saturday, she resumed her accounts and in a post, explained why she had exited the social media platforms.</p>
<p>“Because I am just a human, like everyone else, who’s allowed to take a break from everything whenever the noise inside my head or around me reaches it peak,” Zaira, 19, said in response to a query by one of the users.</p>
<p>However, she has since deleted the new post.</p>
<p>Last year, the National Award-winning actor was in a centre of a debate after she announced her “disassociation” from acting, saying she was not happy with the line of work as it interfered with her faith and religion.</p>
<p>She had said that it felt like she had struggled to become someone else for a very long time.</p>
<p>The actor, who was in her early teens when she appeared in Dangal opposite Aamir Khan, also worked in his 2017 production venture Secret Superstar. Her last film was “The Sky Is Pink”, opposite Priyanka Chopra and Farhan Akhtar.

Fans of actor Ayeza Khan are in for a surprise as the Meray Paas Tum Ho star finally made an entry on Twitter.</p>
<p>In her first tweet, Ayeza said hello to her “Twitter fam”.</p>
<p>Asalamualikum and Hello Twitter Fam ❤️ — Ayezakhan.ak (@Ayezakhanak3) May 11, 2020</p>
<p>She clarified that the Twitter handle @Ayezakhan_ak was not hers but had been made by a fan.</p>
<p>The actor held a short #AskAyeza session on the microblogging platform. Fans asked her when she would co-star with actor Sami Khan again. Ayeza said that she was waiting for a good script.</p>
<p>A fan asked her if she would like to “pair up with Hamza Ali Abbasi again for a serial or movie” to which Khan said: “I wish we could make Pyaray Afzal 2”.</p>
<p>She told her fans that she hadn’t signed on any new projects due to the COVID-19 outbreak in the country.</p>
<p>The Meher Posh star is quite active on Instagram. She frequently treats fans with photos of her family and outfits of the day along with some healthy food posts.

<h3 id="accurate-representation-matters-the-importance-of-portraying-realistic-muslim-characters-on-tv">&ldquo;&lsquo;Accurate representation matters&rsquo;: the importance of portraying realistic Muslim characters on TV&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thenational.ae/image/policy:1.1016350:1588859976/image.jpg?f=16x9&amp;q=0.6&amp;w=1200&amp;$p$f$q$w=70c86c9" alt="img">
A short clip from an episode of Fox&rsquo;s television series 9-1-1: Lone Star all of a sudden resurfaced on Twitter this week.</p>
<p>The episode may have first been broadcast in January, but that certainly doesn&rsquo;t mean the issues it raises are no longer relevant.</p>
<p>The clip in question has drawn harsh criticism about the depiction of the show&rsquo;s Muslim character Marjan Marwani, a hijabi firefighter played by Natacha Karam.</p>
<p>The scene shows Marwani losing her hijab during a rescue mission, after which her male teammates run to &ldquo;form a wall&rdquo; around her as she tries to put her hijab back on.</p>
<p>Yukk! Cringeworthy!! Look at actor hiding her and closing his eyes as if she is changing her clothes not fixing hijab. Fit for a dumb Bollywood script I say! 🤮 #911LoneStar pic.twitter.com/TLKmImRkTD — Vikas Pandey (@MODIfiedVikas) May 6, 2020</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cringeworthy,&rdquo; wrote Twitter user Vikas Pandey in response. &ldquo;Look at [the] actor hiding her and closing his eyes as if she is changing her clothes, not fixing [her] hijab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some social media users, meanwhile, have criticised the actress&rsquo;s immaculately styled hair, arguing that few hijabi woman would have flowing locks like that if they were to lose their veil the way the character did.</p>
<p>Others slammed one male character&rsquo;s reaction upon seeing Marwani&rsquo;s hair for the first time, as he simply uttered &ldquo;wow&rdquo;. The list of critiques goes on as Twitter users tore the scene apart.</p>
<p>There’s this obsession in Western media that a woman’s Hijab comes off for some reason and that people around her realize how beautiful she is/her hair is. I AM SO TIRED OF IT. This was ridiculous #911lonestar https://t.co/sn3PJ4yDpN — silhan (@whitelily22) May 5, 2020</p>
<p>The conversation led other users to share a clip from a different scene that showed Marwani praying at the fire station, but in a manner that seemed inaccurate to the way Muslims typically prayed. As she kneels to the floor, her feet are to the side with arms on the floor during the sujood position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you make an effort to include a Muslim character but can&rsquo;t be bothered to search how Muslims pray,&rdquo; wrote Twitter user Ambereen Dadabhoy. &ldquo;Accurate representation matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When you make an effort to include a Muslim character but can’t be bothered to research how Muslims pray. Accurate representation matters ⁦⁩ ⁦@911LoneStar⁩ 🤦🏽‍♀️ pic.twitter.com/MjVEmB572r — Ambereen Dadabhoy (@DrDadabhoy) May 5, 2020</p>
<p>Dadabhoy makes a fair point. While 9-1-1: Lone Star&rsquo;s creators are to be applauded for including a Muslim character in a western show, the kind of inaccuracies that are overlooked do as much harm as the lack representation itself.</p>
<p>It makes viewers able to clock those misrepresentations of their faith lose their belief in the story and its credibility, even if it&rsquo;s a fictional television series.</p>
<p>Last month, Netflix released Unorthodox, a German-American drama series based on Deborah Feldman&rsquo;s 2012 autobiography Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots.</p>
<p>In a special episode titled The Making of Unorthodox, the creators of the show talked about the lengths they went to to make sure that their representation of the Satmar Hasidic community of Williamsburg, New York, was as accurate as could be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to go beyond cliche, beyond our projection on to what the life might be in a community like this,&rdquo; said the show&rsquo;s director, Maria Schrader. The creators also worked with specialists such as Eli Rosen, a cultural consultant who also acted in the show, to ensure the precisest, most accurate of details.</p>
<p>Regardless of what one might think of the show&rsquo;s story, the way they captured the authentic essence of that community deserves to be recognised.</p>
<p>However, 9-1-1 Lone Star isn&rsquo;t the first nor is it the only show to receive such criticism for its representation of Muslim female characters. The Bold Type, a show about three young women, has been criticised for the way its Muslim character Adena dressed in low-neck tops, for instance. This is something a hijabi Muslim woman wouldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>One of the more accurate representations of Muslims on the small screen is the successful Hulu show Ramy. Although it has had its share of criticism, it&rsquo;s far from a lazy representation. Another example is Sam Esmail&rsquo;s Mr. Robot with its Muslim character Shama Biswas.</p>
<p>The creators of 9-1-1: Lone Star still have an opportunity to make Marwani&rsquo;s character more believable with the renewal of a second season.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure if they put a Twitter call-out, thousands would be happy to offer advice on how to represent the demographic accurately.

<p><img src="https://www.globalvillagespace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rajan-Sharma-veteran-journalist-slammed-due-to-his-tweet.jpg" alt="img">
Sharma&rsquo;s Islamophobic hashtag on Twitter was followed by hatred comments from the netizens. Even another Indian journalist called him &lsquo;shameless&rsquo; due to the communal color he gave to the protest of the migrant workers outside the Bandra railway station.</p>
<p>Rajat Sharma, a veteran Indian Journalist and TV editor-in-chief, has been criticised upon his hatred tweets by the Muslim community in India amid coronavirus tensions. His tweet came days after the death of a Muslim man due to COVID-19 in Nagpur, India.</p>
<p>It clearly shows that the tweet was linked to the gathering of migrant workers in Mumbai’s Bandra recently. The tweet read, “Abdul Latif of Nagpur hid corona. After his death, it emerged that he had infected his sons, daughter-in-law, brother, sister-in-law, daughters, son-in-law, grandsons and the whole family.</p>
<p>As a nation we are failed now.</p>
<p>Look the language of tweet, criminals are criminals neither hindu nor muslim.@RajatSharmaLive ji please please stop this classification it is breaking us, our society, our image in world. https://t.co/v31pIqo5IF — Laughing Sardar (@LaughingSardaar) April 24, 2020</p>
<p>Even his friends, who met him unknowingly fell victims. In total, 55 positive cases have come and reports for 144 more are yet to come. People of Nagpur are surprised.”</p>
<p>“Your news and tweet show you must be seeing Muslims even your dream”: Rajat Sharma of India TV faces brutal social media trolling for his latest tweet on coronavirus victim https://t.co/IrQdTrWmyv pic.twitter.com/Rl1BQK4oiH — Guess what (@2GuessWhat4) April 24, 2020</p>
<p>Sharma’s Islamophobic tweet was instantly followed by a number of social media users. The response of the users to his tweet emphasised on the religious identity of the corona victim. As one person wrote, “Your news and tweet show that you must be seeing Muslims even your dream.”</p>
<p>Reaction after his Tweet:</p>
<p>Anti- Islamic hashtags on the microblogging website by the journalist posed a question on the religious identity of Suresh, a Dubai-returned man, who threw a feast of 1500 people in Madhya Pradesh whilst being positively diagnosed with the pandemic coronavirus. The whole Monera district was sealed by the authorities, where the ceremony took place.</p>

<p>Rajan Sharma had been slammed by the Muslims of India as he emphasized on ‘Jama Masjid’ in his tweet, which was followed by a protest outside Bandra’s railway station. The protest was flooded with the migrant workers and labourers. A veteran journalist Nikhil Wagle also passed aggressive remarks on Sharma’s tweet by calling him ‘shameless’ as he gave a communal color to the protest.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of coronavirus in India, the Muslim Community have been facing more difficulties. The gathering of Tableeghi Jamaat in India was accused as the event of virus spread. Many Muslims were stopped from selling things in the streets, virus-infected patients were banned from giving proper treatment in the hospitals.</p>

The gap between Hindu-Muslim community burgeoned when the government of India created a separate list of the virus carriers who participated in the Tablighi jamaat’s gathering. There has been a sudden surge in anti-muslim hashtags on social media platforms since the outbreak of the deadly disease which makes the situation even worst.

<p>New Delhi: Princess Hend Al Qassimi, a member of the royal family of United Arab Emirates, called out a series of “Islamophobic posts” on Twitter Thursday by a user named Saurabh Upadhyay.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Upadhyay had put out several tweets targeting Muslims over the March congregation of Tablighi Jamaat in New Delhi that led to a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in India.</p>
<p>A Twitter spat had soon ensued between Upadhyay and another user, during which the former allegedly used foul language. Claiming that the Tablighis spat on people, Upadhyay asked, “What’s with peaceful people and spitting? New form of jihad custom made for 2020?”</p>
<p>He also allegedly used abusive language against the Tablighis, calling them “radical Islamist terrorists”. Upadhyay later went on a say how Hindus were being targetled in the Middle East and that the region is what it is today “because Indians have built cities like Dubai from scratch”.</p>
<p>While Upadhyay seems to have deactivated or deleted his Twitter account, his posts led to a sharp response by Princess Qassimi who shared screenshots of the tweets and said anyone “openly racist and discriminatory in the UAE will be fined and made to leave”.</p>
<p>Anyone that is openly racist and discriminatory in the UAE will be fined and made to leave. An example; pic.twitter.com/nJW7XS5xGx — Princess Hend Al Qassimi (@LadyVelvet_HFQ) April 15, 2020</p>
<p>She also responded to some of Upadhyay’s earlier tweets, which along with all his other posts cannot be seen now as the account no longer exists. Qassimi said though the ruling family of UAE is “friends with Indians”, his rudeness was “not welcome”.</p>
<p>“All employees are paid to work, no one comes for free. You make your bread and butter from this land which you scorn and your ridicule will not go unnoticed,” she wrote.</p>
<p>The ruling family is friends with Indians, but as a royal your rudeness is not welcome. All employees are paid to work, no one comes for free.

<p>Previous ‘hate’ posts</p>
<p>Princess Qassimi’s response has been applauded by several users on Twitter. Some have even highlighted previous instances of ‘Islamophobia’ displayed made by Upadhyay on the micro-blogging site.</p>
<p>In one post allegedly by Upadhyay, he had said all Islamic organisations “should be kept on vigilant watch or barred” as they only spread violence and unrest.</p>
