<p>&ldquo;Parkland Rising,&rdquo; director Cheryl Horner McDonough&rsquo;s documentary about high school students organizing a national protest after a mass shooting at their high school, will show at the 2020 deadCenter Film Festival. [Photo provided]</p>
<p>The 20th Annual deadCenter Film Festival launches today, and it looks quite a bit different from any previous iteration of Oklahoma&rsquo;s largest film festival - and not just because it will boast the longest run and the largest number of films in its history.</p>
<p>As previously reported, deadCenter is going virtual this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the first time ever, deadCenter is going to be primarily an online event and we&rsquo;re making it twice as big and lasting twice as long to accommodate people from around the country. Because it&rsquo;s online we&rsquo;re going to be able to invite a lot broader range of people to participate in it,&rdquo; said deadCenter Film Executive Director Lance McDaniel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be different, but we&rsquo;re going to make it super fun just like we always do. And more importantly, we&rsquo;re going to highlight 140 awesome films that you wouldn&rsquo;t see otherwise from all these brilliant filmmakers.&rdquo;

Politics Insider for April 29: MPs navigated oh-so-many technical hiccups to do some democracy, Theresa Tam put out new pandemic projections and watch out for Nickelback</p>
<p>Welcome to a sneak peek of the Maclean’s Politics Insider newsletter. Sign up to get it delivered straight to your inbox.</p>
<p>Parliamentary pedants were rightfully annoyed by sloppy terminology emanating from the offices of the Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland. Both released itineraries that referred to yesterday’s meeting of the special committee on COVID-19 as a “virtual sitting of the House of Commons.” Of course, the committee being only a committee means yesterday was decidedly not a House sitting, even if hundreds of MPs joined.</p>
<p>And join they did, almost all of them.</p>
<p>The clunky committee proceedings, chaired by Speaker Anthony Rota, left MPs to figure out the everyday Canadian problems of figuring out Zoom and negotiating dreaded system updates. As Rota made opening remarks, Finance Minister Bill Morneau briefly popped up on camera. When Rota ceded the floor to Health Minister Patty Hajdu, a long delay ensued as she figured out how to unmute herself. Conservative MP Matt Jeneroux was interrupted briefly by some harmless chuckling from the mic of Treasury Board President Jean-Yves Duclos. The Bloc leader, Yves-François Blanchet, was momentarily distracted by his buzzing phone. Watch a full replay of all the antics.</p>
<p>A makeshift virtual question period proved to the country that Justin Trudeau and Andrew Scheer, sitting down and separated by the ether, can speak in their indoor voices—as if the explosive theatre offered by the physical House chamber is engineered for theatre’s sake.</p>
<p>Today, the Commons will meet in-person, in reduced numbers, to debate a student aid bill—but only after another in-the-flesh meeting, featuring the same MPs, of the special committee. Eventually the hope is to convene a full virtual Parliament, and a Commons committee is furiously hashing out how to make that work. Thus concludes this morning’s lesson in pandemic-era civics.</p>
<p>As the House worked out the technical kinks, Theresa Tam gave the country the Public Health Agency of Canada’s newest modelling on coronavirus’s spread across Canada (check out the slides). The documents revealed a remarkable statistic: 2,012 of 2,561 deaths, as of April 26, were linked to long-term care and seniors’ homes. Patricia Treble, writing in Maclean’s, breaks down all the projections. Later on, the PM posted a series of federal-provincial shared guidelines on how to re-open the economy.</p>
<p>In his morning presser outside Rideau Cottage, Trudeau thanked Canadians for kind messages about his mother, Margaret, who was in hospital after a fire in her Montreal apartment building—but was “doing just fine.” The PM also thanked first responders in Fort McMurray, Alta., where floods have wreaked havoc. Read Trudeau’s full remarks.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary Budget Office yesterday published its latest number-crunching on the cost of COVID-19 emergency spending. The PBO calculated the cost to the federal treasury of paying an estimated 10,000 Canadian Armed Forces reservists to be ready to fight floods and forest fires this summer. Now you can add $456 million in unforeseen spending—a relative pittance!—to the overall federal pandemic response.</p>
<p>If you’ve filed a federal access-to-information request since March, you might have been told to expect long delays as work-from-home culture slows down the work of the bureaucrats whose job is to get you what you need. Now, Information Commissioner Caroline Maynard has sounded the alarm, cautioning in a new letter to cabinet the whole system is “in a critical phase and may soon be beyond repair if certain ongoing and developing issues remain unaddressed.”</p>
<p>Conservative Sen. Don Plett published a scathing press release in response to an announced ratification date for the new NAFTA of July 1. Plett says Tories only agreed to fast-track the trade deal’s legislation, Bill C-4, if all three countries ratified on Aug. 1. Dairy farmers had asked for that date because it lines up with their fiscal calendar—and, the industry said, could save millions of dollars. The Americans wanted to ratify on June 1. In the end, the three sides met in the middle. Plett called that compromise a “serious breach of trust.” Meanwhile, the Canadian Press has federal sources saying the government never guaranteed an August ratification.</p>
<p>An Ottawa city councillor says Nickelback, the band you definitely love or hate (or maybe pretend to hate but secretly love), is the cure to what ails lonely neighbours in his city. Tim Tierney, following the lead of the city’s stridently pro-Nickelback public health office, hopes mayor Jim Watson will support a motion that the mega-band’s hits be “played and sung in/on driveways and properties across Ottawa.” Tierney tweets #RespectTheBack. Locals might counter with #TooBad.

<h3 id="ysl-beauté-celebrates-new-fragrance-with-make-it-yours-pop-up-at-king-power-srivaree-store---the-moodie-davitt-report">&ldquo;YSL Beauté celebrates new fragrance with ‘Make it Yours’ pop-up at King Power Srivaree store - The Moodie Davitt Report&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.moodiedavittreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ysl-mon-paris-floral-still-life-19_sp_210x297-rvb-4-212x300.jpg" alt="img">
THAILAND. Personalising the beauty journey. That was the central concept as Yves Saint Laurent Beauté Travel Retail Asia Pacific last month ran a ‘Make it Yours’ pop-up at the King Power Downtown Srivaree Complex in Bangkok to promote the brand’s new fragrance, Mon Paris Parfum Floral.</p>
<p>The pop-up ran throughout June and was part of a larger pop-up strategy that included last month’s ‘Make it Yours’ pop-up with China Duty Free Group at Haitang Bay.</p>
<p>Travelling customers started their ‘personalised beauty journey’ by selecting a fragrance and then customising the bottle with an engraving, before finally choosing a personalised gift box. Yves Saint Laurent Beauté’s Rouge Pur Couture lipstick collection was also available to purchase in the pop-up boutique.</p>
<p>The brand owner said the pop-up took travellers on a “romantic journey” that highlighted the chypre and white peony elements of the Mon Paris Parfum Floral perfume.</p>
<p>Yves Saint Laurent Beauté General Manager Emily Coleman described the pop-up as “an engaging and memorable experience relevant to every travelling customer.” She added: “The ‘Make it Yours’ pop-up perfectly reflects our ambition to connect travellers all over the world with Yves Saint Laurent Beauté, and reinforce our position as a loved brand.”</p>
<p>King Power Thailand Senior Executive Vice President Susan Whelan said the pop-ups “spectacular retail design is sure to be a hit with customers.” She added, “We are delighted to partner with Yves Saint Laurent Beauté to celebrate the anniversary of the Make it Yours pop-up at Kingpower Downtown Srivaree Complex in Bangkok.”</p>
<p>“This spectacular retail design is sure to be a hit with customers.” – King Power Thailand Senior Executive Vice President S usan Whelan</p>
<p>Mon Paris Parfum Floral was created by perfumers Dora Baghriche and Olivier Cresp, who have previously collaborated on the Mon Paris fragrance series for YSL Beauté.</p>
<p>The new scent features zesty top notes of bergamot essence, flesh of pears, raspberries, and peach pulp. This is balanced by heart notes of datura flower, jasmine sambac, orange flower, magnolia essence, and peony accord; and is finished off with base notes of patchouli essence and musk. The new bottle design was inspired by the ornamental style of YSL couture and comes in a luminous pale pink shade with a blush Cassandra logo and crystal pearl encrusted black ribbon.

<h3 id="french-cinema-interview-with-actor-daniel-auteuil">&ldquo;French Cinema: Interview with Actor Daniel Auteuil&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.francetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/%C2%A9-2019-LES-FILMS-DU-KIOSQUE-PATHE%CC%81-FILMS-ORANGE-STUDIO-min.jpg" alt="img">
The French legend opens up about the beauty of being ugly and tells Lise Pedersen how his career has always been guided by joy</p>
<p>“Something had to go wrong. Everything is so perfect at this festival, I am delighted to be the first mistake,” quips Daniel Auteuil as sound and image fail to synchronise on the opening film of his masterclass at the Lumière film festival in Lyon. Exuding charm, charisma and comical self-deprecation, the 69-year-old actor/director is on form as guest of honour at the 11th edition of the festival, which celebrates film classics from around the world in the city where the cinematograph was invented.</p>
<p>A legend in France, with more than 60 films to his name, Auteuil has always shared his time between the screen and the stage. He was born in January 1950 into a family of artists in what was then French Algeria, where his opera-singing parents were on tour with their opérette show. “I was in my baby basket backstage. I grew up bathed in song and music. Every time they needed a child on stage, they used me,” he smiles.</p>
<p>“I was born in the theatre. And I’ve always felt very comfortable on stage. The way I see it, nothing bad can happen to me there since everything is planned!” he laughs. “I never made career choices; my choices were guided by pleasure. I made all my films with the same energy and the same joy. I was lucky enough to be successful early on; that helps you to relax and to open up to others.”</p>
<p>So how does he feel today about the film that made him a household name in France, Claude Zidi’s 1980 cult comedy Les Sous-doués? “I stand by all my films, including that one. It made me famous; it’s lived on through generations; it’s thanks to this collective memory that I am still here.”</p>
<p>Best Actor</p>
<p>Six years later, he took on the role which changed his life forever, playing Provençal peasant Ugolin in Claude Berri’s adaptation of Marcel Pagnol’s Jean de Florette (1986). It earned him a Best Actor accolade at the César awards, and was followed by the equally popular follow-up, Manon des Sources, the same year.</p>
<p>“It nearly didn’t happen,” explains an amused Auteuil. “Berri said to me, ‘You’re too handsome for the part.’ It was the first time anyone had told me that! So I shaved my head and went to see the make-up artist, and when we did the screen test Claude seemed satisfied. He said to me, ‘If you’re as good an actor as you are ugly, the role is yours!”</p>
<p>It was a 10-month odyssey that holds a special place in Auteuil’s heart. “It was a wonderful period in my life. I met the mother (Emmanuelle Béart) of my daughter, Nelly; I played alongside the great Yves Montand and Gérard Depardieu; and I made friends for life.”</p>
<p>Over the course of his career, Daniel Auteuil has worked with the greatest, including André Téchiné, Agnès Varda, Michael Haneke and Claude Sautet, with whom he made Quelques jours avec moi (1988) and Un coeur en hiver (1992). “I developed a true backbone thanks to him [Sautet]. He taught me rigour; simplicity. I don’t have to think when I’m acting. I choose the people I work with and I trust them.”</p>
<p>La Belle Époque</p>
<p>It is an instinct he has followed to this day: his latest film, romantic comedy La Belle Époque, co-starring Fanny Ardant, Guillaume Canet and Pierre Arditi, is the brainchild of up-and-coming director Nicolas Bedos, who sought out Auteuil for the lead role. He plays a cartoonist in his 60s who travels back in time through a historic re-enactment service to the day he met his now-estranged wife (Ardant). The film received a warm welcome at its premiere at the Festival Lumière.</p>
<p>“Bedos has a true writing talent and has proven to be a great director. This film marks the birth of a great filmmaker,” says Auteuil.</p>
<p>Asked about his own directing ambitions, Auteuil says he still plans on shooting the third part of his Pagnol trilogy, César, following the release of Fanny and Marius in 2013. For now, he is busy, as he always is, starring in a series for France 2, which will be followed by a feature-length fiction with Gilles Lellouche in early 2020.</p>

<h3 id="you-can-buy-a-piece-of-grimes-soul-for-10million">&ldquo;You can buy a piece of Grimes’ soul for $10million&rdquo;</h3>

You can buy a piece of Grimes’ soul for $10million</p>
<p>By Sophie Thompson</p>
<p>Grimes has announced that she&rsquo;ll be selling a piece of her soul for $10million as part of an art show she&rsquo;s working on.</p>
<p>Thinking of your next impulse lockdown purchase? Well, a piece of singer Grimes&rsquo; soul could be about to become yours, for a very reasonable price of $10million.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve a feeling she&rsquo;ll regret this one.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old, who recently gave birth to baby X Æ A-12, has announced that as part of an online art exhibition, she&rsquo;ll be drafting an agreement with a lawyer to give one lucky buyer a chance to legally own a &lsquo;little piece of her soul&rsquo;. We&rsquo;re not sure how much &lsquo;little&rsquo; is exactly.</p>
<p>READ MORE: Grimes claims she had part of her eyeball removed and the memes are incredible</p>
<p>Grimes will be handing over her soul to the buyer in a legal document. Picture: Robyn Beck/Cassy Athena</p>
<p>In a recent interview with Bloomberg, she revealed that she debuted her first online art show, Selling Out, which features photography, drawings, prints, and conceptual pieces made over the last 10 years, a lot of which is heavily inspired by her album covers and will be familiar to fans, using her signature dystopian style.</p>
<p>It will take place online over on Gallery Platform Los Angeles (May 28-June 3) and Maccarone Los Angeles (May 28-August 31), and one particularly interesting piece from the collection will be available as “a legal document whereby the purchaser acquires a percentage of Grimes’s soul”.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re confused too.</p>
<p>Speaking of the decision to give up a piece of her soul (in the form of a piece of paper), Grimes said, &ldquo;The deeper [my atorney and I] got with it, the more philosophically interesting it became [&hellip;] Also, I really wanted to collaborate with my lawyer on art. The idea of fantastical art in the form of legal documents just seems very intriguing to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although listed for $10million, the singer has now decided to leave the piece open to a &lsquo;best offer&rsquo; - so the public get to ultimately decide her worth.</p>
<p>Boasting of the venture, one of the art galleries helping her flog her soul, Maccarone Los Angeles, added that: &ldquo;Selling Out is executed as a contract in which Grimes sells a fraction of her soul, formalising the idea that every time an artist sells a piece of their art, part of the soul is sold with it. The purchaser will enter into a contractual agreement that outlines the terms of ownership and ultimately the connection to the joy of artistic expression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anyone got $10million lying around?</p>
<p>While Elon Musk may be one of the few lucky enough to be the purchaser, we can imagine the price isn&rsquo;t too much for two people who just made history by giving their baby an illegal name. X Æ A-12, you&rsquo;ve got a nice crib coming when this sale goes through.

NEW YORK — Ronna Glickman, a 50s-and-fabulous Jewish mother from Marblehead, Massachusetts, is a geyser of good advice. On “Ask Ronna with Ronna (&amp; Bryan),” she weighs in on conundrums shared by listeners via phone and email along with her sidekick, the considerably younger but sharp-beyond-his-years Bryan Safi.</p>
<p>Glickman’s New England-Jewish accent is considerably different from the New York/New Jersey tones I associate with my mother, my aunt, and their circle of Stella D’oro Breakfast Treats-munching friends who held court from the kitchen.</p>
<p>But her from-the-hip, impervious-to-BS voice is fundamentally the same. The lilt, cadence and frankness is one I associate with truth and comfort and, ultimately, love, even if what they have to say is not necessarily what I want to hear.</p>

<p>Safi, though a fundamentally positive person, is brined in the world-weary sarcasm commonly found in hilarious and secure gay men. As one drawn to “the arty kids” in school, I find his banter with Ronna another source of relaxation, nostalgia, comfort.</p>
<p>The most recent episode is a special done in conjunction with the 92nd Street Y, the great Jewish outpost of culture on Manhattan’s Upper East Side (and, like the rest of New York, closed in all non-virtual ways during the coronavirus pandemic). The guest was actor Nick Kroll, perhaps their biggest “get” yet. Previous guests are all big names in the world of comedy, which is where Bryan and Ronna have their roots.</p>
<p>Now’s as good a time as any to let you know that, yes, Ronna Glickman is an act, and the woman behind it is a younger woman named Jessica Chaffin. But who is to say what’s real and what isn’t? After five minutes listening to Jessica-as-Ronna, the concept of artifice and character becomes incredibly uninteresting. Ronna Glickman is as real as you need her to be, and she’s tender, perceptive and a scream.</p>
<p>When I spoke to Ronna (&amp; Bryan) over Zoom, I never for a minute felt I was speaking to anyone other than the voices you hear on their podcast. And as soon as she learned my name, Ronna reminded me she also had a son called Jordan (pronounced Jaw-den.) As if I didn’t already know.</p>
<p>I must also point out that we spoke prior to the death of George Floyd and subsequent protests seen throughout the United States. In a follow-up email exchange Ronna wrote that she was thinking of Martin Niemoller’s poem “They Came For Me.”</p>
<p>“In this case, most of us are the neighbor,” she said. “And we have a responsibility to the struggle of our friends, colleagues, lovers, and even strangers in our communities in their fight for equality, against racism, and to not be treated as ‘other.’ Call! Write! March! Donate! Vote! But, most importantly, you have to care. As a Jew, I feel an extra burden. It’s our turn to not close our eyes, and to help. Then, recharge. Take a breath. Take a walk. And prepare to fight again.”</p>
<p>Below is a truncated and edited transcript of our conversation, which I hope reads as funny as it would sound. So much of what makes Ronna (&amp; Bryan) is their speaking manner and their timing. Which is why you really ought to find their show wherever you listen to podcasts and check them out.</p>
<p>The Times of Israel: How should a newcomer start listening to your show?</p>
<p>Ronna: Look at the list of guests and if you see someone you are interested in, start there.</p>
<p>What if I am not interested in any of them?</p>
<p>Bryan: Pfffft!</p>
<p>Ronna: Well, I know you are interested in Bryan and me, so you can just do the old map trick, close your eyes and just point.</p>
<p>You’ve had no trouble finding great guests.</p>
<p>Ronna: We loved having Robin Lord Taylor on.</p>
<p>Bryan: Loved him. And Paul F. Tompkins.</p>
<p>Ronna: Sure, and his lovely wife Janie. And Ben Feldman and Paget Brewster. Carl Tart is fabulous. What’s great is it’s a different way to show off your perspective. You know, you ask someone to be on your show they think “Ach, am I gonna have to perform? Tell the same stories?” But everybody thinks they give good advice. It’s a great way to get to know the guests, to ask “how would you deal with this?”</p>
<p>I’ve listened to the two of you now a bit and I find you both sagacious and wise. What happens if one of your esteemed guests says something you think is crap advice?</p>
<p>Bryan: Wait, first, the fact you called me sagacious? And wise? And put me in the same category as Ronna? I’m putting that on my tombstone.</p>
<p>Ronna: We don’t know if he’s just being polite, though.</p>
<p>Bryan: That’s true.</p>
<p>Ronna: But to answer your question: we tell them! We tell them when they’re not right! It’s our show! But there’s always value in any answer, even if you don’t agree. It’s a very Jewish thing. Questions and answers to get to the bottom of something.</p>
<p>Ronna, when did you know that you were always right?</p>
<p>Ronna: Honestly, I’ve never not known. Everyone has a talent. Mine is being right. Or, maybe, I don’t know if I’m always right, but I’m not wrong.</p>
<p>It’s a key distinction.</p>
<p>Ronna: People can’t always receive information from the people in their lives. So Bryan and I are a conduit for them. It’s the right words, wrong face. You wanna know what we think, we’ll tell you. We’re kind, but don’t sugarcoat it. We’re considerate to those who are vulnerable with us, but if you came to us for an answer, we’re gonna give it to you.</p>
<p>Bryan: A lot of times people know what they need to be doing, and just need to hear it. Or else they are crossing their fingers to hear something different.</p>
<p>Ronna: It’s hard to get advice from people in your life sometimes. You may have exhausted avenues with a problem; you’ve talked to all your friends a thousand times about this guy you know you should break up with. But you maybe want a fresh set of eyes on the same problem. Also: it’s hard to be vulnerable with the people you’re closest to. I know that sounds like an oxymoron, but you don’t always want to lean on the people that you’re intimate with for these kinds of things. When you’re in a relationship, a person can’t be all things to their partner. We all end up bottling things up.</p>
<p>Bryan: And what’s key about asking Ronna — and Ronna, please don’t take offense to this —</p>
<p>Ronna: I’m sure I will —</p>
<p>Bryan: You really want to know what your mother thinks, but you don’t want to hear it from your mother.</p>
<p>Ronna: “I’d love my mother’s advice, but I don’t want her in my business.”</p>
<p>You mention people who have good relationships, but still there are things that are hard to bring up —</p>
<p>Ronna: You don’t want to rock the boat!</p>
<p>But is this universal? Are there some relationships that last that do have total, 100 percent communication?</p>
<p>Bryan: You’d become psychotic. It would become “Ugh, I hate what you are wearing, ugh, don’t look at me like that, ugh, you are an animal!” You have to keep something inside. The only people who express what they are feeling at all time are toddlers, and who wants to deal with that if they’re not yours?</p>
<p>Ronna: If those people do exist, I wouldn’t want to have dinner with them. And listen: it’s not great to always be in touch with your feelings at all times. You have to get your work done. You have to think about the people around you. And you have to consider your environment and physical indicators. Like, don’t ever have an argument when you’re hungry.</p>
<p>Ronna, I gotta say something — you have such a fabulous design sense — is that a zebra print you are wearing?</p>
<p>Ronna: This is, um, white tiger.</p>
<p>Are you into animal prints as a rule?</p>
<p>Ronna: I love animal prints, but it has to be the right one.</p>
<p>What are the wrong ones?</p>
<p>Ronna: You know it when you see it. Like Malcolm Gladwell’s “Blink.” I know an Yves Saint Laurent leopard print from 20 feet away.</p>
<p>Oh, so you mean the designer, not the animal itself.</p>
<p>Ronna: What, are you asking would I wear a hippo print? No, that’s not interesting to me. It’s the fabric, and the print itself. I love a Scalamandré tiger print for a sofa.</p>
<p>Bryan: Who makes what you are wearing now?</p>
<p>Ronna: Bryan, I’m not going to tell you. Because you get so upset when you hear how much I spend on clothes.</p>
<p>Bryan: Because I want you to spend that on me.</p>
<p>Ronna: You’re not my son, Bryan!</p>
<p>How have you been staying sane during the quarantine?</p>
<p>Ronna: We’ve raised a lot of money through the podcast, and donated to Meals on Wheels and World Central Kitchen. But it has been very hard on me not to travel. It connects me to humanity and beauty; I feel a little fenced in. But we’ve been doing a book club on the podcast and an international film festival. We’ve had a good selection.</p>
<p>What did you watch?</p>
<p>Ronna: We did “Honeyland” —</p>
<p>Bryan: Paired with “First Wives Club.”</p>
<p>Wait, what’s the connection?</p>
<p>Ronna: Women doing it for themselves!</p>
<p>Ah, the Queen Bee.</p>
<p>Ronna: More or less, sure.</p>
<p>Bryan: We did a British week, Spanish, Italian.</p>
<p>Ronna: “Room with a View” for Italian week.</p>
<p>Bryan: With “Talented Mr. Ripley.”</p>
<p>Ronna: Spain we did “Sexy Beast,” which you have to see. But I’ve been thinking a lot about Israel! I actually said this with Nick Kroll, that quarantine reminds me of visiting Israel on Shabbat. If there’s been any benefit, it’s taking a break to be with your family, to cook your own food; everything closes except what’s essential, and everyone is forced to slow down. But the beach is always open. I love that [on Shabbat in Israel]. I feel the people of Israel are maybe uniquely equipped to handle of this? I love to arrive on a Thursday in Israel to ease into Shabbat on a Friday. And hopefully someone invites you for dinner.</p>
<p>So have you thought of a Jewish-themed film night?</p>
<p>Ronna: I’ve been watching “Fauda” and of course everyone is talking about “Unorthodox” but I only watched two episodes. I found it screwy. She goes from being the most sheltered person in the world to making decisions where it’s “Oh, okay, you’re gonna go home with a guy you met in a coffee shop? Really? From having never been on a plane to that? Okay.” Then everyone keeps bringing up the Holocaust. Which, just so you know, is how all of my conversations go. But secular 20-year-olds don’t normally go around talking like this.</p>
<p>You don’t talk down to your audience. I listened to the first episode and you make a reference to “Chang and Eng,” who are maybe not household names to the youth of today.</p>
<p>Ronna: Listen, if you know, you know. Educated and curious people, which is what our audience is, they know things. We have a real relationship with our audience — they write to us about the most intimate details. They like that Bryan and I are interested and vocal people; Bryan reads everything. Even if they are only 16 years old, they are doing the same thing. And anyone who doesn’t know who Chang and Eng are is missing out!</p>
<p>Bryan: That’s our barometer. That’s our entry point: Chang and Eng.</p>
<p>Ronna: That was a dapper set of Siamese twins.</p>
<p>Bryan: They were.</p>
<p>Ronna: They put themselves together beautifully. Listen, if I were a Siamese twin I’d probably just take a sheet and throw it over both of us and say “why bother?”</p>
<p>Bryan: You’re supposed to say “conjoined,” Ronna, you don’t understand Gen Z.</p>
<p>Ronna: Conjoined, conjoined.</p>
<p>It’s the intent, with these terms. If you mean it maliciously —</p>
<p>Bryan [joking]: Well I do mean it maliciously.</p>
<p>Ronna: I mean it dismissively. So what Israeli movies should we watch for our film festival?</p>
<p>Well, one that kicked off a recent wave is an animated documentary called “Waltz With Bashir.”</p>
<p>Bryan: I heard of that, it was nominated for an Academy Award, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and recently there was a remastering of an older film from the late 1960s, very sleek and stylized called “Matzor,” about the young wife of a man killed in combat, very evocatively shot in black and white.</p>
<p>Ronna: And then we can watch “Shoah.”</p>
<p>Well, that’s always a barrel of laughs.</p>
<p>Ronna: I’m a big fan. It’s important to watch it again as a grown-up. It’s very easy to watch when you are young and say “I’d do this, I wouldn’t do that, how could they do this?” When you get older it brings a different perspective to the choices people make. But it’s hard to watch.</p>
<p>I wrote about just that when I rewatched “Schindler’s List” for the anniversary release.</p>
<p>Ronna [fanning herself]: Ralph Fiennes in “Schindler’s List,” don’t get me started.</p>
<p>He’s a handsome Nazi.</p>
<p>Ronna: Handsome? He gained all that weight, didn’t make a difference to me. The scene with the housekeeper? When he says “you almost talked me into it?” He definitely talked me into it.</p>
<p>This is maybe not the best way to ingratiate yourself to a Jewish readership, Ronna.</p>
<p>Ronna: What can I do? What? Look, should I be dishonest? The uniforms were impressive. Okay, let’s move on.</p>
<p>You say where you live, Marblehead, Massachusetts, has a great Jewish community, but I wasn’t sure if you were kidding.</p>
<p>Ronna: Yes, there’s a Temple here called Temple Shirat Hayam. We’ve got an old colonial look, but there is a thriving Jewish community. People try to equate New York and Boston Jews, but near Boston the community is smaller, so they assimilated faster. So there’s a kind of hybrid WASP-y Jew. But there are a few characters who are living their best lives and stating their opinions.</p>
<p>Another question: there’s a woman in your life named Jessica Chaffin.</p>
<p>Ronna: I’ve seen her in this and that.</p>
<p>Bryan: I love her.</p>
<p>How would you describe her method of creating a character?</p>
<p>Bryan: I didn’t know she did that.</p>
<p>Well, she’s an actress.</p>
<p>Ronna: Is she really an actress or is she just someone who delivers a line? Some people are actors, others are personalities. She’s all right. She’s cute.</p>
<p>Bryan: Well, I adore her.</p>
<p>Would Ronna and Jessica be friends?</p>
<p>Ronna: I think Jessica and I could be friends. Like Bryan, she’s a little bit younger, so she’d keep me connected to the world. Jessica is smart, she has chutzpah, and she takes very good care of her skin, but, to be honest, I think she could be a little more put together. But I would enjoy to have dinner with her.</p>
<p>New episodes of “Ask Ronna with Ronna (&amp; Bryan)” launch every Tuesday on Apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts.

<h3 id="can-you-get-covid-19-through-the-ventilation-in-your-home">&ldquo;Can you get COVID-19 through the ventilation in your home?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4947104.1590005272!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg" alt="img">
TORONTO &ndash; More than four and a half months after doctors in Wuhan reported patients with mysterious cases of pneumonia, there is still a great deal that remains unknown about SARS-CoV-2, even as scientists, researchers and doctors around the world scramble to learn as much as they can about the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>Whether someone can contract the virus through the air is one question that keeps cropping up, especially among those living in multi-unit dwellings concerned about the possibility of getting sick through shared air ducts and ventilation systems.</p>
<p>“What we’re seeing right now is this virus is probably not spread through the air as a main route of transmission,” said Dr. Yves Longtin, who chairs the infection prevention and control unit at Jewish General Hospital in Montreal.</p>
<p>If airborne transmission does exist, it is likely a secondary or tertiary method, he said in an interview with CTVNews.ca, and very minor compared to the main mode of transmission: contact with droplets from an infected individual.</p>
<p>Still, there is enough uncertainty that some scientists are not ruling out the possibility entirely and suggest taking simple precautionary measures.</p>
<p>“I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s too serious an issue, but I think it brings up the importance of trying to be as proactive as possible,” infectious disease specialist at Toronto Western Hospital, Dr. Abdu Sharkawy, told CTV News’ Chief Anchor and Senior Editor Lisa LaFlamme last month.</p>
<p>“I would say that if the ventilation system is one in a high-rise apartment, for example, that it is unlikely that someone on the top floor will come in contact with the same virus that went through the ventilation system on the bottom floor. However, if it&rsquo;s a smaller shared dwelling, there is the possibility it could run through the ventilation system.”</p>
<p>Despite how quickly information and knowledge on the virus can evolve in this pandemic, Sharkawy, an assistant professor of medicine with the University Health Network, still maintains that view.</p>
<p>“It’s always a good idea to open windows to optimize air flow and reduce the risk of a virus being confined to an indoor space,” he added in an email to CTVNews.ca on Tuesday.</p>
<p>There is no concrete evidence so far that someone can be infected through contaminated indoor air travelling over a great distance or through indoor vents, but there are at least indications that the virus can be found in the air somehow.</p>
<p>“To my knowledge, there is no evidence supporting the transmission of COVID-19 through ventilation systems … although researchers are still exploring the possibility,” said Bin Zhao, an expert on ventilation and a professor in the Department of Building Science, School of Architecture at Tsinghua University in Beijing, over email.</p>
<p>“There is still no direct evidence for the airborne transmission of the virus, however, some reported cases of infection occurred in poor ventilated spaces, such as restaurants.”</p>
<p>In one well-known restaurant example from China, members from three different families sitting at neighboring tables likely contracted COVID-19 from one individual who began showing symptoms later that day. A study on the outbreak concluded that the most likely cause was droplet transmission, with the strong air blowing from A/C sending the droplets further. The A/C itself tested negative for the virus, and staff and diners who were sitting away from that air current were not infected.</p>
<p>WHAT DOES “AIRBORNE” MEAN?</p>
<p>Part of the difficulty in getting a definitive answer on the question lies in distinguishing how scientists define “airborne” &ndash;and not all of them even agree on that &ndash; and what the public considers “airborne.”</p>
<p>Most scientists and public health officials define “airborne” under the technical “aerosol” definition &ndash; particles small enough to remain floating in the air over longer periods and distances. But most people have a simpler concern: can the virus be carried through the air and still infect me?</p>
<p>We know for certain the disease spreads through small droplets expelled from the nose or mouth during talking, sneezing or coughing. These droplets are too heavy to linger in the air for long before they are pulled down by gravity and land on a surface. You can be infected if you touch something contaminated with the virus and then touch your mouth, nose, or eyes.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization says it is “assessing ongoing research on the ways that COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.” A WHO brief issued in late March acknowledged that airborne transmission “may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures that generate aerosols are performed,” such as when health-care workers intubate infected patients, for example. But it also explicitly stated that “COVID-19 is NOT airborne” in a tweet around the same time.</p>
<p>Confusing, right?</p>
<p>“What I mean by airborne would be that the virus would easily transmit over extended distances through air currents,” explained Longtin, who is also an associate professor of medicine at McGill University. This means a patient four rooms down a hospital corridor could be infected with an airborne virus simply by breathing the same air, he said.</p>
<p>“We have to remember that airborne transmission remains what I would call a microbiologic aberration. Out of the hundreds and hundreds of microbes that can infect humans, there’s only three that are truly airborne - measles, varicella, and … tuberculosis.”</p>
<p>Even the virus that causes the common cold is not truly “airborne” under that definition, he added.</p>
<p>Airborne pathogens are incredibly contagious, Longtin said, and very short exposure &ndash; such as passing through a room of 30 people with a single infected case of the measles &ndash; can lead quickly to disease, but this is not what health-care workers have seen with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Specialists around the world are actively investigating whether SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the air. And if so, how long can it stay in the air? How infectious is it? How far can it travel?</p>
<p>Researchers in bio-aerosols have been sampling vast quantities of air to answer these questions and more. So far, they have detected pieces of the virus’s genome in the air.</p>
<p>A team with the University of Alberta&rsquo;s Mechanical Engineering Department received a $444,000 Canadian Institutes of Health Research government grant to study how the virus might travel as an airborne particle through a building&rsquo;s heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, and how to improve these systems to mitigate the potential spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Some studies have raised the possibility that the virus may linger in the air longer and travel over longer distances than previously thought. In one case, the virus could also be found in air pollution particles.</p>
<p>But it is unclear from these studies whether the virus is viable, Longtin noted, and if so, whether there is enough to infect an individual breathing that air.</p>
<p>The air current generated from simply walking through a room can be enough to raise dust from the ground, so it is possible that what is being sucked from the air is actually dead virus. Scientists have tried viral cultures to see if the virus is alive without success, Longtin noted.</p>
<p>Many of these studies also come with an important caveat: they are “preprints,” which means they have yet to be peer-reviewed and published in a journal &ndash; a process that can take months &ndash; and some have been criticized for their flawed methodologies.</p>
<p>The WHO noted that the results of one study examining the potential airborne qualities of the virus were generated under controlled laboratory conditions using high powered machines that do not reflect normal human cough conditions.</p>
<p>Because of the urgency of the pandemic, the wider research community, racing to understand as much as itcan about the virus, has welcomed the flood of preprints on COVID-19. But the public dialogue surrounding these papers also means that poorly done studies can be quickly picked up and disseminated by the media and public.</p>
<p>The reality is that definitive answers may take years &ndash; as they did for SARS &ndash; prompting some experts to recommend taking more proactive measures in the meantime.</p>
<p>Earlier in April, researchers at the Queensland University of Technology and the Chinese Academy of Sciences published a paper in Environment International urging health authorities around the world to recognize airborne transmissions as a likely mode of infection and to implement measures to mitigate its spread indoors. It pointed to research from the 2003 SARS outbreak, outbreaks on cruise ships, and the general science around viral infection spread as evidence the novel coronavirus is likely spreading through the air.</p>
<p>“When the epidemic is over and retrospective data demonstrates the importance of airborne transmission it will be too late,” the authors wrote. Lidia Morawska, one of the authors and an expert on air quality, human exposure, and aerosol science, told Nature: “In the mind of scientists working on this, there’s absolutely no doubt that the virus spreads in the air&hellip;This is a no-brainer.”</p>
<p>Other anecdotal instances &ndash; such as the spread of COVID-19 among members of a choir group in Washington state that attended a rehearsal in early March &ndash; already has some health officials concluding that the virus, while not necessarily airborne under the strict scientific definition, can be transmitted through air. In the choir’s case, no singers showed any symptoms at the time and the group made an effort to avoid touching during practice, but by the end of the month, some threequarters of the group who attended practice were confirmed to have COVID-19 or had symptoms, several were hospitalized, and two were dead.</p>
<p>And part of the protracted debate around masks was also about whether the virus was in the air or not.</p>
<p>DID PEOPLE GET SARS THROUGH BUILDING VENTILATION?</p>
<p>During the 2003 SARS outbreak, a cluster of cases was identified in an apartment complex in Hong Kong that was traced back to faeces. More than 300 residents were infected. Through an interconnected pipe system involving the bathroom floor drain and the sewage pipe, air containing a high concentration of SARS aerosols were drawn into bathrooms by the exhaust fan, which in turn also drew the contaminated air outside.</p>
<p>“Computer modelling on fluid flow has suggested this plume of gas from the exhaust fan rose up and affected neighboring buildings,” Wallace Leung, a filtration expert and professor at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, explained to CTVNews.ca via email.</p>
<p>Leung said the wind carried the plume of virus to the upper floors of other surrounding buildings, but spared the lower floors as well as buildings that were outside the wind pattern.</p>
<p>It took investigators several years to reach their findings.</p>
<p>There was fear that history could be repeating itself again when another old housing complex in Hong Kong confirmed two COVID-19 infections in February, but an investigation found that this situation was unique, Leung said. One of the infected residents had made alterations to their bathroom that left a toilet venting pipe disconnected and venting gas into the room, he explained. That pipe connected to a common vent, and investigators suspected that the resident may have been exposed to an infected individual 10 floors above as a result.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 &hellip; can be aerosolized as demonstrated in the example above,” despite disagreement from experts on the airborne mechanism of the virus, Leung said.</p>
<p>HOW VENTILATION WORKS</p>
<p>There are several ways that air might travel through a multi-unit dwelling, according to Jeffrey Siegel, an expert on indoor air quality and a professor with the Department of Civil and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>In a typical condominium or apartment, there are several ways air might travel into a unit:</p>
<p>Corridor ventilation - the fresh air that flows into the hall and flows into a residence through the undercuts of the front door</p>
<p>When windows are opened, air from one unit can flow into another</p>
<p>Toilet, plumbing, exhausts and vents</p>
<p>If you can smell your neighbour’s cooking, that means air is flowing from their apartment into yours</p>
<p>While you should be aware of the airflow in your home, said Siegel, becoming infected through the ventilation is unlikely, in part because of the way buildings and homes are designed. The connection from one unit or room to another is rarely a straight one.</p>
<p>“Even if there is transfer of airflow, it doesn’t mean the virus will transfer too. It depends on a lot of details around the particle size … as well as the kind of path it takes,” Siegel told CTVNews.ca.</p>
<p>WHAT CAN I DO?</p>
<p>Siegel and Zhao both stress there is no need to panic over home or building ventilation. Screening asymptomatic infectors and making sure they are self-isolating are more important preventative measures, said Zhao, adding that wearing a mask to protect others as well as avoiding confined spaces with poor or no ventilation were also key. Siegel added that above all else, proper hand washing, wearing masks, and physical distancing, both indoors and outdoors, are the most important measures to staying healthy.</p>
<p>But there are still things residents can do to help mitigate the possibility of becoming infected, Siegel said.</p>
<p>If there is someone sick or suspected to be sick in your household:</p>
<p>Try to keep them in their own space and isolate that space.</p>
<p>That part of the home should be as isolated from the rest of the home as possible. That means keeping the door to that room closed, and weather permitting, making sure there is a lot of ventilation in that room by opening the windows.</p>
<p>If possible, avoid sharing a bathroom.</p>
<p>If possible, put a fan by an open window and have it blowing out; ideally that keeps the room under slightly negative pressure with respect to the rest of the home</p>
<p>A portable HEPA filter air cleaner (not an ionizer or other non-filtration air cleaner) could also be considered to reduce the particles and droplets the person is producing in the isolated space.</p>
<p>How effective these steps are, however, really depends on the details of the building or house, the weather, and other factors, Siegel said, “but it doesn’t hurt.”</p>
<p>“The bottom line is, it’s almost impossible to really isolate one space in a home from another space.”</p>
<p>What about turning on the air-conditioning? If the A/C serves multiple units (for example, a single family home that’s been converted into multiple units), then Siegel suggests being more cautious. If it only serves one unit, then he would want to know if more air is being sucked into the unit from the outside or the corridor. If yes, then consider running the A/C only when necessary. But he cautioned residents not to create bigger health risks by not running the A/C just to mitigate the very small risk of contracting the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Zhao also recommended that building HVAC systems be run in &ldquo;all fresh air&rdquo; mode, with the ventilation rate increased to as high as the system can support.</p>
<p>What about someone who is healthy, but vulnerable or concerned about becoming infected by a sick family member? The advice is almost the same as that given for isolating someone who is sick in a home, Siegel said. The only difference is the fan by the window should be blowing into the space instead, in order to create a little bit of positive pressure in the room. Negative pressure allows air to flow into the room, but not escape from the room. Positive pressure does the opposite, allowing air to flow out of the room.</p>
<p>These steps can also apply to those living in a multi-family building, he added, except he would be much more cautious about opening the window.</p>
<p>“To my knowledge, there has been no reported transmission from out one window or vent into another, but everything I know about aerosol science says, you know, there’s a possibility there, so why risk it?” Siegel said.</p>
<p>“But I don’t want anyone to think that fans, filters, and ventilation are more important than hand washing, surface cleaning, all those other things that public health authorities are telling us to do.”</p>
