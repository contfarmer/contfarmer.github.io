<p>Aurier will decide if he plays for Tottenham after brother&rsquo;s death - Mourinho</p>
<p>Spurs will cater to the needs of their grieving player after his brother died on Monday</p>
<p>manager Jose Mourinho said he will let Serge Aurier decide if he wants to play or not following the death of his brother .</p>
<p>Media reports began to circulate on Monday claiming Christopher Aurier had been shot outside of a nightclub in .</p>
<p>The 26-year-old&rsquo;s death was later confirmed in a statement by Spurs.</p>
<p>Tottenham are in action against in the Premier League on Wednesday - as they attempt to qualify for the with three league matches remaining.</p>
<p>Mourinho confirmed he will talk with Aurier before deciding whether to involve him, while he also confirmed the player can go back to should he wish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t know [if the player would train later that day], I don&rsquo;t know what he is keen to do, I am not going to put any pressure on him,&rdquo; Mourinho said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he travels with us because it is good for him to travel but then he is not ready to play. At this moment I have no idea. I have no idea, the only thinking that is clear is that we are here to support him and not to demand anything of him at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[We gave him] all the options. He can do what he wants, he can go to France, he can stay here, he can come to training, he can go to the game.</p>
<p>“That&rsquo;s obvious, that&rsquo;s human, family is more important in this tragic situation than our need for him and our crucial match. Nothing matters, he does what he wants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me speak with him and we will see. At this moment I don&rsquo;t know. I spoke with him on the phone, no more than that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We gave him the space to process, the space for him to be involved with his family. We are going to make the decision that he wants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[Whether he plays] depends on the feelings I have on the conversation. We are going to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aurier has been a key player in Jose Mourinho&rsquo;s team since the Portuguese manager&rsquo;s arrival in November, and he has played 30 games in the Premier League this season with a goal to his name.

Serge Aurier won&rsquo;t be pressured to play after death of brother Christopher, says Jose Mourinho</p>
<p>Jose Mourinho gives instructions to Serge Aurier</p>
<p>Jose Mourinho says Tottenham will give Serge Aurier the time he needs to grieve, following the death of his brother in the early hours of Monday morning.</p>
<p>According to reports in France, Christopher Aurier was shot at a nightclub in the southern city of Toulouse.</p>

<p>The younger of the two brothers, Christopher Aurier was also a footballer and played for Rodeo Toulouse in the French fifth division last season.</p>

<p>Serge Aurier has been a fixture in Spurs&rsquo; team this season, playing in 30 of their last 31 Premier League games, but Mourinho is unsure whether the Ivorian defender will line up against Newcastle at St James&rsquo; Park on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this moment, what myself and other people at the club have spoken to him about is just about supporting a person that had a tragic moment within the family,&rdquo; Mourinho said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone is different. People react in different ways so we are going to respect 100 per cent Serge&rsquo;s decisions. [There is] no pressure from us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This afternoon, after training, we will have a better idea of what he wants to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ndombele and Alli doubtful with injuries</p>
<p>Tanguy Ndombele has not been picked by Jose Mourinho in recent weeks</p>
<p>Spurs are likely to be without midfielders Tanguy Ndombele, who picked up an injury in training on Monday, and Dele Alli, who is recovering from a hamstring injury, for the trip to Tyneside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday in training, Ndombele was injured,&rdquo; Mourinho said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he will be selected but we have another training session.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dele Alli may be training with us in the afternoon but I also don&rsquo;t believe that he can be [available].</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serge Aurier, of course, is a big question mark at this moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1:43 Tottenham manager Jose Mourhino wasn&rsquo;t happy about the decision to overturn Manchester City&rsquo;s European ban Tottenham manager Jose Mourhino wasn&rsquo;t happy about the decision to overturn Manchester City&rsquo;s European ban</p>
<p>The injury to Ndombele is another setback in what has been a disappointing first season in north London for Tottenham&rsquo;s record signing.</p>
<p>The French international has been limited to two substitute appearances since the Premier League restarted but Mourinho insists there is no problem between the pair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every player is part of my plans. Every one. I don&rsquo;t give up on players. No player has a privilege. Every player is for me the same. [There is] no problem at all,&rdquo; Mourinho said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No decision made on Rose&rsquo;s future&rsquo;</p>
<p>Danny Rose is on loan from Spurs at Newcastle until the end of the season</p>
<p>Mourinho also said no decision has been taken on the future of left-back Danny Rose, who is currently on loan at Newcastle.</p>
<p>The England international has one year remaining on his contract with Spurs and Mourinho said the club will decide after the season what the future holds for the 30-year-old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No decision is made,&rdquo; Mourinho said, when asked about Rose. &ldquo;To be honest, since he left I have not spoken with him. His feelings are important. His happiness is important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Steve Bruce and Newcastle also deserve to have an important word on this situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is our player and he has a contract so everything is open. We have three more matches in the next couple of weeks. After that there will be plenty of time to make decisions.&rdquo;

<p>Christopher Aurier was a football too</p>
<p>Christopher, like his brother, was a footballer and on the books at French fifth division side Toulouse Rodeo.</p>
<p>He came close to beating Serge to a move to England back in 2011, with a trial taken in at Brentford.</p>
<p>Of that experience, he told reporters in 2017: “Brentford were in League One at the time. Everything went well with my trial, but I could not speak English at the time.</p>
<p>“The coach [Uwe Rosler] told me: ‘It&rsquo;s a shame you can&rsquo;t understand my instructions. I&rsquo;d have signed you otherwise’.”</p>
<p>Christopher started out alongside Serge at RC Lens, but did not make a breakthrough at the highest level.</p>
<p>Tottenham have confirmed that defender Serge Aurier&rsquo;s brother died in the early hours of Monday morning, amid reports of a shooting. — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) July 13, 2020</p>
<p>He was a big supporter of his older sibling’s career, with one member of the Aurier family going on to grace the very top of the game.</p>
<p>Serge, after catching the eye at Lens, landed himself a move to Toulouse before eventually ending up at Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-German.</p>
<p>From there, he signed for Tottenham in 2017 and has gone on to take in 80 appearances for the club.</p>
<p>The most recent of those saw him play the full 90 minutes for Spurs as they secured a 2-1 victory over arch-rivals Arsenal.</p>
<p>Serge has also collected 62 caps for the Ivory Coast and formed part of their title-winning squad at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations.</p>

TOTTENHAM will let Serge Aurier decide if he wants to play against Newcastle following the tragic death of his brother.</p>
<p>The club confirmed on Monday that Christopher was shot dead outside a nightclub in Toulouse and paid tribute to the 26-year-old on social media.</p>

<p>Aurier, 27, has been a vital part of Mourinho&rsquo;s plans since the Portuguese&rsquo;s appointment in November.</p>
<p>And the boss is putting no pressure on the right-back to make the trip to the Toon on Wednesday if he is not in the right frame of mind.</p>
<p>Ahead of the clash, Mourinho said his main priority is to ensure Aurier is getting all the support he needs.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;In this moment, what myself and other people in the club spoke with him is just about supporting a person who has a tragic family moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apart from that, it’s just him, his feelings, his way of reacting. Every person is different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes with similar feelings, people react in a different way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we’re going to respect 100 per cent Serge&rsquo;s decisions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No pressure from us. This afternoon, before or after training, we’ll have a better idea of what he wants to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tottenham head into the clash three points adrift of Wolves who occupy sixth spot.</p>
<p>According to local media in France, Christopher was shot in the stomach and his murderer remains on the run.</p>
<p>The Club is deeply saddened to confirm media reports that Serge Aurier’s brother passed away in the early hours of this morning.</p>
<p>Everybody at the Club sends their sincerest condolences to Serge and his family. Our thoughts are with them all. pic.twitter.com/NVw0v9OWCR — Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) July 13, 2020</p>
<p>Christopher played football at an amateur level for Rodéo Toulouse in the French fifth division last season.</p>
<p>Like Serge, he progressed through the ranks at RC Lens in the early stages of his career.</p>
<p>He had a trial with Brentford back in 2011, but failed to make the cut with the Championship side.
