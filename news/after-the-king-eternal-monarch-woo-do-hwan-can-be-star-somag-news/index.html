<p>Representatives from the Key East Entertainment agency later confirmed the news to Newsen media, “The new drama ‘Hero’ is one of the dramas offered to him.”</p>

<p>Woo Do Hwan was offered the role of the main character Oh Gyu Tae, a former prosecutor who is currently unemployed. He was an amateur boxing athlete through high school, but after his brother’s mysterious suicide case, he gave up pursuing a career in sports.</p>
<p>The drama ‘Hero’ will be made by the Daydream Entertainment production house, with a script written by Park Hee Kang.</p>

<p><img src="https://6.viki.io/image/f8bf3795c092438cbd985d62c8219567.jpeg?s=900x600&amp;e=t" alt="img">
Woo Do Hwan is in talks to star in a new drama!</p>
<p>On June 10, a source from the drama industry stated to Ilgan Sports, “Woo Do Hwan will transform into Oh Gyu Tae, the main character of the drama ‘Hero’ slated to air on OCN.”</p>
<p>A source from KeyEast Entertainment clarified to Newsen, “The new drama ‘Hero’ is one of the projects he was offered.”</p>
<p>The idea behind “Hero” originates from the thought that a huge, invisible force is at work behind the unjust ways of the modern world where those who perform good deeds are treated like criminals. The drama tells the story of ordinary people who go against the enormous evil power that is throwing society into disorder in their attempt to reach their objectives.</p>
<p>Woo Do Hwan was offered the role of Oh Gyu Tae, a former prosecutor who is currently jobless. He was an amateur boxing athlete until high school, but after his older brother’s mysterious suicide, he gave up on pursuing a career in sports. He studied ardently and graduated at the top of the Judicial Research and Training Institute, becoming a promising prosecutor of the investigation department. However, during a trial for a troublemaking chaebol‘s assault case, he was unable to hold in his anger and ended up bringing down a law book on the chaebol‘s head. He was forced to retire from his position and had his license as a lawyer suspended for 10 years, ending his career in any legal profession. In the present, he makes close to zero income working part-time at a friend’s tuning shop and is practically jobless.</p>
<p>“Hero” will be produced by Daydream Entertainment, and screenwriter Park Hee Kang will work on the script.</p>
<p>Woo Do Hwan recently wrapped up filming for the ongoing drama “The King: Eternal Monarch.”</p>

The King: Eternal Monarch star Lee Min Ho poses with a white heath aster while Woo Do Hwan shared a sweet gift he received.</p>
<p>If you are picking boys over flowers (see what we did there!), here&rsquo;s Lee Min Ho giving you the option of picking a boy with flower. The King: Eternal Monarch may have ended. But we cannot get enough of Min Ho. The Korean actor has been the talk of the social media town ever since his comeback show released. While his fans have been looking forward to his return for months now, the show also garnered several first-time Korean show viewers who were smitten by Min Ho&rsquo;s charm.</p>
<p>Treating fans to his most recent look, Min Ho took to social media and shared a couple of pictures. Min Ho chose to hide his smile behind a black mask but his magical eyes were set on the camera as he posed with a white heath aster on his ear. The actor sported white round-neck tee with a baseball cap while posing for the pictures. Check out the photos below:</p>
<p>While Min Ho had fans go weak at the knees with his imperial portrayal of Lee Gon, fans of the show have lauded Woo Do Hwan for his dual portrayal on the show. The actor played Jo Eun Seob and Jo Young on the show. While there were numerous scenes where he left audiences speechless, the actor is bowled over with a gift he received following the end of the series. He took to his Instagram Stories to share a picture of miniatures he received of his two characters on the show.</p>

<h3 id="woo-do-hwan-was-offered-the-lead-role-in-the-new-k-drama-hero">&ldquo;Woo Do Hwan Was Offered The Lead Role In The New K-Drama &lsquo;Hero&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://images.summitmedia-digital.com/cosmo/images/2020/06/11/woo-do-hwan-lead-role-hero-drama-1591840094.jpg" alt="img">
Woo Do Hwan has been acting in dramas and films for years now, but his work in The King: Eternal Monarch is arguably his biggest break ever. In the fantasy and sci-fi drama, the 27-year-old actor won our hearts playing two roles: the icy chief royal guard Jo Young and the charismatic civil servant Eun Seob. And it seems his ace acting skills caught the eyes of producers because he was just offered a lead role in the new drama Hero.</p>

<p>According to Soompi, Do Hwan&rsquo;s agency KeyEast Entertainment confirmed the news with a statement, saying, &ldquo;The new drama Hero is one of the projects he was offered.&rdquo; So what exactly is Hero about and what role will Do Hwan play? Well, Soompi&rsquo;s description of the drama leans on the ~heavy~ side: &ldquo;The drama tells the story of ordinary people who go against the enormous evil power that is throwing society into disorder in their attempt to reach their objectives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Continue reading below ↓</p>
<p>Do Hwan was offered to play the role of former prosecutor Oh Gyu Tae, who worked his way up in his law profession. But everything he achieved was lost when he wasn&rsquo;t able to keep his anger in check during a trial with a difficult chaebol. After he ended up physically assaulting the chaebol, his license was suspended for 10 years. Gyu Tae now works part-time at a tuning shop to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s definitely a major ~acting piece~ right there. But for now, we&rsquo;re keeping our fingers crossed for Do Hwan&rsquo;s <em>possible</em> starring role!</p>
