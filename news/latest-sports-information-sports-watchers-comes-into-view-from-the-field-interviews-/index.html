<h3 id="andy-murray-if-something-happens-to-my-hip-now-theres-nothing-i-can-do">&ldquo;Andy Murray: If something happens to my hip now, there&rsquo;s nothing I can do&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://tennishead.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Andy-Murray-forehand.jpg" alt="img">
Andy Murray: If something happens to my hip now, there is nothing I can do about it</p>
<p>Share: 4 Shares</p>
<p>Andy Murray says he would not be able to do ‚Äòanything about it‚Äô if something happened to his hip now, other than retire.</p>
<p>Murray has endured a torrid time with injuries since climbing to world number one in 2016.</p>
<p>He has finally started making inroads into a comeback bid but only after drastic hip-resurfacing surgery, and he admits it has left him in last chance saloon.</p>
<p>Murray told the Guardian: ‚ÄúPeople ask me, who will retire first: Federer, Djokovic, Nadal or myself?</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôd say Federer. He‚Äôs 39. But who knows?</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf something happened to my hip, for instance, I couldn‚Äôt do anything about it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Murray also addressed his on-court demeanour, and revealed he is completely different away from tennis than he is perceived on court.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPeople see me on TV and think I am very intense, moody and difficult.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut take me away from the court and I‚Äôm pretty laid-back. I don‚Äôt have a temper. I don‚Äôt break things; I don‚Äôt punch walls; I don‚Äôt shout and scream.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut when I‚Äôm on the tennis court, I do.‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="the-great-carson-wentz-transformation-saves-the-eagles-vs-giants">&ldquo;The great Carson Wentz transformation saves the Eagles vs. Giants&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nbcsports.com/sites/rsnunited/files/article/hero/Wentz_C_Mailata_J_USATSI_15100128.jpg" alt="img">
For most of the night, it was same, ol‚Äô Carson. Inconsistent throws. Poor decisions. A terrible turnover.</p>
<p>And the Eagles appeared headed for another miserable loss.</p>
<p>But something happens with this guy. When things are at their most hopeless, Carson Wentz finds a way.</p>
<p>He did it Sunday with a 22-point fourth quarter that almost rallied the Eagles back from 18 points down against the Ravens, and he did it again Thursday night with two TD passes in the game‚Äôs final 4 1/2 minutes to lead the Eagles back from an 11-point deficit.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôd love to not be in those situations where our backs are against the wall,‚Äù Wentz said after the Eagles improved to 2-4-1 with a 22-21 win over the Giants at the Linc. ‚ÄúWe left a lot of plays out there. We were in the red zone a lot and didn‚Äôt score many points. Those are the things we have to clean up and be better. But when our backs are against the wall and we have to make plays, I‚Äôm going to give guys all the opportunity in the world to make them.‚Äù</p>
<p>Wentz the last two weeks in the first three quarters: 31-for-55 for 358 yards, 0 TDs, 1 INT, 68.6 passer rating.</p>
<p>Wentz the last two weeks in the fourth quarter: 15-for-28 for 214 yards, 4 TDs, 0 INTs, 118.2 passer rating.</p>
<p>He changes. The mistakes disappear. Touchdowns miraculously appear. Magic happens.</p>
<p>‚ÄúQuarterbacks sometimes get measured by 4th-quarter comebacks, and the last couple of weeks, we&rsquo;ve put ourselves in position to really either tie the game a week ago, and of course this week win the game,‚Äù Doug Pederson said. ‚ÄúThat&rsquo;s what it takes. Especially the situation that we are in health-wise as a team, we know these games are going to be probably closer than we would like. But it is good to see your quarterback standing there, go toe-to-toe, take some shots and still lead your team down the field for the win.‚Äù</p>
<p>Wentz has had his problems this year. He threw his NFL-leading 10th interception in the second quarter, he‚Äôs still near the bottom of the NFL in accuracy and he has yet to play a consistent 60 minutes.</p>
<p>But he‚Äôs a guy that never stops grinding, never stops battling, no matter what it says on the scoreboard. That rubs off on his teammates and gives this team a chance until the clock runs down to all zeroes.</p>
<p>He‚Äôs now thrown more touchdowns in the fourth quarter (six) than in the first three quarters combined (4).</p>
<p>On Thursday night, just like in the Ravens game, he took a brutal beating ‚Äî sacked three times, hit 10 times by the Giants ‚Äî but shrugged it off.</p>
<p>He drove the Eagles 78 and 71 yards in the game‚Äôs final 6 1/2 minutes, throwing spectacular TDs of 3 yards to Greg Ward and 18 yards to Boston Scott ‚Äî two practice squad alums ‚Äî in the span of less than four minutes.</p>
<p>This was the first time an Eagles QB has thrown two TDs in the final five minutes to win a game since Nick Foles threw TDs to Clay Harbor and Jeremy Maclin in Tampa in 2012 in Andy Reid‚Äôs final win as head coach of the Eagles.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt a lot of time, but we said there was enough time,‚Äù Wentz said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs enough time, we just have to keep believing and just take it one play at a time. Obviously we were in turbo, on-the-ball, two-minute mode the rest of the game. (It was) the same thing that I echo every game when we‚Äôre down: ‚ÄòJust keep believing, just one play at a time and a big play is going to hit. It‚Äôs going to happen.‚Äô</p>
<p>&ldquo;John (Hightower) had the big one that first drive and obviously Boston on the second drive. Guys just keep believing and keep rallying together and that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs going to take to win a lot of these ball games.‚Äù</p>
<p>The mistakes are still happening. The inconsistency. The turnovers. The misfires.</p>
<p>And they drive you crazy.</p>
<p>But the fourth-quarter magic is there, and it‚Äôs special. And if he can just bottle that up and spread it out over four quarters? The Eagles just may be able to salvage something out of this ugly season.</p>

<h3 id="dizzying-scenarios-when-something-happens-to-a-president-who-takes-charge">&ldquo;Dizzying scenarios: When something happens to a president, who takes charge?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_40/3417047/201002-succesion-trump-coronavirus-main-cover-cs_32caf2f1d86902f3017f90b22031f813.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg" alt="img">
When President George W. Bush checked into the hospital for routine colonoscopies in 2002 and 2007, the procedures required him to be sedated, unable to act in an emergency. So he invoked a provision of the Constitution that temporarily put his vice president in charge.</p>
<p>That same provision of the 25th Amendment can be invoked whenever a president is, for any reason, unable to carry out the duties of the office. It was adopted after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, because Congress realized there was no clear answer to who was supposed to be in charge.</p>
<p>It addressed the Kennedy situation by saying that whenever a president dies or resigns, the vice president becomes president.</p>
<p>But a different provision covers presidential illnesses like Covid-19.</p>
<p>A president who knows he is or will be unable to perform the duties of the office notifies Congress, and the vice president becomes the acting president. That arrangement continues until the president sends another notice to declare that he is once again able to do the job.</p>
<p>The amendment also contains a provision that has never been invoked to cover the eventuality of a president unable to do the job but also unable to notify Congress. If the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet members determine that the president is unable to carry out his duties, then the vice president becomes the acting president.</p>
<p>In addition, the rules and bylaws of the two major political parties govern what would happen if a presidential candidate resigns or dies before the general election, according to John Fortier, an expert on presidential succession at the Bipartisan Policy Center. The national committee of the affected party would choose a new candidate.</p>
<p>If the candidate dies after the election but before the Electoral College meets in mid-December, the national party would again choose a replacement and the electors would vote for that person, Fortier said.</p>
<p>If the death or resignation happens after Congress counts the electoral votes but before Inauguration Day, the 20th Amendment provides that the vice president becomes president.</p>
<p>If both the president and the vice president become incapacitated, the Constitution doesn&rsquo;t directly provide the answer. But a federal law, the Presidential Succession Act, fills in that blank.</p>
<p>First in line to serve as the acting president is the House speaker, now Nancy Pelosi, followed by the president pro tem of the Senate, who is now Chuck Grassley of Iowa, followed by members of the Cabinet.</p>
<p>But Pelosi or Grassley might be reluctant to accept the role, because they would be required to resign from Congress in order to take the position and could serve only until Congress finally decided who the president will be.</p>
<p>Brian Kalt, a professor at the Michigan State University College of Law, said the lack of constitutional clarity could lead to problems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The speaker could claim that she&rsquo;s in charge under statute but that could be legally challenged, potentially by the secretary of state, who is the next executive branch official in the line of succession,&rdquo; Kalt said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no precedent in American history for both the president and the vice president becoming unable to carry out their duties,&rdquo; added Kalt, author of &ldquo;Unable: The Law, Politics, and Limits of Section 4 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a process; we don&rsquo;t have standards,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You could have (Secretary of State Mike) Pompeo coming in and saying, &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m in charge.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Fortier doubts it would come to that, saying, &ldquo;If they both become incapacitated, then we&rsquo;d follow the Succession Act.&rdquo;

Broadcaster Joe Buck has been silent since he and his broadcast partner Troy Aikman were caught on mic during Monday Night Football appearing to slam military flyovers at sporting events. Aikman backtracked on those comments on Twitter the very next day, but Buck said nothing at all.</p>
<p>It turns out Buck‚Äôs silence wasn‚Äôt a sign that he was abandoning Aikman, but rather an effort to try and make the whole thing go away. On ‚ÄúDaddy Issues,‚Äù his podcast with actor Oliver Hudson, Buck finally commented on the whole kerfuffle and explained exactly what happened.</p>
<p>‚Äò100 percent sarcastic‚Äô</p>
<p>Buck and Aikman laughing at military flyovers, plus Aikman saying they would no longer happen on a ‚ÄúKamala-Biden ticket,‚Äù appeared to be a hot mic situation, with neither knowing they were actually being recorded while they were talking. On the podcast, Buck said that it definitely wasn‚Äôt a case of them blabbing into a hot mic.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what people don‚Äôt get. They say that this was an open mic or a hot mic. It wasn‚Äôt. This was before our rehearsal. So this wasn‚Äôt like ‚ÄòOops, we‚Äôre on, I can‚Äôt believe I just said that, oh my God we‚Äôre on.‚Äô That‚Äôs not what happened.‚Äù</p>

<p>So what actually did happen? Aikman wasn‚Äôt caught in a moment of scalding honesty, he was actually being sarcastic and imitating a close friend from their FOX NFL crew while he and Buck were joking around before the broadcast.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is going on before the anthem. We‚Äôre rehearsing and joking around, which I‚Äôve done and every broadcaster does, I‚Äôve done it for 30 years. &hellip; Troy, in the microphone, is repeating something that he heard the night before from &hellip; an unnamed person on our crew, saying ‚Äî this person happens to be very far-left ‚Äî ‚ÄòOh, well, under Biden-Harris, that‚Äôs not gonna happen!‚Äô And Troy was repeating that, watching the flyover. So they clipped that, as if he‚Äôs saying that, as if he‚Äôs a Harris-Biden fan. And he‚Äôs repeating something that somebody said the night before! &hellip; If you know Troy at all, he was being 100 percent sarcastic.‚Äù</p>
<p>Buck then joined in the fun, using what he called a ‚Äú1950s voice‚Äù to say something about ‚Äúyour tax dollars at work.‚Äù That pre-broadcast moment was then clipped by an unknown employee and leaked to Defector. Buck said that there‚Äôs currently an internal investigation to find out who did it.</p>
<p>What took Buck so long to say something?</p>
<p>Buck didn‚Äôt say anything about the flyover comments for three days after it happened, and on the podcast he revealed why he chose to stay silent. He wasn‚Äôt hanging Aikman out to dry; he was trying to make the controversy go away.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf something happens and it becomes quote-unquote ‚Äòcontroversial,‚Äô if you then weigh in on the other end you then give it more air and you give it more life. If I sit off to the side and let people think what they want to think ‚Äî which, they‚Äôre so wrong and they just read headlines and they don‚Äôt have any idea how this whole thing unfolded ‚Äî then if I chime in, it lives on another couple days. If I just shut up it flares up for 18 hours and then in this news cycle it‚Äôs gone.‚Äù</p>
<p>That absolutely did not happen in this case, mostly because no one explained how Aikman had been caught saying what he‚Äôd said, and that includes Aikman himself. Waiting three days before offering the only explanation for an embarrassing broadcasting moment extends the story.</p>
<p>But now the truth is known. Aikman apparently doesn‚Äôt hate flyovers. A concerned nation can finally rest easy.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5KNGO4AVIEI6XISYMFFM6K4QNU.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
These data are derived from applications to the Internal Revenue Service for new employer identification numbers. Most represent individuals striking out on their own, something that always happens when regular jobs are scarce, although previously not to quite this extent. But the Census Bureau also uses several filters to sort out new businesses with a high propensity to employ others, and those applications are on the rise, too ‚Äî in stark contrast to what happened during the last recession.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Great Recession was too harsh for small businesses to be able to try new things,‚Äù says John Haltiwanger, an economics professor at the University of Maryland. ‚ÄúThey couldn‚Äôt get loans, asset values were low.‚Äù This time around, thanks in part to massive early intervention by Congress and the Federal Reserve but also to the unconventional nature of the recession, stock prices and house prices are up and banks are healthy. Getting financing for a new business is far easier than it was a decade ago. And because of the huge changes in economic behavior brought on by the pandemic, a lot of people have ideas for new businesses.</p>
<p>Haltiwanger is one of a group of economists who a few years ago started producing research showing a decline in U.S. business dynamism. The number of startups has been falling since the 1990s, and so has the number of business failures. Schumpeter‚Äôs concept of creative destruction has been as prominent as ever in the rhetoric of business executives, but awfully hard to find in the data.</p>
<p>The Census Bureau started releasing business formation data as an outgrowth of this research, and for the past few months it has shown something new and different is afoot. It‚Äôs not something entirely positive: Equally timely and reliable data on business closures aren‚Äôt available, but a new paper by several Federal Reserve Board economists finds that ‚Äúexit has been elevated at least among small firms and particularly in industries most sensitive to social distancing,‚Äù with restaurant closures in particular about 50% above the normal pace. But it is at least dynamic.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been this enormous shock to how we interact with each other, and it‚Äôs a positive sign there are lots of entrepreneurs out there trying to respond to that,‚Äù says Haltiwanger. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this is like the ‚Äò90s, where we saw a surge of startups because of the tech revolution ‚Äî that came out of very positive forces. This happens sometimes as the economy gets hit by a shock that has aggregate consequences.‚Äù</p>
<p>This week the Census Bureau for the first time released data sorting the new-business numbers by industry. What it shows more than anything is entrepreneurs seeing opportunity in online retail.</p>
<p>Interestingly, restaurants and bars (‚Äúfood services and drinking places‚Äù) are being started in greater numbers than usual, even as they close at a faster pace than usual. Same with clothing stores. ‚ÄúThe question is what parts of in-person activity will come back,‚Äù says Haltiwanger. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to imagine that restaurants won‚Äôt be back, but bricks-and-mortar retail for clothes? I‚Äôm not saying that there isn‚Äôt going to be any of that, but less.‚Äù</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Still, the fact that there‚Äôs so much business-formation happening is a sign the aftermath of this recession might not be the long, painful slog the early 2010s were. ‚ÄúOne of the reasons we took so long to recover from the Great Recession is startups got clobbered and didn‚Äôt come back,‚Äù Haltiwanger says.</p>
<p>If it takes longer than hoped to emerge from the pandemic, and/or the economy backslides into a double-dip recession, then startups could of course get clobbered again. ‚ÄúCreative destruction‚Äù is often cited as a reason why governments shouldn‚Äôt intervene in the economy and the business cycle should be allowed to take its course. But in this case intervention seems to have helped create the conditions that enabled an entrepreneurship boom. Let‚Äôs hope it isn‚Äôt allowed to fizzle.</p>
