<p>Starting XIs</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>Genoa started brightly and was on the front foot. That stage of the match didn’t last long, though, with Inter growing into the game and taking control around the 10th minute mark. The Nerazzurri had to wait until the 30th minute for it’s first real opportunity of the half. Deep in the box, Lukaku laid a pass backwards to Christian Eriksen. The Dane, though, could only blast the ball well over the goal from near the PK spot.</p>
<p>That miss only delayed what seemed inevitable, an Inter goal. In the 34th minute, Cristiano Biraghi sent a cross to Lukaku in the right side of the six-yard-box. The 27-year-old headed the ball into the near post netting to give Inter a 1-0 lead that it would never relinquish.</p>
<p>Inter dominated the first forty-five, completely winning the midfield battle (as shown by the touches map below). Eventually, that much of the ball in Genoa’s half was going to result in a dangerous look at goal, even with Genoa keeping Inter out of the final third for much of the half.</p>
<p>Again, Genoa was largely non-existent from the middle of the pitch, while Inter found less and less space out the deeper into the hosts half it got.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>The second period was much slower in tempo, and bereft of chances for either side until the final twenty minutes. In the 70th minute, Victor Moses played the ball across the goalmouth to a sliding Borja Valero, but the Spaniard’s point blank effort was blocked.</p>
<p>Genoa pressed for an equalizer, and kept Inter pinned back in its own half. In fact, a Grifone goal seemed increasingly likely until Sánchez doubled Inter’s advantage against the run of play, it must be said. In the 83rd minute, Moses sent a cross to the Chilean at the top of the six-yard-box. Sánchez volleyed home off the top of the crossbar.</p>
<p>Lukaku iced the cake in stoppage time with his 23rd goal of the Serie A campaign. In the 93rd minute, he embarked upon a solo run from midfield into the box. There, some nifty footwork opened up space for him to slot the ball into the far post from the top corner of the six-yard-box. Quite simply, an incredible effort from Inter’s leading scorer.</p>
<p>Recap</p>
<p>Despite the scoreline, very little separated the sides other than quality. Although the first half was clearly Inter’s to own, nothing separated the two sides in the second, except quality. Genoa and Inter each tallied five shots, with two on target, while possession was practically equal as well. The heatmap shows the same:</p>
<p>You could play count the differences with these heatmaps, and maybe get to five. The only notable one is Genoa blank space in Inter’s box. Davide Nicola’s side never caused Samir Handanović much of an issue, which is fortunate considering the captain’s current run of form in which he has decided to impersonate a block of Swiss cheese. That won’t be the case against Lorenzo Insigne and Napoli, to say the least.</p>
<p>Other major parts of the first team who haven’t been excellent in recent times are Eriksen and Lautaro Martínez. Eriksen put in the effort, but came up short in the final third yet again. If he doesn’t start coming up with the end product, it’s hard too see him at the San Siro next season. Lautaro, meanwhile, was invisible for much of the game, and didn’t seem to try too hard to make a more positive impact. I’m starting to forget what the Argentine looks like, since the camera is on him so little. Sánchez replaced him, and went on to score Inter’s second. Perhaps there’s a new pecking order up top now that the Man United loanee is healthy.</p>
<p>Inter now goes to 2nd, one point above Atalanta and four ahead of Lazio. Even if staying in 2nd is a difficult task, with games against Napoli and La Dea to close out the season, a drop to 4th seems unlikely. Until Tuesday, and the penultimate regular season match against Napoli. Forza Inter!

Antonio Conte has dismissed the &ldquo;fantasy football&rdquo; idea that Inter Milan would make a sensational move for Barcelona captain Lionel Messi in the summer.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old Argentine superstar&rsquo;s Barca future has been cast in doubt for much of this season as the Spanish side failed to retain the La Liga title.</p>
<p>And a recent report sparked rumours that Messi could move to Inter after his father bought a house in Milan this week.</p>
<p>Advert</p>
<p>Speaking after Inter&rsquo;s 3-0 victory over Genoa on Saturday, Conte insisted that he couldn&rsquo;t think of a &ldquo;madman in the world who wouldn&rsquo;t want Messi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the 50-year-old Italian manager explained why the six-time Ballon d&rsquo;Or winner isn&rsquo;t part of Inter&rsquo;s plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re talking about fantasy football, situations that at the moment cannot be linked to Inter. For many reasons,&rdquo; Conte told reporters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a madman in the world who wouldn&rsquo;t want Messi. But that kind of situation really is very, very, very far from Inter, from what we are doing and what we are trying to build.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to create a solid base, and then maybe&hellip; I repeat, this is fantasy football; however, I like the fact that when fantasy football is involved, the team that is linked to it is always Inter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Advert</p>
<p>Credit: PA</p>
<p>But Inter CEO Giuseppe Marotta, much like Conte, argued that trying to sign the Barcelona captain is &ldquo;fantasy football.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told Sky Sport Italia: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fantasy football. He certainly is not one of our objectives and I think he&rsquo;s interested in continuing his football career in Barcelona.&rdquo;

Lukaku has now scored 23 times in Serie A this season</p>
<p>Inter Milan moved into second place in Serie A, four points behind leaders Juventus, with a 3-0 win over Genoa thanks to goals from Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez.</p>
<p>Juve will win the league with two games to spare if they beat Sampdoria on Sunday, but have only won once in their past five games.</p>
<p>Lukaku opened the scoring in the 34th minute with a header from a Cristiano Biraghi cross, before Sanchez struck in the 83rd minute, and Lukaku added his second in stoppage time.</p>
<p>Inter went above Atalanta with the win, while Genoa remain fourth from bottom, four points above the relegation zone having played a game more than Lecce, their rivals for the final relegation place.

<h3 id="inter-milan-reportedly-eye-sensational-move-for-lionel-messi-in-2021">&ldquo;Inter Milan reportedly eye sensational move for Lionel Messi in 2021&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://gmsrp.cachefly.net/images/20/07/25/572d802d130086a01981ac5e896b994c/1200.jpg" alt="img">
Lionel Messi playing for a club other than FC Barcelona is unthinkable.</p>
<p>However, in the past few weeks and months, that scenario appears to be slightly less unthinkable.</p>
<p>The Argentine joined Barca as a 13-year-old. Twenty years, 633 goals, 30 trophies and six Ballon d’Ors later, Messi has established himself as the greatest to have ever played the game.</p>
<p>But has he had enough at the Camp Nou?</p>
<p>Following Barcelona’s shock defeat at home to Osasuna on a night when Real Madrid sealed the La Liga title, Messi didn’t hold back in his post-match interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This game represents the entire year. We have been an erratic and weak team,” he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madrid did its part by winning all its matches, which is impressive, but we also helped them to win this league. We have to be critical of how we have played, starting with the players, and the rest of the club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have lost because of our mistakes and not because of Madrid&rsquo;s successes, as many say. The feeling on this team is that it tries, but that it cannot get the job done. Today in the first half they were better than we were and it seems we have to fall behind to react like we tried to do in the second half.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to have to change a lot if we want to do something&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said it some time ago, that playing like this we had no chance of winning the Champions League, and it turns out we didn&rsquo;t even have enough to win La Liga,&rdquo; the Argentine continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to take a breather, let some air in, and clean out minds of all that has happened since December. Playing like this we will lose against Napoli.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to start from zero in the Champions League and blame ourselves for what went wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, rumours started circulating about Messi’s future.</p>
<p>While it was confirmed that he wouldn’t be leaving the club this summer, it doesn’t seem implausible that he will fancy a new challenge come the summer of 2021.</p>
<p>Enter, Inter Milan.</p>
<p>According to Italian outlet Gazzetta dello Sport, Inter are eyeing a sensational move to sign Messi at the end of his contract in 2021. In fact, it even made the front page of the newspaper.</p>
<p>The club’s majority shareholders Suning Holdings Group believe they have the cash to offer him his required wages.</p>
<p>What’s more, Messi’s father, Jorge, is moving his business to Milan next month and Inter believe this is the first step to making the move happen.</p>
<p>As we say, Messi playing for a club other than Barca seems impossible and Inter certainly aren’t the first club to think they have the ability to sign the GOAT.</p>
<p>It’s a pipe dream but wouldn’t it be great to see Messi tear it up for another club in another league?</p>
<p>Even if he is 34 by then…</p>

Inter Milan are plotting a sensational swoop for Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi next summer, according to reports.</p>
<p>Gazetta dello Sport claim Inter’s majority shareholders Suning Holdings Group are confident they can lure the 33-year-old to the San Siro next year.</p>

<p>Despite Barca being pipped to the title by arch nemesis Real Madrid, Messi has enjoyed a productive campaign with 30 goals in all competitions.</p>
<p>The reported move of Messi’s father – Jorge – and his business to Milan could also prove to be an added incentive for the Argentina forward.</p>
<p>Messi was incensed following Barca’s shock 2-1 defeat at home to 10-man Osasuna on the final day of the 2019/20 campaign.</p>
<p>“Roma, Liverpool… the fans are running out of patience because we’re not giving them anything,” he admitted.</p>
<p>Adrian Durham says Chris Waddle was the best player he&rsquo;d seen live before Lionel Messi</p>
<p>“If we want to fight for the Champions League, a lot has to change. Like this, we will lose to Napoli.</p>

INTER MILAN are planning a sensational swoop for Lionel Messi next summer, according to reports.</p>
<p>The Argentine is in the midst of a frosty rift with Barcelona chiefs and the Serie A side look set to try and take advantage of the feud with a &ldquo;2021 assault&rdquo;.</p>
<p>2 Inter Milan are planning to swoop for Lionel Messi next summer</p>
<p>2 Italian outlet Gazzaetta dello Sport says the Serie A side will try to capitalise on his rift with Barca</p>
<p>Messi&rsquo;s deal runs out next summer and the Italians hope to lure him away from the Nou Camp with a mega money deal, according to Gazzetta dello Sport.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old superstar has bagged 30 goals in all competitions this season.</p>
<p>And Inter&rsquo;s majority shareholders Suning Group Holdings reportedly believe they can stump up the dough to prise Messi away from the Nou Camp and to the San Siro next season.</p>
<p>Portuguese outlet A Bola report Inter will offer a three-year deal worth £45.5million-a-year.</p>
<p>It also emerged yesterday Messi&rsquo;s dad and agent Jorge has splashed out some cash on a plush new pad in the Italian capital Milan.</p>
<p>He is said to be pulling the strings of his son&rsquo;s potential switch to the Nerazzuri next season.</p>
<p>According to Italian outfit Radio Rai, Jorge purchased a home in Milan&rsquo;s Porta Nova neighbourhood to prepare for his son&rsquo;s Barca departure.</p>
<p>It comes after Messi slammed Barcelona as “weak” and “erratic” following their 2-1 home defeat to Osasuna - a result that crowned Madrid champs.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t want to end the season like this but it represents how the season has gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were a very erratic, very weak, low-intensity team. We lost a lot of points and today&rsquo;s game is a summary of the season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to be self-critical. Starting with the players but doing a global self-criticism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are Barca and we have to win everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t look at Madrid. Madrid have done their job, but we have helped them a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Messi has been linked with a transfer to Inter in the past and tyre company Pirelli will reportedly back club president Steven Zhang in an audacious move for the 33-year-old.</p>
<p>But their chief executive admitted the contribution can only be small following the financial fall out of the coronavirus pandemic.

<h3 id="man-utd-loanee-alexis-sanchezs-brilliant-form-at-inter-milan-revealed-in-compilation">&ldquo;Man Utd loanee Alexis Sanchez&rsquo;s brilliant form at Inter Milan revealed in compilation&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://gmsrp.cachefly.net/images/20/07/26/123b3a97ea690699538ce87e5a7c6cce/1200.jpg" alt="img">
Manchester United fans don&rsquo;t exactly have many positive things to say about Alexis Sanchez.</p>
<p>There was a real buzz when the Chilean arrived from Arsenal in January 2018, but he turned out to be one of the worst signings in Premier League history.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough that Sanchez only managed to score five times in 45 appearances for the Red Devils, never mind when he was collecting a mind-bending wage of £500,000-a-week.</p>
<p>Loaned out to Inter Milan</p>
<p>And as much Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has remained coy about Sanchez returning to United next season, there&rsquo;s good reason to think he&rsquo;s already played his final game at Old Trafford.</p>
<p>Sanchez was hastily sent out on loan to Inter Milan last summer and the early signs at the San Siro suggested that the former Barcelona man had hardly improved upon moving to Italy.</p>
<p>Even when Sanchez got off the mark with his first goal for the club against Sampdoria, his rotten run of form seemed to continue by collecting a second yellow card for a dive just minutes later.</p>
<p>Finding his feet in Italy</p>
<p>However, fast forward to the closing games of the Serie A season and Sanchez&rsquo;s form is reminding the footballing world why United shelled out half-a-million-a-week for him in the first place.</p>
<p>Inter were 3-0 victors over Genoa on Saturday night with Sanchez helping himself to a goal from close range, while his old United teammate Romelu Lukaku also bagged a brace.</p>
<p>In fact, Sanchez has now provided seven assists, scored three goals and collected three Man of the Match awards since the restart alone, including a stunning match rating of 9.5 against Brescia.</p>
<p>Video of Sanchez&rsquo;s revival</p>
<p>And his average match rating of 6.99 throughout the entire season is above the likes of Luke Shaw, Mason Greenwood, David de Gea, Scott McTominay and Fred at his old employers.</p>
<p>But we all know that stats don&rsquo;t tell us everything, so let&rsquo;s refer to the video evidence as well and YouTuber &lsquo;MShow&rsquo; came up trumps last week with a phenomenal compilation of the Chilean.</p>
<p>Titled: &lsquo;Alexis Sánchez Is Proving The Haters Wrong In 2020!', it shows how Sanchez has really come into his own under Antonio Conte in recent months and you can check it out down below:</p>
<p>GIVEMESPORT&rsquo;s Kobe Tong says</p>
<p>So, should United take him back? Not for me, but let&rsquo;s be happy that one of the most energetic and exciting footballers of the last 10 years is finally finding his mojo again.</p>
<p>At the very least, Ed Woodward will be rubbing his hands together because he&rsquo;ll know this recent run of form will increase both demand and transfer offers for Sanchez this summer.</p>
<p>As nice as it would be to see Sanchez returning to United and showing the sort of form that fans expected from him back in 2018, there&rsquo;s nothing to suggest it wouldn&rsquo;t be a step backwards.</p>
<p>The thrilling youth of an offensive triumvirate of Greenwood, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford is really something that Solskjaer should kindle as a long-term approach for the club.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even as though Sanchez would be a cheaper option to Jadon Sancho, either, with Sanchez&rsquo;s gargantuan pages shovelling about 500,000 hands into the United wallet.</p>
<p>So, yes, congratulations to Sanchez on delivering what we know he can, but the ship has sailed in terms of thriving at United. Sorry, Alexis.</p>
