<p>Craig Burley believes Arsenal must go all-out to keep Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at the Emirates next season. (1:25)</p>
<p>Congratulations are most definitely due to Arsenal for winning the FA Cup, beating Chelsea 2-1 in the first ever socially distanced final at Wembley on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>It marks the 14th time the Gunners have got their hands on the trophy and the 25th season in a row in which they&rsquo;ve qualified for Europe, which is quite a feat in itself.</p>
<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang may have scored the two vital goals that earned the victory but he still looked slightly out of sorts once tasked with lifting the cup after the game.</p>

<p>Having first struggled to lift the cup from its plinth, the Gabonese striker proceeded to awkwardly chuck the trophy on the floor while attempting to carry it over to the rest of the team.</p>
<p>With the lift finally mastered, the celebrations could really begin as Mikel Arteta relished winning his first piece of silverware as Arsenal manager.</p>
<p>Indeed, Arteta becomes the first Gunners boss to win a major trophy in their debut season since George Graham, who won the League Cup in 1986-87.</p>
<p>The Arsenal academy also looked on with pride as four of their recent graduates were involved on the big day: Bukayo Saka, Joe Willock, Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson.</p>
<p>Back in the changing room, the customary dancing took place as champagne suds covered the tiled floor and quickly turned the whole thing into a perilous health hazard.</p>

<p>However, there can be no doubt that the most emotional man of the pitch was goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez who could be seen weeping tears of joy as he called home to break the good news.</p>
<p>The Arsenal goalkeeper, who has filled in admirably for the injured Bernd Leno, then topped off his special day with a sneaky trip to McDonalds with friend Lucas Torriera.</p>
<p>We can think of no better way to mark such a historic day &ndash; though the fact that Arsenal&rsquo;s cup win also serves to bump Tottenham down the continental pecking order and into preliminary qualifying rounds of the Europa League is also likely to be considered the perfect bonus.</p>
<p>All in all, a good day for the Gunners.

Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights: Arsenal beat Chelsea 2-1 to win FA Cup</p>
<p>Arsenal&rsquo;s coach arrived at Wembley for the Heads Up FA Cup final to be greeted by a small group of observers and one middle-aged supporter waving a large flag.</p>
<p>The Gunners&rsquo; match-winner Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang concluded the victory celebrations by stepping down alone from the winners&rsquo; podium, scrambling his way through gold streamers scattered on the turf before taking polite applause from those left inside a virtually deserted national stadium.</p>
<p>In between, Arsenal&rsquo;s world-class striker delivered a match-winning virtuoso display against Chelsea to settle a final that deserved to be played out in front of a full house in the famous arena - not a select few on the first occasion the great domestic showpiece has been played behind closed doors.</p>
<p>Many games have been accompanied by a surreal air since &ldquo;Project Restart&rdquo; took the sport out of its hiatus caused by the coronavirus pandemic - none more so than this final, the game that traditionally provides the grand conclusion to the domestic season.</p>
<p>A small number of Arsenal fans celebrate on Wembley Way after the club secure a record 14th FA Cup triumph</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wembley ghost town&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the hours before the kick-off, it was almost like a ghost town - as far away from the usual pomp and excitement and buzzing FA Cup final atmosphere as it is possible to get.</p>
<p>There were touches of the old ceremonials, such as the rendition of the FA Cup final anthem &lsquo;Abide With Me&rsquo; delivered in pre-recorded fashion by Emeli Sande with dramatic pictures of her standing on the roof beamed into the stadium via the giant screens.</p>
<p>No pre-match presentations to members of the Royal Family. No smart suits for players or managers.</p>
<p>It is not sour or unromantic but simple reality to record that this did not feel like the normal FA Cup final.</p>
<p>The final was played at a near-empty Wembley</p>
<p>&lsquo;A final fit for 90,000 fans&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was a game that deserved to be played out before a full house not 90,000 empty red seats. It had a winning goal that deserved the glorious roar of appreciation reserved for such match-winning moments.</p>
<p>And Arsenal&rsquo;s players deserved to walk up Wembley&rsquo;s steps to receive the trophy, rather than having to receive their medals on the pitch.</p>
<p>Media playback is not supported on this device &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t even talk&rsquo; - Martinez in tears after FA Cup win</p>
<p>Aubameyang deserved that small ovation as he made his way back to the dressing room because he was the focal point of an Arsenal performance and success that makes it a superb start for manager Arteta, who only succeeded Unai Emery in December and had to deal with a three-month break in the season.</p>
<p>What they must do now is put together a package attractive enough to make sure Aubameyang is also part of future successes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A day of huge significance for Arteta&rsquo;</p>
<p>Arsenal will want to do business this summer to shape the new era under Arteta - but the most crucial business above all is keeping Aubameyang.</p>
<p>The wins over Premier League champions Liverpool and against last season&rsquo;s FA Cup winners Manchester City in the semi-final showed previously well-hidden reserves of steel and character from this Arsenal side.</p>
<p>They were on show here as they took the early blow of Christian Pulisic&rsquo;s goal on the chin and pieced together a display that allowed them to recover and deservedly just edge this game.</p>
<p>It was a day of huge significance for Arteta.</p>
<p>He has tangible reward for his work early in his reign, during which Arsenal&rsquo;s players have bought into his methods and he has demonstrated ruthlessly that it is his way or no way by the manner in which Mesut Ozil and Matteo Guendouzi have been exiled. The pair were nowhere near this occasion or celebrations and appear to have no part to play under the new regime.</p>
<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang wheels away in celebration after hitting Arsenal&rsquo;s winner against Chelsea</p>
<p>It should also be said that much of the things that could go wrong for Chelsea did go wrong, from injuries to captain Cesar Azpilicueta and Pulisic to a second yellow card for Mateo Kovacic that looked to be a totally mystifying decision from referee Anthony Taylor.</p>
<p>Yes, this was a surreal day - but set that aside and Arsenal and their young manager, crowning his first season with the perfect conclusion, will start the new campaign with optimism renewed and a trophy to parade after this landmark triumph.

Arsenal added another Emirates FA Cup title to their record haul, after a Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang double sealed a 2-1 victory over Chelsea in the Final at Wembley.</p>
<p>The Gunners came into the Heads Up FA Cup Final with 13 titles to their name and this victory nudges the north Londoners further ahead in what was their 21st Final appearance, another Cup record.</p>
<p>While Wembley remained empty ‚Äì the first time there‚Äôs been no crowd at an FA Cup Final in 132 attempts ‚Äì the cheers from the Arsenal team and staff as they collected the Cup on the pitch made this perhaps the most unique title of their lot.</p>
<p>Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea Heads Up FA Cup Final</p>
<p>Saturday 1 August 2020</p>
<p>Wembley Stadium connected by EE</p>
<p>It was a first managerial honour for boss Mikel Arteta with the Spaniard having only returned to the club in January to take over from compatriot Unai Emery and having previously captained the club to one of those Cup victories back in 2014, he becomes the first man to both captain and manage an Arsenal team to an FA Cup title.</p>
<p>And Arteta can take plenty of credit in how his side ended what‚Äôs been an unprecedented campaign in football following the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as his team stuck rigidly to their game plan and exploited Chelsea in all the right areas to seal victory against their London rivals.</p>
<p>They had to show their resolve too, as it was Chelsea who started the game with a flourish and could easily have been two goals ahead within ten minutes.</p>
<p>Frank Lampard&rsquo;s side began the game with bite and deservedly edged ahead after just five minutes through Christian Pulisic.</p>
<p>After collecting the ball from Reece James just inside the Arsenal half, the American threaded a pass through to Mason Mount on the left and when Mount‚Äôs low centre was back-heeled by Olivier Giroud in the box, Pulisic was there to pick it up and clip home past Emiliano Martinez.</p>

<p>Pulisic then stung the hands of Martinez moments later with a fierce strike from the edge of the area, as the Blues looked to build on their early advantage.</p>
<p>Arsenal rode the storm out and with Arteta vocally guiding his men from the sidelines, they soon turned the tide and the game back in their favour.</p>
<p>Nicolas Pepe had already seen a wonderful strike into the top corner ruled out for an earlier offside, and it wasn‚Äôt long after that when they drew level.</p>
<p>As per Arteta‚Äôs touchline call out, the Gunners took advantage of Chelsea‚Äôs high defensive line, as Kieran Tierney‚Äôs pass forward for Aubameyang saw the Arsenal captain outpace Cesar Azpilicueta and race into the box, only to be felled by the Blues captain.</p>
<p>Aubameyang remained calm to clinically slot home the resulting spot kick and ensure an entertaining first half ended all square.</p>
<p>Expand Mikel Arteta and Frank Lampard both appeal a decision from the sidelines at Wembley</p>
<p>Azpilicueta‚Äôs evening was brought to an early end shortly after that in a further blow to Lampard, himself looking for a first managerial honour, as the Spaniard limped off injured.</p>
<p>Chelsea were forced into another reshuffle early in the second half when dangerman Pulisic pulled up injured while running at the Arsenal defence and had to be helped off the pitch before he was replaced by Pedro.</p>
<p>It was midway through the second half when Arsenal edged ahead for the first time in the game, as Hector Bellerin‚Äôs driving run into the Chelsea half had the Blues back-pedalling.</p>
<p>The ball was released to Pepe, who slid a pass across the box for Aubameyang and after gleefully beating a committed Kurt Zouma, he calmly clipped a left-footed finish over Willy Caballero to add his second of the game.</p>
<p>Chelsea‚Äôs hopes of a response were further dashed with 15 minutes to go when Mateo Kovacic collected his second caution of the game, both for fouls on Granit Zhaka, and was duly sent off.</p>
<p>Ross Barkley, Tammy Abraham and Callum Hudson-Odoi were all introduced by Chelsea after that in a bid to claw their way back into the tie, but Arsenal never allowed their guard down and comfortably saw out the game to seal their moment.</p>
<p>For Arteta and his squad, the victory secures European football at the Emirates Stadium next season as well as another Wembley appearance at the end of the month for the Community Shield on Saturday 29 August.</p>

<h3 id="keep-poaching---fans-react-as-ghana-fa-congratulate-arsenal-fa-cup-winner-nketiah">&ldquo;&lsquo;Keep poaching&rsquo; - Fans react as Ghana FA &lsquo;congratulate&rsquo; Arsenal FA Cup winner Nketiah&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png" alt="img">
&lsquo;Keep poaching&rsquo; - Fans react as Ghana FA &lsquo;congratulate&rsquo; Arsenal FA Cup winner Nketiah</p>
<p>There were interesting reactions as the African nation&rsquo;s football governing body sent out a message following Saturday&rsquo;s victory over Chelsea</p>
<p>Supporters are speculating that the national team could be aiming to persuade Eddie Nketiah to switch international allegiances after the African nation&rsquo;s football association sent him a congratulatory message after Arsenal&rsquo;s final victory.</p>
<p>under-21s striker Nketiah, who is of Ghanaian descent, won his second major title in two months as the Gunners beat 2-1 to at Wembley on Saturday.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old saw eight minutes of action as a late substitute, after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang&rsquo;s double ensured a comeback victory, Christian Pulisic having given the Blues an early lead.</p>
<p>The title, which secured Arsenal a place in the 2020-21 , was Nketiah&rsquo;s second of the 2019-20 season as he spent the first part of the campaign with , who ultimately won the English Championship to seal a comeback to the Premier League.</p>
<p>Born to Ghanaian parents in London, the forward looks to be on the radar of the African nation who could be hoping to convince him to play for Ghana at senior level after coming through the various youth sides of England, from U18s up to the U21s.</p>
<p>On Saturday night, the Ghana Football Association (GFA) appeared to indicate their interest in the player with a congratulatory social media message on his latest feat.</p>
<p>The tweet has generated a lot of reactions, with many Ghanaian football fans excited about a hot Premier League talent being added to their ranks, although others suggested Nketiah would be better swerving the Black Stars and sticking with the Three Lions.</p>
<p>This is a beautiful gesture from the FA, I don&rsquo;t care decision came from the top or just the handle user, is a great move. We can&rsquo;t sit idle and lose some good prospects ledt and right, pls for the good of blackstars keep poaching ‚Äî Nana Boateng (@jaylanikojo) August 1, 2020</p>

<p>Nketiah has impressed at youth level with England, scoring eight goals in as many appearances for the U21 international side.</p>
<p>At club level he has broken into the first team picture this season with Arsenal since manager Mikel Arteta took over at the end of 2019 and decided to recall the forward from his loan at Elland Road.</p>
<p>Nketiah made 16 appearances for Arsenal in the second half of 2019-20, scoring four goals.</p>
<p>He has already turned down one approach from Ghana to be called up to their senior international side, pledging his allegiance to England in January 2019 when asked by former national team manager James Kwesi Appiah.
