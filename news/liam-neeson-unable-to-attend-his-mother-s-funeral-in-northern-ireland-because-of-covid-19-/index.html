<p>LIAM NEESON was unable to attend his beloved mother’s funeral in Northern Ireland this week, local reports say.</p>
<p>Katherine ‘Kitty’ Neeson passed away last Saturday, aged 94, after being ill for several months.</p>
<p>The much-loved mother-of-four died at a nursing home where she lived, just one day shy of the Taken actor’s 67th birthday.</p>
<p>The Hollywood star had been expected to travel from New York back to his hometown of Ballymena, where his mother lived, to attend her funeral this past Monday.</p>
<p>However, according to The Belfast Telegraph, Neeson appeared to have not been able to make the long trip, with no signs of the Star Wars actor at the service.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The reasons for Liam’s absence are unknown though the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and travel restrictions in place around much of the world could well have been a major factor.</p>
<p>Despite her son’s absence, Katherine enjoyed as good a send-off as Northern Ireland’s social distancing rules could allow for.</p>
<p>A private service only attended by close friends and family, Liam’s sisters Elizabeth and Bernadette were among those in attendance while as many as 100 mourners took to the streets of Ballymena to pay tribute to a woman who will be fondly remembered by the local community.</p>
<p>Described as a “lovely lady adored by many”, Katherine was fondly remembered as a dinner lady at the local St Louis School.</p>
<p>Kitty was married to school caretaker Bernard ‘Barney’ Neeson who, together had four children; Liam and three daughters named Elizabeth, Bernadette and Rosaleen.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her son’s remarkable career and success in the late 1990s, Kitty recalled: &ldquo;He was such a quiet lad, I never knew it would turn out like this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love people. I love talking. Not like Liam. He got his quiet ways from his father.&rdquo;

Mourners lined the streets of Ballymena yesterday to pay respects to the mother of Hollywood star Liam Neeson.</p>
<p>Waterford-born Catherine &lsquo;Kitty&rsquo; Neeson passed away peacefully at the age of 94 on Saturday in Slemish Nursing Home after being ill for some months.</p>
<p>A family notice described her as the beloved wife of the late Barney, who died in 1988, and mother to Elizabeth, Bernadette, Liam and Rosaleen, as well as a devoted grandmother and great-grandmother.</p>
<p>A private funeral service was held by parish priest Monsignor Paddy Delargy in Henry&rsquo;s Funeral Home on Broughshane Street in the Co Antrim town.</p>
<p>The funeral cortege then proceeded to Ballymena Cemetery, where Mrs Neeson&rsquo;s late husband is buried.</p>
<p>With social distancing in place, around 100 people stood along the street to show support for the family.</p>

<p>It had been reported her actor son had hoped to make the journey from New York to attend despite restrictions on travel caused by Covid-19.</p>
<p>While he was ultimately unable to attend, sisters Elizabeth and Bernadette were among the close family present.</p>
<p>Mayor of Mid and East Antrim Peter Johnston issued a statement of condolence over the weekend and promised to raise it at last night&rsquo;s full council meeting with a minute&rsquo;s silence.</p>
<p>Others passed on their tributes, including the Services Club in Ballymena, where she had been a popular bridge player on Wednesday evenings.</p>
<p>A statement from the Lyric Theatre in Belfast, of which her son was a patron, called her &ldquo;a tremendous lady and friend&rdquo;.</p>
<p>North Antrim DUP MP Ian Paisley commented on Facebook: &ldquo;I had the pleasure of meeting Kitty many times and when Liam was awarded Freeman of Ballymena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to express my condolences to Liam and the rest of the family circle at this sad time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ballymena newsagent Eugene Diamond said that he would remember her as &ldquo;a lovely lady&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mrs Neeson had been well-known to many former pupils of St Louis Grammar School in the town, where she had worked in the canteen for many years, with her husband working as a caretaker.</p>
<p>While she was pleasantly surprised by her shy son&rsquo;s success as an actor, Mrs Neeson had always been a natural &lsquo;people person&rsquo; and was photographed over the years with many famous faces, including Pogues singer Shane MacGowan, actors Jeremy Irons, Gabriel Byrne and Sir Roger Moore, and Nobel prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney.</p>
<p>Speaking after receiving an award on her son&rsquo;s behalf in Dublin in 1998, Mrs Neeson said: &ldquo;He was such a quiet lad, I never knew it would turn out like this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love people. I love talking. Not like Liam. He got his quiet ways from his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On her surprise at his career, she said: &ldquo;He went to university but that didn&rsquo;t suit him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know much about it when he started acting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I know is that he works very hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2013 Mrs Neeson was by his side as he returned to be given the freedom of his home town. The loss of the actor&rsquo;s mother follows the death of his wife Natasha Richardson as the result of a tragic skiing accident in Canada in 2009.</p>
<p>His nephew Ronan Sexton also passed away last year in Cushendall, five years after suffering a serious injury when he fell from the top of a telephone kiosk.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn2.ettoday.net/images/4955/d4955327.jpg" alt="img">
記者洪文／綜合報導</p>
<p>20世紀影業（原：福斯影業）《金牌特務》前傳電影《金牌特務：金士曼起源》（The King&rsquo;s Man）在台灣時間22日深夜12點20分公布正式預告，不僅呈現更多爆炸場面以及動作場面，還有金士曼的起源背景故事，同時也揭開本片的反派角色，包括俄國獨裁者拉斯普丁也在反派陣營，戲分吃重，而背後大魔王僅以「光頭」背影現身，受到網友熱烈討論。</p>
<p>▲▼ 牛津公爵向兒子談輪世界崩壞的內幕，並解密金士曼的起源。（圖／翻攝自YouTube／二十世紀影業，以下同）</p>
<p>請繼續往下閱讀&hellip;</p>
<p>預告當中，牛頓公爵兒子在片中有愛國熱忱：「世界崩壞，你不能讓我獨善其身！」牛頓公爵則說：「兒子，實情是這世界，被腐敗、貪婪所統治」，後來兒子又說：「我們得做些什麼！」他立刻把家中密門打開來，兒子瞬間呆掉，後來他又解釋：「我們是首個獨立情報組織，優雅但殘忍，文明卻無情」</p>
<p>至於反派，早在預告一開始就有一桌人士，包括拉斯普丁也坐在其中，而大魔王應該就是一個光頭背影，他向其他人喊著：「夥伴們，這不會是場光榮之戰，國家互相殘殺，而我們從中致富。」接著，他說：「接下來可精彩。」按下按鈕之後，整艘潛水艇立刻爆炸，不過畫面並未揭曉光頭者的真實身分，許多網友認為應該是馬修古迪（Matthew Goode）演出Tristan。</p>
<p>▲▼ 大反派僅以「光頭」背影現身，而拉斯普丁也是反派陣營的人物。（圖／翻攝自YouTube／二十世紀影業）</p>

<p>另外，小鮮肉男主角哈里斯迪金森（Harris Dickinson）演出Conrad，還有「快銀」亞倫強森（Aaron Taylor-Johnson）演出Lee Unwi，以及《唐頓莊園》馬修古迪（Matthew Goode）演出Tristan、《飢餓遊戲》史丹利圖奇（Stanley Tucci）演出Merlin。</p>
<p>《金牌特務：金士曼起源》由一手打造《金牌特務》的王牌名導馬修范恩親自執導，帶領大家探索偉大的「金士曼」首個獨立情報機構的起源，故事描述史上最殘暴的暴君與犯罪主謀齊聚一堂，密謀策劃一場足以讓世上數百萬人斷命的血腥戰爭時，一位偉大的紳士挺身而出，憑藉著他兒子的幫助、可靠的助手，以及風格極致的裝備，他們將分秒必爭地阻止這場悲劇發生，而這就是「金牌特務」的誕生。</p>
<p>《金牌特務：金士曼起源》將在2020年9月18日上映。

<p>至於反派，早在預告一開始就有一桌人士，包括拉斯普丁也坐在其中，而大魔王應該就是一個光頭背影，他向其他人喊著：「夥伴們，這不會是場光榮之戰，國家互相殘殺，而我們從中致富。」接著，他說：「接下來可精彩。」按下按鈕之後，整艘潛水艇立刻爆炸，不過畫面並未揭曉光頭者的真實身分，許多網友認為應該是馬修古迪（Matthew Goode）演出Tristan。</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Liam-Neeson-Sweetest-Quotes-About-Wife-Natasha-Richardson-10.jpg?crop=2px%2C31px%2C1339px%2C703px&amp;resize=1200%2C630&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
The love of a lifetime. Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson’s relationship was something right out of a movie — and although Richardson passed away in 2009, Neeson has never stopped singing her praises.</p>
<p>The Taken actor and Parent Trap star met in 1993 while working on Broadway’s Anna Christie. At the time, Richardson was married to producer Robert Fox, but her chemistry with the Northern Ireland native was undeniable to them both.</p>
<p>Although Richardson called the beginning of her relationship with Neeson “bad timing” since her marriage was coming to an end simultaneously, she didn’t let it affect their future.</p>
<p>“Obviously I fell very much in love with him,” the Cabaret star, who ended her marriage to Fox shortly after the show closed, told the Daily News in an interview published in March 2009.</p>
<p>She also revealed that Neeson’s history of being a ladies’ man didn’t matter to her. “I’m pleased that women fall in love with him, because I know why,” Richardson said.</p>
<p>Their whirlwind romance took off after Richardson flew to Poland while Neeson was shooting Schindler’s List, following her receiving a birthday card from the actor.</p>
<p>Upon returning to the U.S., the pair bought a farmhouse in upstate New York and in July 1994 they tied the knot on their property. The Asylum actress surprised her groom with a serenade of their wedding song, “Crazy Love” by Van Morrison during the festivities.</p>
<p>In December 1994, the newlyweds’ first joint movie, Nell, hit theaters and six months later they became parents, welcoming their son Micheál in June 2015. Their son Daniel was born the following year.</p>
<p>Tragedy, however, struck in March 2009, when the British actress fell coming down a beginner slope on Mont Tremblant while on a ski vacation in Québec, Canada, with the couple’s oldest son. She hit her head without a helmet on and was brought back to her room after reportedly turning down medical attention.</p>
<p>“I spoke to her and she said, ‘Oh, darling, I’ve taken a tumble in the snow.’ That’s how she described it,” Neeson recalled during a 2014 interview with Anderson Cooper for 60 Minutes.</p>
<p>Although she felt OK to start, the actress had suffered a traumatic brain injury during her fall and was later taken to the hospital in Montreal. When her husband arrived, he was told that she was brain dead and on life support.</p>
<p>“I went in to her and told her I loved her,” the Love Actually star explained. “[I] said, ‘Sweetie, you’re not coming back from this. You’ve banged your head. It’s — I don’t know if you can hear me, but that’s — this is what’s gone down. And we’re bringing ya back to New York. All your family and friends will come.’ And that was more or less it.”</p>
<p>Since her death on March 18, 2009, Neeson has kept himself busy with work and kept relatively quiet about his loss. When he has spoken about his love, it’s been with fondness for what they had together for 15 years.</p>
<p>“They say the hardest thing in the world is losing someone you love,” the father of two said in a Facebook post in 2016. “My wife died unexpectedly. She brought me so much joy. She was my everything.”</p>
<p>Scroll down to see everything Neeson has said about his late wife and their life together before her untimely death.
