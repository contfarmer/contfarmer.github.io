<p>(CNN) Bindi Irwin, the 22-year-old daughter of the late conservationist and television personality Steve Irwin, has announced she is expecting her first child.</p>
<p>Nearly five months after her wedding to Chandler Powell, Irwin shared the news of her pregnancy on Tuesday, writing on Instagram: &ldquo;Baby Wildlife Warrior due 2021.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chandler and I are proud to announce that we&rsquo;re expecting! It&rsquo;s an honour to share this special moment in our lives with you,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though I&rsquo;m still in my first trimester, we really want you to be part of our journey from the beginning of this new life chapter,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Irwin, a passionate conservationist like her late father, married Powell in March in the gardens of Australia Zoo in Queensland. The venue was opened by her grandparents in the 1970s and is still run by the Irwin family.</p>

<p>“He loves wildlife and conservation and he has this strength. Which is necessary when you’re jumping on crocs.”</p>
<p>Bindi’s late father, Steve, was a nature nut and an internationally known figure. He was killed by a stingray barb through the chest in 2006 while shooting an underwater documentary film in his native Australia. The cameraman with Irwin at the time claimed the popular TV personality was stung “hundreds of times.”</p>

<p>March 25th 2020 ❤️ We held a small ceremony and I married my best friend. There are no words to describe the amount of love and light in my heart right now. We’ve planned this beautiful day for nearly a year and had to change everything, as we didn’t have guests at our wedding. This was a very difficult decision but important to keep everyone safe. We wish all of our friends and family could have been there with us, however it’s lovely that we will be able to share photos and videos. Right now we’re encouraging the world to hold onto hope and love, which will carry us forward during this profound time in history. Today we celebrated life and revelled in every beautiful moment we shared together in our Australia Zoo gardens. Mum helped me get ready, Robert walked me down the aisle, Chandler became my husband and together we lit a candle in Dad’s memory. We shared tears and smiles and love. Thankfully, since we all live at Australia Zoo as a family, we could be there for each other. To everyone reading this - stay safe, social distance and remember LOVE WINS!

Wildlife warrior Bindi Irwin announced she and husband Chandler Powell are expecting their first child this week.</p>
<p>And the 22-year-old shared a special post for her new arrival&rsquo;s &lsquo;grandparents&rsquo; on Instagram on Thursday.</p>
<p>Bindi gushed over her famous mother Terri and Chandler&rsquo;s parents: &lsquo;Grandparent appreciation post,&rsquo; she began, adding a heart emoji.</p>
<p>Loving: Bindi Irwin has shared a touching dedication to her baby&rsquo;s &lsquo;grandparents&rsquo; in an intimate post on Instagram on Thursday. Pictured here with husband Chandler Powell</p>
<p>She continued: &lsquo;My beautiful mum and Chandler&rsquo;s parents. Our little one is going to be so loved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The photograph saw Bindi and Chandler smiling widely as they held out a turtle while standing on boat.</p>
<p>Terri looked thrilled as she smiled while standing next to daughter, Bindi.</p>
<p>Beautiful: &lsquo;My beautiful mum and Chandler&rsquo;s parents. Our little one is going to be so loved&rsquo;</p>
<p>Chandler&rsquo;s parents looked equally excited with broad smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>Bindi and Chandler announced they are expecting their first child on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Shortly after they shared the exciting news, the 22-year-old wildlife warrior&rsquo;s mother, Terri, posted a heartfelt message on Twitter.</p>
<p>Father: Bindi is the daughter of the famous Crocodile Hunter, Steve Irwin, who died in 2006</p>
<p>The Irwin matriarch, 56, uploaded a photo of the expectant couple holding up a tiny version of the Australia Zoo uniform, and also told her followers that the news was bittersweet following her husband Steve&rsquo;s death almost 14 years ago.</p>
<p>She began: &lsquo;This is the best day ever! I am over the moon to announce that @BindiIrwin and @chandlerpowell9 are going to have a baby!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Words cannot express the love that is filling my heart. While I wish that Steve was here to share this beautiful moment, I know that he would be so proud,&rsquo; she added.

When Bindi Irwin and Chandler Powell swapped vows in March, the couple did so without guests in attendance due to the coronavirus pandemic. Only Irwin’s brother was there to walk her down the aisle, her mother to help her prepare for the ceremony and an officiant to lead the “I dos&rdquo; at the family’s Australia Zoo.</p>
<p>Still, there was one person whose absence stood out more than any other. The father of the bride, Steve Irwin, couldn’t be there because he died 14 years earlier.</p>
<p>But thanks to one talented fan, he’s in the wedding-party portrait all the same.</p>
<p>Trending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha</p>
<p>Bindi recently shared a shot of the family gathered around the image created by digital artist Debb Oliver, in which the late “Crocodile Hunter” can be seen standing in the center of the group — right in between his daughter and his widow, Terri Irwin.</p>
<p>“Thank you (Debb) for creating this spectacular piece,” the newlywed wrote alongside the photo. She also included a quote from poet Thomas Campbell that read, “To live in hearts we leave behind is not to die.”</p>
<p>As for the artist, who used her Instagram account to reach out to the family and offer them the piece, she first showcased the digital painting on her account back in July.</p>
<p>“I’ve been working on this slowly since @bindisueirwin and @chandlerpowell got married,” Oliver wrote at the time. “I couldn’t stop thinking about how Steve would be so proud of them. So I wanted to draw all the Irwins together, including Sui. Steve’s (dog and) best friend. I LOVE this family so much. And I’d love for them to see this. I promise I won’t ask every time, but I’d REALLY appreciate if you could help me get this to them.”</p>
<p>Her followers came through, and it wasn’t long before the Irwins were in touch.</p>
<p>“Words can’t express how much your beautiful art piece means to our family,” Bindi wrote in a thank-you card Oliver shared just days later. “We can’t wait to see it in real life.”</p>
<p>The card also featured a “crikey!” and a “thank you” from the entire crew of Australia Zoo, and it was all accompanied by zoo gifts and autographs. And soon enough, Oliver had the chance to give her work to the family in person — in a socially distanced hand-off.</p>
<p>The Irwin family was obviously grateful to get a chance to see the famous patriarch standing alongside them at the nuptials — especially since they believe he was there on the big day.</p>
<p>As Bindi’s brother Robert Irwin told Australia’s “The Today Show” in April, “It was a day that you definitely wish that Dad was there for it, but I think he was definitely there with us in spirit.”</p>
<p>Terri agreed, noting in the same interview, “I think we all felt that Steve was watching over us.”
