<p>While Dufy got his start as a watercolorist, his polychromatic practice evolved over his 50-year-career. Whether dabbling in design, exploring the decorative arts, or even experimenting with monumental mural-making, the French artist found inspiration in a subject close to his heart: the colorful joie de vivre of contemporary France.</p>
<p>Impressionist Beginnings</p>
<p>During his time at the École des Beaux-Arts, Dufy was mostly inspired by Impressionism, a movement that forewent realism for fleeting impressions of everyday life. Thus, he worked mostly in watercolor and looked to local Norman land and seascapes for inspiration. “Unhappy the man who lives far from the sea,” he said. “The painter needs constantly to have before his eyes a certain type of light, a glittering quality, an aerial caress that bathes what he sees.”</p>
<p>Given his proximity to Paris’ top turn-of-the-century artists, it is no wonder that, in 1905, Dufy decided to focus his efforts toward an exciting new French movement: Fauvism.</p>
<p>Fauvism</p>
<p>In 1910, Dufy adopted a more muted color palette inspired by the Post-Impressionist paintings of Paul Cézanne. By the end of the decade, however, he found his way back to Fauvism—and developed his characteristic, career-defining style.</p>
<p>Later Years and Legacy</p>
<p>Dufy dabbled in different materials for the remainder of his career. This eclectic approach culminated in a body of work comprising fanciful ceramics, bold woodcuts, stylish set designs, eye-catching tapestries, and even monumental murals, like the 6,500-square-foot fresco, La Fée Électricité. He also continued honing his textile talents, adding a 16-year stint with Lyon-based silk manufacturer Bianchini-Férier to his repertoire.</p>
<p>won the International Grand Prize for Painting at the 26th Venice Biennale in 1952)—he died in 1953.</p>
<p>Now, nearly 70 years after his death, Dufy remains a celebrated modern artist. Though his Fauvist paintings often take enter stage, his textile designs have also found a place in the spotlight, thanks to recent exhibitions like Poiret: King of Fashion (2007) at New York City’s Metropolitan Museum of Art and Raoul Dufy: Paintings and Textile Designs (2019) at the Panasonic Shiodome Museum of Art in Tokyo.</p>

<p>French artist Henri Matisse had once let on that creativity takes courage, while according to German-American writer Charles Bukowski this courage was to come from the belly. But will any art remain if the belly is empty? Artistes would rather die than beg, and the COVID-19 pandemic has ensured both. The lack of work and deteriorating financial situation compelled artistes to take extreme steps. TV actors Manmeet Grewal (Kuldeepak) and Preksha Mehta (Crime Patrol) committed suicide. Ashiesh Roy (Sasural Simar Ka) checked out of a hospital because he couldn’t afford dialysis. Solanki Diwakar (Dream Girl) was seen selling mangoes in Mumbai’s Bandra. And Agneepath 2 and Mangal Pandey actor Rajesh Kareer put out a video on Facebook asking for Rs 300-500 to go back to his hometown in Punjab to find some work.</p>
<p>As some European governments announced bailout packages for artistes, in India, the lot was bypassed in the Rs 20-lakh-crore economic-stimulus package that was enumerated by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last month. The pandemic, which has gone on for a while, has forced them to stare at the gaping chasm between the haves and the have-nots, even within the community. Event and Entertainment Management Association president Sanjoy Roy was stumped at a Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry meet when he was asked why artistes needed money, that they should instead donate to the government. Roy said he had to explain to them that not every artiste is a Shah Rukh Khan or Sonu Nigam, millions languish in obscurity, from the Bauls, Manganiyars, patachitra painters, craftsmen, and puppeteers, among others. In rural India, families are dependent on the arts and crafts as primary means of livelihood, and as a secondary mode of income, especially in the agrarian communities. Like the Adivasis in Odisha’s Sadeibareni village who make and sell dokra (bell metal) art in between the two paddy-harvest seasons.</p>

<p>While a plethora of artistes has come forward to help, Roy-led Teamwork Fine Arts Society through its new initiative #ArtMatters, with more than 100 industry leaders and artistes on board, is trying to reach out to the artistes in dire straits. Channelled through its partner organisations across states, it has helped seven craftsmen’s families for a month, provided ration packets to 50 families in a Jaisalmer village, deposited Rs 6,000 for a month’s household expenditure to five (including a folk musician, sattriya dancer and weaver) in Assam’s Jorhat and Majuli, and Rs 10,000 to tabla teacher Ananta Bora who has a kidney-stone operation coming up. With the help of Kyssa Farms, it has provided 6.3 tonnes of vegetables and grains for the puppeteers and magicians in Delhi’s Kathputli Colony and fundraised for folk artistes like Jaisalmer’s Chugge Khan (of the Manganiyar collective Rajasthan Josh). They are also shooting a concert film, to be out in July, where popular musicians like Kailash Kher and Shekhar Ravjiani will interview folk artistes across the length and breadth of the country.</p>
<p>“The world was moved by the migrant workers walking homewards, but there’s also a huge section of people who are equally anonymous, equally without their voices to articulate and lobby against their plight,” said Dastkar founder Laila Tyabji in the recent #ArtMatters virtual meet, moderated by Roy. The other panellists included Dadi Pudumjee, Ishara Puppet Theatre founder and president of UNIMA (Union Internationale de la Marionnette, which celebrates its 90th year this year, with presence in 91 countries), Kathak dancer Aditi Mangaldas, and Jehan Manekshaw, founder-director of Theatre Professionals (he acted in Dhobi Ghat).</p>
<p>“The craftspeople don’t fit into the MSME category, which the government is, I believe, going to support. They are out of the security blanket, have no salaries, provident funds, or insurance. Now they don’t have the market, most of their orders have been cancelled. Even after the lockdown is lifted, people won’t rush to open bazaars and haats to buy the ‘non-essential’ crafts. While we have to sell the stock they already have since their orders have been cancelled, perhaps, try a ‘pay now, get later’ scheme online, we have to think of an alternative,” said Tyabji, whose four-decade-old Dastkar has provided supplies to 2,000 families across 11 states during the lockdown. Talking about the need for a database for all artistes and artisans, she said that unlike “the government figure of 10-11 million craftspeople, our findings estimate about 200 million people – including the craftsperson’s families and ancillary workers.”</p>

<p>“In the performing arts: theatre, dance, puppetry, music, etc., the Akademi already has a huge database,” added Pudumjee, the past member of the general council of the Sangeet Natak Akademi, “If they are not being able to use it, then there’s something wrong.”</p>
<p>During the discussion Pudumjee spoke about puppeteer groups in West Bengal – their mudhouses washed out by the recent cyclone – have been reaching out to Ishara Trust. “The Akademi needs to reach out and help, which is their mandate,” he adds, “They are trying to do webinars, etc., but what is that getting into the individual artiste’s pocket?” he asked. “No money is coming from the Akademi, from the Ministry of Culture. Artistes who have salary/production grants, who have come for review to Delhi in the last two-three years, some of them still haven’t got that money. Maybe if that is released, those groups can get some sustenance.”</p>
<p>Malwa tradition Kabir folk singer Kaluram Bamaniya received a call from SPIC MACAY a few days ago assuring him of his pending payment of Rs 25,000-30,000 from shows in January. With the opening up of religious places, his performances might also resume soon.</p>
<p>ALSO READ | Performing arts in the hot zone: Covid 19 leaves many artistes gasping for relief</p>
<p>Mangaldas, however, isn’t hopeful. “Auditoriums and theatres will be the last places to open, not two-three months, it will take years, what dance is going to remain within?” she asked. Adding how individual artistes like Shubha Mudgal, Milind Srivastava, TM Krishna have come forward to help, she urged the academies to step in. “We are the people who are sent as the country’s heritage and culture ambassadors, where are you now when we need you? What is the Sangeet Natak Akademi doing with its funds allocated for festivals? What is the ICCR (Indian Council for Cultural Relations) doing with the funds that is meant to send troupes abroad?” asked Mangaldas, who has collaborated with a Swiss museum, a theatre, and currently with Raw Mango to raise funds. “We are not begging. We are offering artistic experiences. The few art initiatives online – by privileged artistes like us – are only keeping sanity for a few, rest are decimated, there’s no food, no performances in the next year. Hundreds of classical dancers don’t have internet access, a laptop, smartphones,” she said.</p>
<p>Manekshaw and other theatrewallahs have been trying to raise funds to help theatre artistes – not just the virtuosos, but the stagehands, sound, lights and props people, tailors, dressmakers, etc. He isn’t optimistic about the government’s “ability to respond” adequately, adding that his greatest learning in this pandemic/lockdown has been “how not to keep all our eggs in one basket”.</p>

<h3 id="legacy-gift-features-women-artists-picasso-matisse">&ldquo;Legacy gift features women artists, Picasso, Matisse&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.wm.edu/news/images/2020/thumbnails/gift720.jpg" alt="img">
Stepping into the New York City home of Sybil Shainwald ’48, LL.D. ’19 next to Central Park is like entering a museum.</p>
<p>“You’re immediately aware of being surrounded by art,” says David Brashear, interim director of Muscarelle Museum of Art at William &amp; Mary. “As you move from room to room, you begin to understand that not only is it an exquisite presentation of art, but there’s also a strong collecting thread that works through it.”</p>
<p>The list of artists represented is jaw-dropping: There are drawings by Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso; photographs by Richard Avedon, Man Ray and Helen Levitt; sculptures by Louise Nevelson and Henry Moore; charcoal on paper works by Willem de Kooning; a surrealist painting by Dorothea Tanning.</p>
<p>Those are just a few of the 100 works of art that Shainwald has decided to donate via her estate to William &amp; Mary. Upon viewing the art, a theme quickly emerges — nearly all the pieces portray women, and many were created by female artists.</p>
<p>“At the time I started collecting, I thought that women artists and their work were undervalued and underrepresented,” Shainwald says. That is changing and this transformative gift puts William &amp; Mary in a position to accelerate that positive change.</p>
<p>Advocate for Women</p>
<p>Shainwald’s approach to collecting is consistent with a storied legal career devoted to women’s health cases. Since receiving her law degree in 1976, she has fought for justice on behalf of thousands of women harmed by products such as breast implants, contraceptives and drugs given to pregnant women at risk of miscarriage — both in the United States and in developing countries around the globe. Shainwald’s achievements have drawn accolades from William &amp; Mary, Columbia University’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, New York Law School and the New York County Lawyers Association, among others.</p>
<p>“When the history of women’s health in the second half of the 20th century is written, Sybil Shainwald will be right in the middle of that history,” W&amp;M Law School Dean Davison Douglas says in a video tribute for the pioneering social justice advocate, who received an honorary doctor of laws degree from the university in 2019. “She has had an extraordinary impact on women’s health through her work as an attorney.”</p>
<p>Shainwald’s observation about art by women being undervalued and underrepresented remains as compelling today as it was when she started collecting art in the 1950s.</p>
<p>A survey of 18 major U.S. museums published by the Public Library of Science journal PLOS ONE in March 2019 found that 87% of the works in their permanent collections are by male artists. And despite increased attention to the gender imbalance, the numbers don’t appear to be moving swiftly in a more equitable direction. According to data released in September by Artnet News and the In Other Words podcast, works by women represent just 11% of art acquired by museums over the past decade.</p>
<p>Melissa Parris, director of collections and exhibitions at the Muscarelle, says that art by women comprises about 25% of Shainwald’s collection. Incorporating those into the museum’s holdings not only will increase the number of works by women, but also will spotlight artists who are not currently represented at the Muscarelle, such as Joan Mitchell, Dorothea Tanning, Lynda Benglis and Lisette Model.</p>
<p>Planned gifts such as this one are an important part of the university’s For the Bold campaign, comprising one third of the total raised to date. They also demonstrate a strong commitment by alumni and friends to invest in William &amp; Mary’s future.</p>
<p>“Sybil Shainwald’s extraordinary gift will forever change the representation of women artists in the university’s collections,” says W&amp;M President Katherine Rowe. “She shines as a brilliant litigator and a visionary art collector. We are incredibly grateful to her for entrusting William &amp; Mary with this transformative collection.”</p>
<p>With an expansion planned for the Muscarelle’s facility, Brashear envisions eventually displaying Shainwald’s collection in its entirety as an exhibition of art by and about women. He says the museum is also talking with Shainwald about loaning a few pieces in the meantime as a preview and celebration of her gift.</p>
<p>A Forward-Thinking Collection</p>
<p>Among the first works of art Shainwald purchased was an abstract female figure by French-born sculptor Louise Bourgeois. Shainwald’s husband, Sidney, was not thrilled.</p>
<p>“He said, ‘I don’t really like that sculpture,’ ” she recalls. “I said, ‘Well you’ll learn to love it if you look at it long enough.’ ”</p>
<p>Sidney Shainwald, a prominent consumer advocate and certified public accountant who died in 2003, may not have learned to love all of the pieces his wife bought, but his devotion to her held strong throughout their 42-year marriage. During that time, she earned a graduate degree in history from Columbia University, then a law degree from New York Law School — after Columbia declined to admit her into its law program, saying she’d take the place of a man who would practice law for 40 years — then embarked on a decades-long legal career.</p>
<p>U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who, like Sybil Shainwald, faced gender discrimination in pursuing a law career and has been a strong advocate for women, noticed a similarity between the Shainwalds’ relationship and her own marriage to Martin Ginsburg. Both women had attended James Madison High School in Brooklyn, although Ginsburg is several years younger, and they met through a shared passion for opera. Two years ago, Ginsburg spoke at the Sidney Shainwald Public Interest Lecture Series, which Sybil founded in her late husband’s honor, at New York Law School.</p>
<p>“Afterward, she said, ‘Come have a cup of coffee with me,’ so of course I did,” Shainwald says of Ginsburg, “and she said, ‘You and I had the same husbands. They were both supportive.’”</p>
<p>While working as a CPA, Sidney Shainwald represented artists including Jacques Lipchitz, George Grosz and Marc Chagall, and he and Sybil visited their studios.</p>
<p>“I started to buy what I could afford, which wasn’t too much,” Sybil Shainwald says. “I never thought of art as an investment. I bought what I liked.”</p>
<p>Her favorite piece of art is an oil painting of a woman on a wine bottle by Belgian surrealist Rene Magritte. She had tried to buy a similar piece by the artist at a Christie’s auction, but someone else outbid her.</p>
<p>“I was very unhappy,” she says. “Afterward, I went to Christie’s and said, ‘Do you think that when somebody goes over to Belgium, they could get another bottle?’ They called a couple of months later and they said, ‘We have a bottle for you.’ They had seven, all different. I went and picked out the one I liked.”</p>
<p>Renewed Relationship</p>
<p>Based on her time as a student at William &amp; Mary, the university might seem an unlikely destination for Shainwald’s art collection. When she entered as a 16-year-old freshman in the spring of 1945, she wasn’t sure whether she’d remain.</p>
<p>“I called my mother right away and said, ‘I absolutely hate this school. I have to come back to New York,’” she recalls in an oral history recorded in 2017 with Carmen Bolt of W&amp;M Libraries.</p>
<p>Shainwald (then Sybil Schwartz) was one of the few Jewish students at the time, and she was particularly uncomfortable with the racial segregation in the South. While at W&amp;M, she worked on The Flat Hat and took part in a protest when the Board of Visitors demanded the editor-in-chief of the student newspaper, Marilyn Kaemmerle, be fired and school officials temporarily shut down publication of the student newspaper after it published a 1945 editorial calling for African Americans to be recognized as equals and saying that one day black students should attend and fully participate in college life. Six years later, the first black student at W&amp;M enrolled in a graduate program in 1951.</p>
<p>Despite her qualms about the school’s social environment back then, Shainwald speaks highly of her professors. An American history major, she was a President Bryan Scholar and graduated Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
<p>“I did receive a great education,” she says.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, Shainwald reconnected with her alma mater. Gerald Bullock M. Ed. ’97, now the executive director of development for arts and sciences, met with her in 2010 when he was working as an advancement officer in the Northeast region. Two years later, she returned to campus for the first time since graduating in 1948 to attend Charter Day events in 2012. During that visit, Bullock introduced her to Douglas and law professor emerita Jayne Barnard.</p>
<p>She has since returned multiple times to speak at the school, and she established the Shainwald Immigration Law Clinic Fund.</p>
<p>“She became very devoted to our law students,” says Douglas, who is stepping down as dean at the end of June to return to the faculty. “When the students heard her biography, they were amazed. They would just huddle around her. It was clear that the students were mesmerized by her.”</p>
<p>Barnard says that Shainwald often shared meals with students working on the W&amp;M Journal of Race, Gender and Social Justice, and has maintained relationships with many of them as they’ve moved on into their careers.</p>
<p>“Even though she did not attend William &amp; Mary Law School, she’s made it and the Journal part of her life,” Barnard says. “We’ve been so lucky she ‘adopted’ us.”</p>
<p>In addition to receiving her honorary degree during William &amp; Mary’s 2019 Commencement, Shainwald was inducted in 2012 into W&amp;M’s Eta Circle of Omicron Delta Kappa, a leadership honor society for which she was ineligible in the 1940s because membership was reserved for men. Her latest visit to campus was in February for Charter Day Weekend and induction into the James Blair Society, which recognizes donors who have made cumulative gifts of $1 million or more to the university.</p>
<p>Now, Shainwald has another connection to strengthen her bond with William &amp; Mary: Her granddaughter, Emma Shainwald ’20, graduated in May with a degree in Asian Pacific Islander American Studies, with honors. Like her grandmother, Emma has worked to promote inclusivity at William &amp; Mary. During a May 1 online ceremony, she received the Center for Student Diversity’s Ernestine Jackson Award for Cross Cultural Understanding. The award recognizes her efforts to build positive relationships between all members of the W&amp;M community.</p>
<p>When asked what advice she would offer young women, Sybil Shainwald responds: “Go to law school.”</p>
<p>“What I’m interested in is making people’s lives better,” she says. “I like history a lot, but I thought I could make a difference by being a lawyer.”</p>
<p>Through the Shainwald Collection at the Muscarelle, she’ll have yet another way to make a difference for generations to come.</p>
<p>“The art can be used to support study programs in a variety of departments, stretching beyond art and art history to talk about gender, psychology and other academic fields of inquiry,” Brashear says. “That’s how a university museum can have an even greater impact, because it sits so perfectly in the intersection between the art world and the academic world.”

These stickers make face masks happier</p>
<p>The coronavirus crisis continues but daily life is slowly returning to normal. High school seniors return to school this Wednesday, and more people are returning to offices.But the recent cluster in Itaewon-dong, central Seoul, reminded everyone that Covid-19 can flare up at any time. One way to keep up your guard is by wearing a mask — a habit that will be with us for a long time.The JoongAng Ilbo asked nine Korean designers to partake in its Happy Mask campaign to encourage the wearing of masks in public.They came up with eight sticker designs conveying the campaign’s motto: “Always wear masks, in a fun way.”The stickers, each a work of art, can be stuck onto masks to add a pop of color and a cheery message.Lie Sang Bong, a veteran Korean fashion designer who participated in the project, said, “While masks can be stuffy and block communication, a small sticker stuck on the mask can be a messenger connecting hearts and sending encouragement to cheer each other up.”The sticker sheets are being distributed for free to subscribers of the JoongAng Ilbo and the Korea JoongAng Daily with Tuesday&rsquo;s paper. They will also be distributed by the Korea Medical Association to medical workers nationwide on the front line of the Covid-19 quarantine effort. They will also be sent to small businesses that have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic with messages of encouragement.: Designer Ko Tae-yong’s sticker features the mascot of his fashion brand Beyond Closet, a dog. Ko, who gained popularity for his “I.L.P. (I Love Pet)” T-shirts in 2010 featuring pet dogs, said, “I hope people can laugh out loud when they see a dog wearing a mask and washing his paws.”: Top celebrities like Beyoncé have been seen wearing designer Park Youn-hee’s brand Greedilous. Her sticker features a colorful military uniform motif. She said, “Like BTS’s ARMY [the boy band’s official fan club], it holds the meaning that we should all protect each other in difficult times because of the coronavirus.”: K-pop megastar BTS was featured wearing Han Hyun-min’s menswear brand MÜNN’s in its world tour concert film. “Wearing masks is a promise to people across the world,” he said. “We need to keep our promise in order to overcome Covid-19.”: Lee Chung Chung of womens wear line LIE is perhaps better known overseas than domestically and says he became more aware of the value of faith following the coronavirus outbreak. “We were impacted as air travel was cut off, but we are overcoming this because the staff held onto their beliefs and hung on,” he said. “If you believe, you will overcome any difficulty.”: Famed fashion designer Lie Sang Bong, known for his hangul designs, started his own campaign to overcome the coronavirus in January. His sticker design uses his “It’s OK” calligraphy, both in English and Korean lettering, which he also used on T-shirts.: Designer Shin Hye-young of Wnderkammer, a brand worn by K-pop stars Suzy, Hyuna, and Jennie of Blackpink, stresses minimalism. The word “happy” inside a heart with a smiley face is meant to cheer people up.: Designer duo Seo Byung-mun and Um Ji-na of BMUET(TE) portray smiling lips hidden by masks with pink flowers. Seo and Um said that the design “sends a positive energy through a smiling image despite wearing masks.”: Designer Chung Jae-sun of J. Chung and Taze was inspired by the Monstera deliciosa plant, featured frequently in the paintings of French artist Henri Matisse. “The emergence of the new coronavirus is a result of humans not understanding the environment,” she said. “Seeing the Monstera, which endures in harsh environments, I hope we can consider the environment one more time.”BY LEE JEONG-BONG, YOO BOO-HYEOK, SEO JI-MYEONG AND KIM NA-HYUN [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]

<h3 id="5-matisse-paintings-that-revolutionized-modern-art">&ldquo;5 Matisse Paintings That Revolutionized Modern Art&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://mymodernmet.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/matisse-paintings-thumbnail.jpg" alt="img">
Undeterred by critics, Matisse honed his instincts and went against trends to develop an expressive style that would have massive ramifications. As both a friend to and rival of Picasso, who was 11 years younger, Matisse pushed boundaries and inspired other artists to follow his lead.</p>
<p>With a career that spanned 50 years, today the French artist is considered one of the foremost creators of the 20th century. From his early use of bold color to create light and shadow to his later work with cut paper, Matisse was continuously pushing the boundaries of his creativity. To celebrate his artistry and his contribution to the history of art, let’s take a look at 5 of Matisse’s most celebrated paintings.</p>
<p>These famous paintings by Henri Matisse helped revolutionize the art world.</p>
<p>Woman with a Hat (1905)</p>
<p>When this portrait of Matisse’s wife Amélie was shown alongside more classical sculptures at the Salon d’Automne, an independent art exhibition in Paris, it helped give birth to the Fauvist movement. At the time, the work was panned by critics, who found its loose brushstrokes, unnatural colors, and unfinished quality shocking. For Matisse, Woman with a Hat marked a journey toward a new, expressive style. Certainly, the painting helped lay the groundwork for a new type of portraiture, one that didn’t respect strictly realistic depictions.</p>
<p>Though Matisse was initially demoralized at the reception this painting received, his spirits were lifted when it was purchased by the Stein family, which include famed collectors Gertrude and her brother Leo. Gertrude, in particular, was a champion of the avant-garde and was immortalized in her own portrait by Picasso.</p>
<p>The Green Stripe (1905)</p>
<p>The second portrait of Matisse’s wife proved just as controversial as the first. Here, Matisse takes his bold use of color to the extreme by painting a green line down the center of her face. What may seem extreme was actually Matisse’s attempt to produce light, shadow, and volume without using traditional techniques. Once again, critics derided the image, with one stating that it forced viewers to see the painter’s wife in “a strange and terrible aspect.” Still, when looking at later Cubist portraits by Picasso, Matisse’s influence is undeniable.</p>
<p>Le bonheur de vivre (1905/1906)</p>
<p>With his monumental oil painting Le bonheur de vivre (The Joy of Life), Matisse doubled-down on what he’d started at the 1905 Salon d’Automne. The large canvas was Matisse’s way of confirming that he adhered to everything the Fauvists stood for, even if critics at the time didn’t appreciate their innovative take on art. The vivid colors and Matisse’s refusal to use spatial norms was a revolution. Ignoring how Western art typically plays with scale and proportion, Matisse turned tradition on its head. And, in doing so, he created what some consider one of the cornerstones of modern art.</p>
<p>Purchased by Gertrude Stein, it was hung in the Paris apartment where she had her weekly salons. This is where a young Picasso saw the painting and was so determined to outdo Matisse that he began work on Les Demoiselles d’Avignon—another pillar of 20th-century art.</p>
<p>The Dance (Second Version) (1909/1910)</p>
<p>Using a motif we can already see in the background of Le bonheur de vivre, The Dance was created for Russian businessman and art collector Sergei Shchukin. In it, a group of dancers twirls in a circle. Their movement and tension is palpable. Matisse’s ability to paint such an expressive work by using limited colors and focusing on lines, rather than shadow and highlights, is an incredible achievement.</p>
<p>This is the finalized version of a well-known painting located in New York’s MoMA. This first version, which Matisse viewed as a preparatory sketch, has a much lighter mood and energy. For the final version of The Dance, Matisse darkened the color palette and gave the figures a power that is lacking in the sketch. Thanks to his masterful use of line and color, for many The Dance is seen as the highlight of Matisse’s career and a turning point in modern art.</p>
<p>Blue Nudes (1952)</p>
<p>After being diagnosed with stomach cancer in 1941, Matisse was left confined to a chair. But he never let this obstacle stand in the way of his creativity. He began creating cut paper collages with the help of assistants, who would paint large sheets of paper in gouache for the artist. Matisse would then cut the paper into different shapes and create compositions. Often, as is the case with his Blue Nudes series, they were then transformed into lithographs.</p>
<p>Blue Nudes is a triumphant series of four nudes. Each was carefully planned by Matisse, who created studies in his notebooks and spent several weeks getting the cut paper arrangements to his liking. Much as he relied on limited colors in his paintings, these cut paper works also favor single flat tones. Inspired by his visit to Tahiti twenty years earlier, Matisse created volume using overlapping shapes, once again demonstrating his eye for the avant-garde. Just two years after finishing this innovative series, Matisse lost his life.</p>
