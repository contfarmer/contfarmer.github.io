<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/C387/production/_113655005_gettyimages-1259082838.jpg" alt="img">
Anthony Martial was brought down for the penalty from which Bruno Fernandes gave Manchester United the lead</p>
<p>Manchester United secured a place in the Champions League at the expense of Leicester City with victory at King Power Stadium.</p>
<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&rsquo;s side needed a point from this decisive final-day meeting to confirm a place in the top four - and break the hearts of the Foxes, who were in a Champions League spot for so much of the season.</p>
<p>Leicester needed victory once Chelsea took command at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers but their dreams were dashed as Bruno Fernandes scored a 71st-minute penalty after Anthony Martial tumbled under challenge from Wes Morgan and Jonny Evans.</p>
<p>Both sides had their chances, with Leicester City keeper Kasper Schmeichel saving well from Marcus Rashford in the first half and Jamie Vardy seeing a header glance off the frame of the goal after the break.</p>
<p>Leicester pressed but could not break Manchester United down and their misery was compounded when Evans was sent off against his former club for a wild, late lunge on Scott McTominay.</p>
<p>Manchester United confirmed the formalities seconds from time when substitute Jesse Lingard robbed Schmeichel and rolled the ball into an empty net.</p>
<p>It is a result that fulfils the usual minimum requirement of Champions League qualification for Manchester United.</p>
<p>But while Leicester City&rsquo;s fifth-placed finish is highly creditable and earns a place in the Europa League, this will undoubtedly be a huge disappointment and anti-climax after being in a position to reach the Champions League for so long.</p>
<p>It will be scant consolation for them that striker Vardy will claim the Golden Boot, as the Premier League&rsquo;s top scorer with 23 goals.</p>
<p>Fernandes transforms Man Utd</p>
<p>Media playback is not supported on this device Leicester 0-2 Man Utd: Solskjaer &lsquo;delighted&rsquo; after Man Utd qualify for Champions League</p>
<p>After Fernandes had made an impressive debut in a goalless draw at home to Wolves on 1 February, Manchester United stood 14 points adrift of Leicester City, who were third.</p>
<p>Fast forward to his decisive role in this victory that sees United qualify for next season&rsquo;s Champions League by taking that third place, and you can see the extent of his impact.</p>
<p>The Portuguese attacker - a mid-season signing from Sporting Lisbon in a deal that could eventually be worth around Â£68m - has provided the missing link for this Manchester United side.</p>
<p>He has built a bridge between midfield and a talented attacking array of strikers with his talent and his positive style, looking forward every time he receives possession.</p>
<p>Fernandes was not at his best here but he was the man who unlocked Leicester&rsquo;s defence as Martial won the crucial penalty, then performed his usual hop, skip and jump to send Schmeichel the wrong way and ease any lingering United nerves.</p>
<p>It capped a remarkable recovery for Manchester United - with credit also due to manager Solskjaer for guiding his side into the top four.</p>
<p>Leicester suffer bitter disappointment</p>
<p>Media playback is not supported on this device Leicester 2-0 Man Utd: We wouldnât be challenging without Vardyâs goals - Brendan Rodgers</p>
<p>The scenes at the final whistle here showed the extent of Leicester City&rsquo;s bitter disappointment at being denied the footballing and financial prize that seemed theirs for the taking for so long.</p>
<p>Brendan Rodgers&rsquo; side had started to lose their early-season sparkle even before the campaign was halted in March by the coronavirus pandemic - yet they were still in a powerful position as the finish line approached.</p>
<p>They have still had a fine season but there is no point glossing over this huge missed opportunity.</p>
<p>Rodgers is left to rue moments such as the inexplicable meltdown at Bournemouth, where they led at half-time only to lose 4-1.</p>
<p>The manager faces a big job to pick his players up and remind them of what they have achieved in returning to European football.</p>
<p>When they go into next season&rsquo;s Europa League, will they be without players such as Ben Chilwell, a target for Chelsea and reduced here to exhorting his team-mates from the directors&rsquo; box as he was absent through injury?</p>
<p>Man of the match - Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United)</p>
<p>January signing Bruno Fernandes has transformed Manchester United this season and held his nerve when it mattered against Leicester</p>
<p>Foxes fail to hang on to top four - the stats</p>
<p>Leicester finished fifth despite ending 325 days inside the top four places during the season.</p>
<p>Manchester United recorded a top-four finish in the Premier League for just the second time in five seasons - and the third time in seven seasons since Sir Alex Ferguson retired.</p>
<p>Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers has lost 10 of his 12 meetings with Manchester United across all competitions, suffering defeats in each of the past five.</p>
<p>Manchester United extended their unbeaten run to 14 games in the Premier League, their longest run without defeat in the competition since April 2017.</p>
<p>Bruno Fernandes&rsquo; penalty was the 14th Manchester United have been awarded in the Premier League this season, which is the most for a team in a single campaign in the competition&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>Since making his debut in the competition in February, Fernandes has been directly involved in more goals in the competition than any other player (15).</p>
<p>Jesse Lingard scored his first Premier League goal for Manchester United since December 2018, when he hit two in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&rsquo;s first game in charge against Cardiff.</p>
<p>Harry Maguire became the first outfield player since Gary Pallister in 1994-95 to start every game in a Premier League campaign for Manchester United.

Arguably the pick of final Premier League games of the season on Sunday is this winner-takes-all clash at the King Power Stadium. Which team will secure Champions League football? Read our guide below to find out how to get a reliable live stream of Leicester City vs Manchester United. The home side had looked almost guaranteed a top-four finish when the league returned to action from lockdown in June, but a disastrous run of results since the restart are now outsiders to hit that target. Leicester find themselves in fifth behind United in third and Chelsea in fourth. With just one point separating the three, a defeat for the Foxes would end their dream of a return to European football&rsquo;s biggest tournament, an eventuality that would be devastating for Brendan Rodgers&rsquo; men having played so well for three quarters of the campaign.</p>
<p>Source: Premier League</p>
<p>The scenario could have been worse for the Foxes, were it not for Man United&rsquo;s slip up against West Ham in midweek, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&rsquo;s Red Devils fortunate to secure a point against an impressive Hammers side. United had been on a superb run of results post lockdown, but following their defeat to Chelsea in the Cup last weekend, coupled with the stalemate with West Ham, Reds fans will be fearing that United have run out of steam on the final straight. It looks set to be a cracking game - read on to find out how to watch the match no matter where you are in the world. Leicester City vs Manchester United: Where and when?

Jesse Lingard&rsquo;s goal was his first in the league since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&rsquo;s first game in charge, against Cardiff City, but he did find the net with a cracker in the Europa League game at Astana last year and at Tranmere Rovers in the Emirates FA Cup. The substitute netted the final goal of the entire Premier League campaign when capitalising on a mistake by Kasper Schmeichel.</p>
<p>By completing the 90 minutes on his return to the King Power Stadium, Harry Maguire made it a full house in the Premier League for the season â having played every minute of the competition. Our ever-present captain also became this first outfield player for the Reds to start every match of a league season since Gary Pallister in 1994/95. Jonny Evans may not have finished the game but he was in every one of the Foxes&rsquo; XIs in the league too.

<p><img src="https://akcdn.detik.net.id/api/wm/2020/07/26/1259040402_169.jpeg?wid=54&amp;w=650&amp;v=1&amp;t=jpeg" alt="img">
Babak pertama Leicester City vs Manchester United berjalan minim peluang berbahaya. Hal tersebut membuat skor tetap 0-0 hingga jeda.</p>
<p>Leicester menjamu MU di King Power Stadium pada pekan pamungkas Liga Inggris, Minggu (26/7/2020) malam WIB. Duel ini menentukan siapa yang berhak meraih tiket ke Liga Champions.</p>
<p>Tim tamu memainkan trio Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood dan Anthony Martial sebagai starter. Ketiganya disokong oleh Bruno Fernandes. Sementara, The Foxes bertumpu pada Jamie Vardy dan Kalechi Iheanacho untuk menggempur lini belakang Setan Merah.</p>
<p>Di awal laga, MU mengambil inisiatif untuk melancarkan serangan. Ancaman pertama dihadirkan mereka pada menit ke-10.</p>
<p>Umpan Rashford dari sisi kiri, menemui Greenwood yang menyusup ke kotak penalti di antara bek Leicester. Namun, sundulan pemain 18 tahun ini masih melambung dari gawang Kasper Schmeichel.</p>
<p>Tak ingin MU leluasa menguasai bola, Leicester mulai memperagakan high-pressing. Di menit ke-15, Nemanja Matic melakukan kesalahan saat mendapat tekanan dari pemain tuan rumah.</p>
<p>Umpannya justru mengarah ke Iheanacho. Ia lalu memberikan umpan ke Youri Tielemens yang langsung menyodorkan bola ke Wilfred Ndidi.</p>
<p>Ndidi melepas tembakan keras dari luar kotak penalti. Upayanya ini belum mengancam David De Gea karena melambung di atas gawang.</p>
<p>Hingga memasuki pertengahan babak pertama, kedua tim masih sama-sama kesulitan menghadirkan peluang berbahaya.</p>
<p>MU sempat menggetarkan jala Leicester di menit ke-32 lewat Fernandes. Namun, torehan ini tak dianggap gol karena Fernandes lebih dulu offside saat menerima umpan dari Paul Pogba.</p>
<p>Menjelang babak pertama usai, MU hampir saja membuka keunggulan. Bermula dari situasi sepak pojok, Rashford terbebas dari pengawalan di tiang jauh.</p>
<p>Ia melepas sepakan keras, tapi Schemeichel masih sigap menepis bola. Skor 0-0 tak berubah hingga jeda turun minum.</p>
<p>Susunan Pemain</p>
<p>Leicester City: Kasper Schmeichel; James Justin, Wes Morgan, Jonny Evans; Marc Albrighton, Hamza Choudhury, Wilfred Ndidi, Youri Tielemans, Luke Thomas; Kelechi Iheanacho, Jamie Vardy.</p>
<p>Manchester United: David de Gea; Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Victor Lindelof, Harry Maguire, Brandon Williams; Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic; Mason Greenwood, Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford; Anthony Martial.</p>
<p>Manchester United Menang 2-0 dari Leicester City
