<p>This is what you call a big-cat nap as 10 lions lie spark out after being tranquillised so they can be relocated.</p>
<p>The animals were part of a project to increase wildlife in the Zambezi Delta in Mozambique, which had been without predators for 30 years due to poachers.</p>
<p>Coordinator Ivan Carter, 50, helped relocate 24 lions from South Africa by road and air in 2018 and the numbers have already topped 60.</p>
<p>Sharing the photos, Ivan said: “It was quite exciting.</p>
<p>“And it was an unbelievably momentous moment watching the majestic lion repopulating the area.”</p>
<p>It has been described as &lsquo;history&rsquo;s biggest habitat recovery project&rsquo; as it started with 24 lions and now has over 60.</p>
<p>After careful consideration, Ivan and the team, selected the healthiest lions to transport via car and plane to their forever home which has two million acres of land in May 2018.</p>
<p>(Image: @sean_viljoen / @cabelafamilyfoundation / Caters news)</p>
<p>The project was a massive success as they have now tripled in numbers and there&rsquo;s over 60 lions.</p>
<p>Ivan from White River, South Africa, said: &ldquo;It was quite exciting moving the lions from around five different locations in South Africa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had to pick those with good genetics and health who have been roaming free all of their lives - this was done by taking them to the vets for tests prior to putting them into quarantine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were in a large enclosure for six weeks and put into groups so they could integrate, otherwise, they would have just walked straight off and the habitat recovery project would have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>(Image: @sean_viljoen / @cabelafamilyfoundation / Caters news)</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had to get various permits and vet certificates and had to ensure the Zabeza Delta conservation had enough prey base there for the lions to survive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole project took ten weeks, from the moment the first dart was shot to the second the first lion stepped foot back into the wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ivan praises Cabela Family Foundation for funding the relocation, seven years of follow up science and research and protection for the lions.</p>
<p>(Image: @sean_viljoen / @cabelafamilyfoundation / Caters news)</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;Without the foundation, we would have never been able to make this happen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They also paid for satellite collars for the original lions - we have biologists on the ground who are always studying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An anti poaching team is also funded to keep the lions and wildlife of the area safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This project has been a complete rejuvenation of wild lions and they have done really well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The relocation was caught on camera by photographer Sean Viljoen who has shared the images.

<h3 id="six-tips-to-help-you-sleep-through-the-night">&ldquo;Six tips to help you sleep through the night&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straight.com/files/v3/styles/gs_feature/public/images/20/06/sleep_image.jpg?itok=oks2PFhg" alt="img">
1 of 1 2 of 1</p>
<p>(This story is written in partnership with .)</p>
<p>Many of us don’t need to be reminded why sleep is vital for our health—we pick an evening in bed over a night out any day. But for those who don’t take their snooze cycle seriously, it’s important to note that sleep deprivation can impact your mood, immune system, memory, weight, and hormones. iMD Health wants to help people get the best sleep possible, which can be achieved by following these six tips:</p>
<p>Say “no” to daytime naps</p>
<p>This tip is often reluctantly received but limiting your daily naps will help you sleep better at night. Replace your two-hour afternoon slumber with a 30-minute catnap. After a long nap, it’s common to wake up feeling (and looking) like you’ve stepped right off the set of The Walking Dead. Whereas you’ll likely feel refreshed after a shorter nap, which means that no afternoon coffee is needed. If you desperately need to nap, try to lie down earlier in the day so that the snooze doesn’t interfere with your nighttime sleep.</p>
<p>Stick to a sleep schedule</p>
<p>Get your body on a proper sleep cycle by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day. iMD Health recommends that adults get at least seven hours of sleep per day, not exceeding more than eight hours. Oversleeping can make you feel drowsy throughout the day. If you’re having difficulties falling asleep at your usual time, try reading a book until you feel heavy-eyed. Avoid turning on the television or scrolling through your phone since electronics can interfere with your internal clock and melatonin production.</p>
<p>Be mindful of what you eat and drink</p>
<p>Falling asleep with a belly full of salted caramel cheesecake is not an easy feat—we’ve all been there. Try to avoid eating large meals within a couple hours of your bedtime. Your evening glass of red wine, late afternoon coffee, or pre-bedtime vape may also decrease the amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep you are getting at night. According to iMD Health, the stimulating effects of nicotine and caffeine take hours to wear off and can wreak havoc on quality sleep. Alcohol has the tendency to make you sleepy after a glass or two but it will keep you awake throughout the night.</p>
<p>Create a comfortable sleeping space</p>
<p>If you’re blessed enough to live in an apartment that is larger than 500-square feet, try to use your bedroom only for sleeping. This means no television marathons or eating while in bed. The ideal sleeping environment is dark and quiet, which means you may need to invest in some earplugs or blackout curtains.</p>
<p>Prioritize daily exercise</p>
<p>As stated on iMD Health, regular physical activity can promote better sleep. Try to set aside some time for stretching or a bubble bath after exercising so that your body and mind can unwind before bedtime.</p>
<p>Manage your stress and anxiety before bedtime</p>
<p>There is nothing worse than staring at the ceiling at 11:45 p.m. while you worry about what middle names you’ll give your children in five years. If your thoughts run wild at night, try meditating or journaling right before you hop into bed. It can also be helpful to focus on your breathing when you’re trying to fall asleep as this can fend off any insignificant worries that pop into your head.</p>

Celebrating the flag of the United States, mastering the art of cat napping, and a visit from some doves.</p>
<p>DES MOINES, Iowa — Text HAPPY to 515-457-1026 to watch more HAPPY MOMENTS!</p>
<p>The week started with Flag Day, and a viewer snapped this beautiful image out of West Des Moines.</p>
<p>The caption read &ldquo;The flags were flying at McLaren&rsquo;s Resthaven Cemetery. What a beautiful sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In case you didn&rsquo;t know, Flag Day commemorates the adoption of the United States flag on June 14 1777, and the celebration lasts the entire week.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a cat nap in action. Or inaction, really.</p>
<p>This is Grayson the cat and his person caught him sprawled out in the sunlight enjoying a relaxing afternoon. Maybe your happy moment is your pet. Maybe your happy moment is a nap.</p>
<p>Either way, Grayson here has you covered.</p>
<p>And Betty is sharing her deck with some new visitors.</p>
<p>Two mourning doves have taken to perching right by her house every day, and she says they don&rsquo;t seem to be afraid of her at all.</p>
<p>Maybe the birds know that we could all use more Happy Moments!</p>

<h3 id="front-porch-tabby-cat-in-doghouse-after-hot-sleepless-night-in-may">&ldquo;Front Porch: Tabby cat in doghouse after hot, sleepless night in May&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.spokesman.com/photos/2020/06/15/5ee85d67455f6.image_zgUC2UR_t1200.jpg?298603a24e8d51915fce203907ff2746e482a5a6" alt="img">
It’s a good thing he’s so cute.</p>
<p>It’s also a good thing I have the Facebook Memories app to remind me of how utterly sweet and tiny Sir Walter Scott was when we first met him last year in June.</p>
<p>I needed those reminders, because recently Walter (no longer tiny) was the cause of a very long sleepless night.</p>
<p>To be fair, it wasn’t entirely his fault. On May 29, the temperature soared, reaching 90 degrees for the first time this year. Derek and I weren’t prepared for the sudden warmth. We don’t have central air and since we were both out all day, we didn’t turn on our dining room air conditioner until we got home. Our bedroom window unit was still out in the shed. Even with fans running, our house was hot and stuffy.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have to sleep with the bedroom door open,” I said.</p>
<p>My husband eyed Thor and Walter.</p>
<p>“Great,” he said. “You know we’ll have company.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t too worried. After our older cat Milo died, we let Thor sleep with us whenever he wanted. He’s a placid fellow, and just drapes himself at our feet and snores. Derek can outsnore both man and beast, so Thor’s nasally rumblings didn’t bother me.</p>
<p>Walter is a different cat – he’s all about the action. Apparently, he didn’t get the memo that kittens sleep 16 to 20 hours a day, because from the time we brought him home at 8 weeks, it was clear he could catnap, but long stretches of sleep were not in his wheelhouse.</p>
<p>It also became clear that Walter is a fervent Mama’s boy. My son paraphrased a Bible verse to describe his devotion thusly: “Where Mama is, there Walter will be also.”</p>
<p>And he’s a cuddly cat. While he’s not allowed to spend the night in our room, he does curl up in bed with me every morning after breakfast. We both catch a brief bit of shuteye before embracing the day in earnest.</p>
<p>He also knows the nighttime drill. Each evening I get into bed to read before Derek joins me. Well, joins us, because as I mentioned, Walter is rather attached to me. He likes Derek, too, but not at bedtime. Derek’s arrival means Walter’s exit.</p>
<p>Our furry feline tries to circumvent his ouster by feigning death or hiding under the bed.</p>
<p>“Walter, it’s night-night time,” Derek would say to the prone cat.</p>
<p>No response.</p>
<p>Walter squeezes his eyes shut and won’t budge when Derek pokes him. If he doesn’t make a sudden dash under the bed, my husband picks up the tabby’s inert body, carries him from the room and deposits him on the sofa. Then it’s a sprint to see which of them will make it back to the bedroom first. Personally, I think the exercise is good for both of them.</p>
<p>On the hot night in question, after cranking up the fans, we let sleeping cats lie. Thor slumbered on when we turned off the light. Walter trilled questioningly.</p>
<p>“Go back to sleep,” I said.</p>
<p>So, he sunk his head into my pillow and snuggled up next to me. A few minutes later, he patted my face.</p>
<p>I ignored him.</p>
<p>He licked my eyelids.</p>
<p>I ignored him.</p>
<p>He laid his whiskery chin on my nose.</p>
<p>I couldn’t breathe, so I nudged him off.</p>
<p>A slight thud and the tinkling of his bell, notified me he’d left the room.</p>
<p>I’d just nodded off, when I felt a soft body land at my side. Then a wet, slobbery piece of felt hit my cheek. Having taken his required catnap, Walter decided it was playtime and brought his beloved gray mouse to bed. The mouse is attached to a string, and usually I wave it around while he chases it and pounces on it.</p>
<p>“One a.m. is not playtime Walter,” I whispered, tossing the toy toward the door as hard as I could.</p>
<p>Big mistake.</p>
<p>Walter loves a good game of fetch. He had the mouse back in bed before I could close my eyes. I refused to throw it again, so Walter found someone else to annoy. He discovered Thor, sound asleep on Derek’s feet and launched himself toward the unsuspecting senior tabby.</p>
<p>Hissing, growling and mayhem ensued as Thor fled from his tormentor.</p>
<p>“One cat down, one to go,” Derek mumbled.</p>
<p>His mumble alerted Walter to his next victim. He sprang from Derek’s feet, landing with a thunk on Derek’s stomach.</p>
<p>“Oof! Get him off of me!” Derek roared.</p>
<p>And so went the rest of the long night. Sometime around 5 a.m. I noticed the house had cooled considerably, but my head was sweating due to Walter’s proximity to my pillow.</p>
<p>I scooped him up, put him in the hallway and shut the door.</p>
<p>Piteous, heartbreaking, tiny meows poured from the hallway.</p>
<p>I put my cat-warmed pillow over my head.</p>
<p>“You’re in the doghouse, Walter,” I said.</p>
<p>A few hours later I opened the door, and Walter came running. Weaving in and around my ankles, stretching up his paws, eager to be in my embrace.</p>
<p>Like I said, it’s a good thing he’s so cute. It’s also a good thing Derek has our window air conditioner ready to go. Who knows? We may see 90 degrees again someday, and this time we’ll be ready. No more cats on hot, sleeping Hvals.
