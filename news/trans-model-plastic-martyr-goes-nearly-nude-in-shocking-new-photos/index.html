<p>Trans Model Plastic Martyr Goes Nearly Nude In Shocking New Photos The controversial singer says she’s also headed back to ‘Little Women LA.’</p>
<p>She’s back!</p>
<p>Transgender model and overall troublemaker Plastic Martyr says she’s making a cameo in the current season of Little Women LA, RadarOnline.com can confirm — and to promote her big return, she’s stripping down for a nearly naked photo shoot!</p>
<p>Martyr, 29, first appeared in season 5 of the reality show, when it was revealed Briana Renee’s now estranged-husband Matt Grundhoffer had sent the dark-haired beauty naked photos and “sick” messages over Instagram.</p>
<p>Her initial appearance especially startled Terra Jole, who upset Martyr by calling her “this person,” instead of her preferred pronoun of “her.”</p>
<p>After a brief fight, Tonya Banks kicked her out of the room, something Martyr still hasn’t forgotten about, and addresses on her return.</p>
<p>“I don’t have any more crazy drama, though I do talk a lot of s**t about Tonya and Terra which I’m absolutely unapologetic about,” Martyr told Prune magazine. “I think the real reason she wasn’t (fired) for her transphobic comments towards me was that Terra is an executive producer of the show, and Tonya is her mouth piece and puppet. Terra LOVES having people in her corner backing up her every move, so she needs Tonya around for that.”</p>
<p>Aside from her big return, Martyr continues to work on her music. Check out this Radar gallery for more revealing images of Martyr, and what she plans to do next.

<h3 id="xxx-2-controversy-ekta-kapoor-reveals-shes-getting-rape-threats">&ldquo;&lsquo;XXX 2&rsquo; controversy: Ekta Kapoor reveals she&rsquo;s getting rape threats&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l158_12521591521294.jpg" alt="img">
Ekta Kapoor has broken her silence on the ongoing controversy around XXX 2, a web series produced by her. The 45-year-old producer said the controversial scene has been deleted. She, however, revealed that she has been receiving rape threats over the matter. Meanwhile, a number of police complaints have been lodged against Ekta for allegedly insulting the Indian Army through her series. Here&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>Controversy Firstly, what is the controversy all about?</p>
<p>The episode in question is a part of the Ekta Kapoor-founded streaming platform ALTBalaji&rsquo;s erotic web series XXX Season 2. Titled Pyaar Aur Plastic, the episode features Ribbhu Mehra, Paree Pande, and Aaditi Kohli in lead roles. It showcases a woman indulging in an extramarital affair, while her husband, an Indian Army soldier, is out on duty at the border.</p>
<p>Complaints Earlier, former &lsquo;BB&rsquo; contestant Vikas Pathak filed FIR</p>
<p>Earlier this month, former Bigg Boss contestant Hindustani Bhau aka Vikas Pathak filed a complaint against Ekta and her mother, Shobha Kapoor, in Mumbai. He alleged that her show intends to insult the Indian Army, their uniform, the national emblem, and the colonel tag. Days later, some former army personnel and members of the Martyrs Welfare Foundation (MWF) also filed an FIR against Ekta.</p>
<p>Quote Here&rsquo;s what Pathak said about the complaint</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anti-national people like Shobha Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor are promoting sexual activities in public and corrupting the mind of youth and families. They have further stooped by targeting our Indian military, their uniform and defaming its national emblem,&rdquo; Pathak had said after filing the complaint.</p>
<p>Response The cyber bullying irritated me the most, said Ekta</p>
<p>Now, in an online chat with columnist/author Shobhaa De, Ekta stated that she did not mind furnishing an apology to the Army. &ldquo;It is no big deal for me. It is the smallest thing to do. Respecting the Army is a part of what I do,&rdquo; she said. She, however, added that she could not take the cyber bullying and the online abuse.</p>
<p>Statement &lsquo;Sex is bad but rape is okay?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sarcastically terming Pathak as &ldquo;the patriot of the year,&rdquo; Ekta went on to say that he &ldquo;decided to come out there, abuse my mother, abuse me&rdquo;. &ldquo;This is now no longer about the Army or sexual content because the irony of it is you are saying that you want to rape a girl&hellip; Means sex is bad but rape is okay?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Quote &lsquo;I have decided to stand up against cyber-bullying&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I have decided to take the route of actually standing up to the cyber-bullying,&rdquo; Ekta said. She added, &ldquo;If they can decide to take my nudes out, put out my nudes on the net, call me r****, then tomorrow, they can do this to any girl. You want to rub my nose on the ground? Well, you are not getting a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Briana&rsquo;s Nightmare! Stunning Trans Model To Tell All About Matt&rsquo;s Sexts On &lsquo;Little Women&rsquo;</p>
<p>Briana&rsquo;s Nightmare! Stunning Trans Model To Tell All About Matt&rsquo;s Sexts On &lsquo;Little Women&rsquo; Will the new mom finally leave her cheating husband?</p>
<p>Little Women: LA star Briana Renee and her husband, Matt Grundhoffer, may be back together after his cheating scandal, but the parents to newborn son Maverick could return to a state of marital crisis this summer.</p>
<p>RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that beautiful trans model Plastic Martyr will star on an upcoming episode of the Lifetime reality show to tell all about the disgraced Grundhoffer, who admitted to sexting other women online during his wife’s pregnancy last season.</p>
<p>Martyr and Little Women: LA cast member Christy McGinity Gibel hit up a nail salon in Los Angeles on June 30 to talk about Grundhoffer’s shocking attempt at seduction, an onlooker reveals.</p>
<p>“Plastic Martyr told Christy that Matt sent her naked photos and sick messages over Instagram,” the salon eyewitness tells Radar, adding that the model claimed she rejected his advances.</p>
<p>“She said she’s worried about Briana and doesn’t think Matt should be allowed around their children.”</p>
<p>Another source claims that Renee, 36, and Plastic Martyr were once good friends, making Grundhoffer’s moves the ultimate betrayal.</p>
<p>A rep for the series confirms that the model filmed a scene for the show.</p>
<p>In a move sure to upset Renee and Grundhoffer, a show insider reveals Martyr will return to set next week.</p>
<p>“All the girls know that Matt sent these shocking messages to her,” the insider claims.</p>
<p>The scene is expected to air on the fifth season of the Lifetime series, which premieres July 13.</p>
<p>As Radar exclusively reported, the 39-year-old father of two, and stepfather to Renee’s daughter Leiana, has a history of sordid behavior. He has been arrested for strangling an ex-girlfriend, driving under the influence, and engaging in malicious mischief.</p>
<p>Though her friends and family begged her to leave him, Renee ultimately decided to remain by her troubled husband’s side.

<p><img src="https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2016/07/07/briana-renee.jpg" alt="img">
Viewers who saw Season 4 of “Little Women: LA” know that Matt Ericson sent dirty messages to other women while Briana Renee was pregnant, but Radar Online uncovered the identity of one of the women. Meet Plastic Martyr: A transgender model with more than 25,000 Instagram followers and over 180,000 Twitter followers.</p>
<p>Plastic Martyr is slated to appear on Season 5 of “Little Women: LA.” She reportedly went to a nail salon with Briana’s friend, Christy McGinty, to talk about Matt’s disrespectful behavior. &ldquo;She told Christy that Matt sent her naked photos and sick messages over Instagram,” an insider told Radar Online Tuesday. Despite Matt’s persistence, Plastic Martyr said she shot down his advances.</p>
<p>The pint-sized reality star gave birth to a son, Maverick Jax, last week, but Plastic Marty doesn’t think he should be able to see him or Briana’s daughter from another relationship, Leiana. “She said she’s worried about Briana and doesn’t think Matt should be allowed around their children,” a source told Radar Online.</p>
<p>Okay boys it&rsquo;s that simple pic.twitter.com/PHlVRV2Zu8 — Plastic Martyr (@plasticmartyr) July 7, 2016</p>
<p>While some fans might be shocked to learn Matt was sending messages to Plastic Martyr, Briana’s costars – Terra Jolé, Tonya Banks, Jasmine Arteaga Sorge and Elena Gant—already knew.</p>
<p>Here’s a little more about Plastic Martyr: Aside from the “Little Women: LA” drama, she’s a celebrity in her own right. She has been modeling since the age of 14 and recently posed for Auxiliary Magazine. She also hosts a radio show called “Just Like You.”</p>
<p>She wants to keep her birth name hidden. &ldquo;I came up with it when I was 14 and had a big following on MySpace. I didn’t want to use my real name for safety reasons so I made up a fun little stage name and it stuck,&rdquo; she told Ken Devo in 2014.</p>
<p>Even though she&rsquo;s popular on social media sites like Twitter and Instagram, she first gained fame on MySpace. &ldquo;I posted the photos on MySpace and next thing I know I was being contacted by all these different photographers to shoot,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Season 5 of “Little Women: LA” will premiere on Lifetime Wednesday, July 13 at 9 p.m. EDT.</p>
