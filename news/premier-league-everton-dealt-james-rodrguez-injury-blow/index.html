<p>Premier League pace-setters Everton have been dealt a blow after manager Carlo Ancelotti confirmed that James Rodríguez is set to miss Sunday’s top-flight clash with Southampton through injury.</p>
<p>Derby injury rules James out of Everton&rsquo;s Saints clash</p>
<p>Summer signing James picked up the issue early in Everton’s 2-2 draw with city rivals Liverpool last weekend - a stalemate that ended the Toffees&rsquo; 100% start to the Premier League season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, James had a problem during the game,&rdquo; Ancelotti said on Thursday. “He had a mistimed tackle with Virgil van Dijk at the beginning of the game and I think he will not be available for the game against Southampton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James Everton</p>
<p>Midfielder</p>
<p>Colombia</p>
<p>Everton will also be without captain Seamus Coleman at St Mary’s, Ancelotti telling reporters that the right-back faces &ldquo;two or three weeks&rdquo; out.</p>
<p>Impressive James to fore for Premier League leaders</p>
<p>James, 29, has shone for Everton since joining from Real Madrid in the close season, scoring three goals and supplying three assists in his first five Premier League appearances to help his new side to the top of the table.</p>
<p>Van Dijk faces long-term absence with ligament injury</p>
<p>Van Dijk himself suffered an injury in Saturday’s derby at Goodison Park, with Liverpool revealing the following day that the Dutchman damaged knee ligaments in a challenge with Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.</p>
<p>Although the Reds have not offered a timeline for Van Dijk&rsquo;s return, he is expected to miss most, if not all, of the rest of the season.

October 17 was one of the darkest days in Virgil van Dijk&rsquo;s football career.</p>
<p>The Dutchman was on the other end of a heavy challenge from Jordan Pickford after just nine minutes played in the Merseyside Derby.</p>
<p>Van Dijk was forced off through injury and it was later revealed that he had torn his ACL.</p>
<p>There was an outpouring of emotion from Liverpool fans after news circulated that he is likely to miss the end of the season.</p>
<p>But some football fans decided they were going to make a joke of the whole situation, with #RIPVirgil trending on twitter on Monday.</p>
<p>But Everton have also had some injury news from the game.</p>
<p>Carlo Ancelotti revealed on Thursday afternoon that James Rodriguez had suffered an injury and is now going to miss their game against Southampton on the weekend.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, he was injured after a clash with Van Dijk after just 30 seconds played.</p>
<p>Ancelotti said earlier, per the Times: “Unfortunately, James had a problem during the game.</p>
<p>“He had a mistimed tackle with Virgil van Dijk at the beginning of the game and I think he will not be available for the game against Southampton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>View the challenge below:</p>
<p>The news about Rodriguez&rsquo;s set back has led to football fans on Twitter mocking Liverpool supporters for their reaction to Van Dijk&rsquo;s injury.</p>
<p>Just days after #RIPVirgil trended, #PrayForJames is now trending on Twitter. You can see some of the best tweets below:</p>
<p>The internet remains undefeated.</p>
<p>Ancelotti also said that the club were sorry about Van Dijk&rsquo;s injury and revealed Pickford is &lsquo;really disappointed&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be clear, we are really sorry for the injury of Virgil van Dijk,&rdquo; he said, per the Daily Mail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was this contact with Jordan Pickford: it was mistimed contact. But the fact the Premier League is so fast, it is not so difficult to arrive a little bit later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jordan arrived a little bit later but his intention was to try to reach the ball. It was not to hurt Virgil van Dijk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To say it was premeditated, and this and that, in my opinion, is too much. Virgil van Dijk knows this. Jordan is really sad, really disappointed [that Van Dijk is injured].</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a strong contact, maybe mistimed, but sometimes in football it can happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you know your history- perhaps Liverpool old boy needs a lesson?</p>

<p>Former Liverpool defender Jose Enrique looks like he could be guilty of wearing his red-tinted spectacles for an observation about neighbours Everton were discussing another of his old clubs Newcastle United.</p>
<p>Football Transfer Tavern quote Enrique as outlining to the Shields Gazette that Newcastle need new ownership to go to the next level.</p>
<p>He cited Everton as a potential model to follow looking at how they are progressing since the summer.</p>
<p>The Spaniard said:</p>
<p>“Every Newcastle fan, obviously, was really excited by the takeover, because it would have been an owner with a lot of money that maybe wanted to put Newcastle where they deserved to be. “I still believe Newcastle is a top-six team. Look, Everton is there, and it’s not because I’m a Liverpool fan, but Newcastle is bigger than Everton for history, for everything. It should be a top-six team. I believe that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bigger than Everton for history?</p>
<p>Other than current stadium capacity - don&rsquo;t forget unlike many major English cities like Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, Nottingham and even Bristol, Newcastle only has one professional team - by what measurement is Enrique employing to reach this theory?</p>
<p>The Magpies edge out the Blues 6-5 when it comes to FA Cup wins but three of Everton&rsquo;s successes have come since Newcastle last lifted the trophy in 1955.</p>
<p>In terms of League Championships, Everton have more than twice as many - 9 to 4 - with seven of those coming since the Toon last clinched the title way back in 1927 - the year before Dixie Dean netted his 60 goals.</p>
<p>Indeed, Newcastle United&rsquo;s last major honour, the 1968/69 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup only came about when they qualified despite finishing 10th in the First Division table the previous season because a bizarre one-club per city rule saw Everton (5th); Tottenham Hotspur (7th) and Arsenal (9th) all miss out.</p>
<p>When it comes to seasons spent in the English top flight, Football League founder members Everton are ahead of everyone else on 118 while Newcastle are seventh on the all-time list with 89, some 29 behind the Blues.

<p><img src="https://cdn.fantasyfootballscout.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020-09-13T172108Z_1996010599_UP1EG9D1C783T_RTRMADP_3_SOCCER-ENGLAND-TOT-EVE-REPORT-600x315.jpg" alt="img">
The first Friday night Fantasy Premier League deadline of the season is almost upon us, so we’re bringing you a bonus, earlier-than-usual team news article this week with a careful eye on the last-minute mayhem tomorrow.</p>
<p>The managers of Leeds United, Aston Villa, Fulham, Brighton and Hove Albion, Sheffield United, Burnley and West Bromwich Albion all held their official pre-Gameweek 6 press conferences either on Wednesday or Thursday, with Jose Mourinho and Brendan Rodgers set to face the media after their UEFA Europa League ties later this evening.</p>
<p>The headline injury news so far doesn’t come from any of those pressers, however, but from an interview that Carlo Ancelotti conducted with everton.tv.</p>
<p>We’ll round up the key updates below.</p>
<p>EVERTON</p>
<p>Carlo Ancelotti will face the wider media on Friday but he has already delivered an injury bombshell in an in-house interview, revealing that James Rodriguez (knock) is a major doubt for the clash with Southampton.</p>
<p>Seamus Coleman (hamstring) is also sidelined, with his manager saying:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, James [Rodriguez] had a problem during the [Liverpool] game. He had a mistimed tackle with Virgil van Dijk. I think he will not be available for the game against Southampton. Seamus Coleman had an injury during the [Liverpool] game, I think he will be out for two or three weeks. Jonjoe Kenny is back, he started training with the squad yesterday and I think he will be available for the next game.</p>
<p>CHAMPIONS LEAGUE/EUROPA LEAGUE CLUB UPDATES</p>
<p>Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola will face the media again on Friday but there were noteworthy comments from the Liverpool and Manchester City managers after their UEFA Champions League matches on Wednesday.</p>
<p>On Sadio Mane having an ice pack on his leg after being substituted, Klopp said:</p>
<p>Sadio has since a few days a dead leg and deals with that in that area. That’s the only thing why it’s still painful but it’s not a problem. When he doesn’t play, he puts ice on it.</p>
<p>Guardiola’s post-match comments raised the prospect of Kevin De Bruyne (muscle) and Aymeric Laporte (muscle) featuring in Gameweek 6, meanwhile, although Fernandinho (leg) has been ruled out for up to six weeks and Nathan Ake (groin) has a “niggle”.</p>
<p>I think Kevin [De Bruyne] and [Aymeric] Laporte will start training tomorrow. But I don’t know how it will be tomorrow and the next days. We will see. It is bad news [for Fernandinho]. It is a problem in his leg. I think he will be out for four to six weeks. It is a big blow for us, with the amount of games.</p>
<p>De Bruyne and Laporte were indeed spotted training in pictures released by the club on Thursday.</p>
<p>Jamie Vardy (calf), Dani Ceballos (ankle) and Willian (calf) will miss their respective clubs’ Europa League ties on Thursday and be assessed ahead of the clash between Arsenal and Leicester City on Sunday.</p>
<p>Rob Holding (hamstring) is out for three weeks for the Gunners but Shkodran Mustafi (hamstring) is back in full training and available for selection.</p>
<p>Eric Bailly looks set for a spell on the sidelines with Manchester United, meanwhile.</p>
<p>🗣️ Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed that Eric Bailly with be unavailable for three to four weeks with the injury that prevented him from facing Paris Saint-Germain last night.#FFScout #FPL #GW5 #MUFC #FantasyPL pic.twitter.com/CUREgwVAOM — Fantasy Football Scout (@FFScout) October 21, 2020</p>
<p>LEEDS UNITED</p>
<p>Marcelo Bielsa said that budget FPL defender Pascal Struijk will replace Kalvin Phillips (shoulder) in midfield for the trip to Aston Villa on Friday. Liam Cooper (groin) is still a doubt while Diego Llorente (muscle) remains out.</p>
<p>On Phillips, Bielsa said:</p>
<p>It is not defined how long he will be out for. It could be more or it could be less [than six weeks]. And the one who will play in his place is Pascal Struijk.</p>
<p>Asked if his squad was too small, the Leeds boss added:</p>
<p>The squad is not small, as we have two players per position. For example, we have Bamford and Roberts [up front], Moreno and Pablo [in attacking midfield], Costa and Poveda [on the right], Raphinha and Harrison [on the left]. Almost all of them, barring Bamford and Cooper, play in more than one position. The wingers play on both sides, the full-backs a lot of times do this as well, the defensive midfielders can act as centre-backs.</p>
<p>ASTON VILLA</p>
<p>Reserve striker Keinan Davis (calf) is expected to train on Thursday and come back into contention for Aston Villa’s clash with Leeds but Kortney Hause (muscle) remains out and joins longer-term absentees Wesley (knee) and Tom Heaton (knee) on the sidelines.</p>
<p>Dean Smith said of his improving defence, meanwhile:</p>
<p>I feel the energy and enthusiasm of Matt Cash has improved us. Ezri Konsa has got better and better, along with Tyrone, they’ve got a really good understanding now. Matt Targett has really improved and [we have] the steadiness behind them of Emi.</p>
<p>SHEFFIELD UNITED</p>
<p>Chris Wilder confirmed that Jack O’Connell (knee) is out for the season and estimated that Lys Mousset (toe) will be “back on the grass” in six to eight weeks.</p>
<p>John Fleck (back) will be out for the next month, while the Blades are waiting on a medical report on Max Lowe, who suffered a concussion in last week’s game against Fulham.</p>
<p>The Sheffield United boss said of Rhian Brewster‘s chances of starting, meanwhile:</p>
<p>It was a difficult decision last week as I talked about, but he has put himself right in the frame to be involved at the weekend and start. He’s at the forefront of our thinking. His natural ability and talent is there, we have seen that already but it’s just the physical and fitness side not opening him up to injury too soon. There’s always a decision about the timing of that – he’s been bright and bubbly and in our thoughts to start on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>BRIGHTON AND HOVE ALBION</p>
<p>New signing Danny Welbeck will be assessed for match fitness ahead of Brighton’s clash with West Brom, while goalkeeper Christian Walton is also back in training following his recovery from an ankle injury sustained in pre-season.</p>
<p>Alireza Jahanbakhsh (hamstring) and Jose Izquierdo (match fitness) aside, however, the fitness situation is rosy for the Seagulls.</p>
<p>Graham Potter said:</p>
<p>Only Alireza, just still recovering from his hamstring. Hasn’t trained today, so we’ll see how he is tomorrow and the upcoming days. So he’s probably the doubt at the moment, everybody else seems to be OK. Jose Izquierdo is having another spell with the under-23s tomorrow to build up some game-time. Apart from that, we’re fully fit. [Welbeck] has had two good days training with us and there will be two more sessions before the game. He’s kept himself in really good shape and we’re delighted with how he’s fitted into the group on and off the pitch. We’ll make a decision on Danny for Monday nearer the time.</p>
<p>Lewis Dunk begins a three-game ban.</p>
<p>BURNLEY</p>
<p>Sean Dyche brought us up to speed on the fitness latest with the Clarets, saying:</p>
<p>Matt Lowton is making good progress so he will be considered. Erik Pieters managed to get through the game (at West Brom) but he has got a minor calf injury, so he is a doubt – certainly, touch and go I think. Ben Mee’s getting better. He is not there yet but he’s back on the grass. He will need a bit of an extended period because he has been out quite a long period of time, so we will have to look after that side of things.</p>
<p>Jack Cork (ankle), Bailey Peacock-Farrell (hip) and Phil Bardsley (illness) remain out, along with Mee.</p>
<p>FULHAM AND WEST BROMWICH ALBION</p>
<p>Scott Parker told reporters on Thursday:</p>
<p>Injuries practically stay the same. Harrison Reed has trained with us the last couple of days.</p>
<p>Kenny Tete (calf), Josh Onomah (unspecified), Terence Kongolo (foot) and Joachim Andersen (ankle) remain out.</p>
<p>Slaven Bilić will be without Sam Field for “four to five weeks” after the midfielder suffered an injury to his left knee.</p>
<p>More detailed information and predicted line-ups can be found in the Team News tab, which will be refreshed before the Gameweek 6 deadline at 18:30 BST on Saturday.</p>

<h3 id="dominic-calvert-lewin-warning-richarlison-claim-ancelotti-backed">&ldquo;Dominic Calvert-Lewin warning, Richarlison claim, Ancelotti backed&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article19152456.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1280740792.jpg" alt="img">
Writing in his Daily Telegraph column, former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher discusses not just Jordan Pickford&rsquo;s challenge on Virgil van Dijk but the Everton goalkeeper&rsquo;s decision-making in general.</p>
<p>He says:</p>
<p>I cannot agree with the suggestion Jordan Pickford deliberately set out to hurt his rival. I know how both feel. For Van Dijk, the torment is physical. For Pickford, it is psychological.</p>
<p>As a player and now a pundit, you try to assess from a fellow professional&rsquo;s perspective and - as much as possible - to avoid being accused of double standards. That is why I looked beyond the raw feelings following Pickford’s tackle and saw it for what it was - reckless, not malicious.</p>
<p>Pickford did what I did against Nani. His initial movement was towards the ball, unaware of the man. When he realised he was too late and out of position, he panicked, lost control and dived in.</p>
<p>These were the actions of a player whose head is all over the place. It has been for a while.</p>
<p>Currently, every time Pickford makes a critical decision on the pitch, more often than not it turns out to be the wrong one. That one had serious repercussions for the Liverpool defender.</p>
<p>These are the horrendous situations we must occasionally deal with in the game. Bad injuries are an occupational hazard.</p>
<p>As professionals, there are demands upon us from coaching staff and fans to never shirk a tackle - especially in a derby.</p>
<p>I can assure you, when we do so our main concern is being aggressive to look after ourselves and help our team, not cause injury.</p>
<p>Equally, the pained reaction of Liverpool is not unique and I see hypocrisy in those who accuse my former club of going too far in their immediate response to it.</p>
<p>The sense of being wronged by key decisions inflamed an already volatile post-match situation. Because all this happened in a Merseyside derby and Pickford&rsquo;s challenge went unpunished, emotions were heightened.</p>
<p>As for the idiots on social media targeting Pickford or Richarlison, they are no more representative of Liverpool’s fanbase as those Evertonians who abused Wales’ Neil Taylor when he broke Seamus Coleman’s leg during an international in 2017, or Heung-Min Son after Andre Gomes suffered a year ago. Tellingly, the classiest responses after those incidents came from Coleman and Gomes.</p>
<p>The broader problem for Pickford and his manager Carlo Ancelotti is he cannot seem to avoid being under the spotlight every time he plays. For any player, that is a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>If a manager goes into every press conference knowing he is going to be asked about the same individual for negative reasons - as has again been the case for Ancelotti heading into Sunday&rsquo;s game at Southampton - he will be wondering if that player is really worth the hassle.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Pickford, at the moment he isn’t. Ancelotti is being quizzed about his keeper’s misjudgements as much as Everton’s performances, which is not a good place to be when a club is top of the Premier League.</p>
<p>What happened last weekend sums up Pickford’s career since the last World Cup. Every time he makes a mistake it has repercussions.</p>
<p>We are not talking about a blip. Pickford has been poor for 18 months, which is why Ancelotti’s next major signing has to be new number one. The attention on Pickford’s tackle distracted from another sub-standard display.

<h3 id="james-rodriguez-reportedly-injured-following-collision-with-van-dijk">&ldquo;James Rodriguez reportedly injured following collision with Van Dijk&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.rousingthekop.com/static/uploads/4/2019/03/iphone-icon.png" alt="img">
Everton will be without their talisman James Rodriguez this weekend after the Columbia international was confirmed as injured following a collision with Virgil van Dijk last week according to The ECHO.</p>
<p>Rodriguez, 29, will miss Sunday’s match with Southampton as a result. Seamus Coleman was also confirmed as an absentee.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, James had a problem during the game,” Ancelotti said.</p>
<p>“He had a mistimed tackle with Virgil van Dijk at the beginning of the game and I think he will not be available for the game against Southampton.”</p>
<p>BBC pundit Danny Murphy revealed to The Mail after the match that Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp purposely exploited Everton’s Rodriguez during the 2-2 draw.</p>
<p>He said: “They [Everton] look better than they’ve done for years and, in James Rodriguez, have a player with real star quality. But the better teams will have seen how you can exploit the Colombian’s lack of willingness to track back when the opposition left-back is bombing forward.</p>
<p>“Andy Robertson capitalised. Liverpool were a real threat down that side and of course, that’s how they took an early lead with the full-back crossing for Mane.”</p>
<p>Pickford sorry for Van Dijk incident</p>
<p>Van Dijk, 29, himself later suffered an injury following a tangling with Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford which forced an ACL tear which is expected to keep the Dutchman out of action for the season as he awaits surgery.</p>
<p>Ancelotti claimed that Pickford was left “really sad” following the incident but denied the tackle was premeditated.</p>
<p>“To be clear, we are really sorry for the injury of Virgil van Dijk,” Ancelotti said.</p>
<p>“Every one of us hopes he can recover soon and well.”</p>
<p>Pickford will face no further action for the challenge as the Football Association determined the incident was seen at the time having consulted with the match officials, including the video assistant referee David Coote.</p>
<p>Previewing Sheffield United</p>
<p>Van Dijk will miss Saturday’s encounter with Sheffield United which could see a return to Anfield for former striker Rhian Brewster.</p>
<p>Ahead of the match, United manager Chris Wilder claimed that the Blades were grappling with an even bigger injury nightmare than Liverpool with the loss of Van Dijk.</p>
<p>Blades defender Jack O’Connell may also be missing for the campaign with a knee injury, while the Blades are also currently without midfielder John Fleck and striker Lys Mousset.</p>
<p>The South Yorkshire side travel to Anfield on Saturday and speaking in his pre-match press conference ahead of the game, Wilder said: “It’s all relative. Us losing Fleck, Jack O’Connell and Lys is, I’d say, a bigger loss than losing van Dijk, relatively.</p>
<p>“All clubs go through these periods and situations. They still have world-class players and an academy that produces players all the time.</p>
<p>“And those three at the top of the pitch (Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino) can hurt anyone.”
