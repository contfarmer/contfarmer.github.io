<p>BIG BROTHER totally changed the game when it first aired back in 2000 - and now Davina McCall and Rylan Clark-Neal are looking back at THAT Jackie Stallone episode.</p>
<p>To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the landmark show - and keep us entertained in lockdown, the former Big Brother hosts are digging out the best EVER episodes from the archives.</p>
<p>And we’ve got BB legend Aisleyne Horgan Wallace blogging live throughout every show - here’s what she’s got to say about those best bits&hellip;</p>
<p>Where are the most memorable Big Brother contestants now?</p>
<p>Who is Davina dating?

<h3 id="woman-pretended-to-be-pop-star-to-get-on-celebrity-big-brother">&ldquo;Woman pretended to be pop star to get on Celebrity Big Brother&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article22195051.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_celeb_bb_13_wenn429106.jpg" alt="img">
Chantelle Houghton applied to be a contestant on Big Brother, liking her chances of winning over the nation&rsquo;s hearts on what was the UK&rsquo;s biggest TV show.</p>
<p>But she wasn&rsquo;t successful - but the producers offered her a very different opportunity in the house.</p>
<p>She was given a spot in the celebrity version of the show in 2006, but she was only allowed to stay if she managed to convince her housemates that she wasn&rsquo;t a receptionist from Essex, but was actually the lead singer of the fictional girlband Kandy Floss.</p>
<p>Before she walked through the door of the famous house, 22-year-old Chantelle had just 80p in her bank account and she still lived with her mum and step-dad.</p>
<p>(Image: PA)</p>
<p>She ended up walking out the door as the CelebrityBig Brother winner - earning a massive 56 per cent of the public vote - with the £25,000 cash prize, which changed her life.</p>
<p>She was the first housemate to enter the 2006 house and was called straight to the Diary Room.</p>
<p>She was then told: &ldquo;Chantelle, as you know, this is Celebrity Big Brother but you are not a celebrity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were told that there would be a mixture of celebrities and non-celebrities in the Big Brother house.</p>
<p>(Image: Unknown)</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be the only housemate who is not a celebrity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She then asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the catch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Big Brother continued: &ldquo;In order to stay in the Celebrity Big Brother house, you must earn celebrity status.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To do this you must complete a secret mission. Your secret mission is to convince the other celebrities that you are in fact a genuine celebrity.</p>
<p>If you succeed you will have earned the right to stay in the Big Brother house, if you fail you will be evicted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Image: Unknown)</p>
<p>She was given an envelope which contained details of the celebrity she had to pretend she had to be for the challenge.</p>
<p>She was to pretend to be a pop star in the girl group Kandy Floss, whose hit single was called I Want it Right Now.</p>
<p>She got to work straight away trying to convince her housemates that she was a singer, and was even asked to perform her hit song for one of the tasks.</p>
<p>She was given lyrics and headphones in advance and had to learn the entire song and memorise it in the Diary Room - with hilarious results.</p>
<p>The rest of the house watched on as the self-confessed terrible singer attempted to perform the fake hit through fake smiles and awkward glances.</p>
<p>Among the celeb housemates she managed to convince were Pete Burns, George Galloway, Michael Barrymore and Dennis Rodman.</p>
<p>During the show she struck up a romance with Ordinary Boys front-man Preston, and they went on to marry but divorced after a year.</p>
<p>Since being on the show, Chantelle has written a column for magazine, released two books and an exercise DVD and had her own fly-on-the-wall documentary.</p>
<p>(Image: WireImage.com)</p>
<p>Speaking afterwards, Chantelle spoke about her ambitions to become a TV presenter.</p>
<p>She has also spoken of her battles with her weight and how she now believes life is too short to worry about it.</p>
<p>She appeared on reality series Bodyshockers, where she opened up about her regrets over getting a huge boob job and has since had the implants removed and vowed never to have surgery again.</p>
<p>(Image: REX)</p>
<p>Speaking about how much money she made after leaving the show on Loose Women, she said: &ldquo;It scares me to even think about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be the first person to admit it, is is like a rags to riches story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more money than I could have ever dreamed of. It&rsquo;s a hell of a lot of money that I would never have earned in my whole lifetime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just so happy to be in there, I had such a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chantelle left school at 15 and got a job as a trainee receptionist.</p>
<p>Even though she did enjoy, she admits it was tough watching her friends still living as teenagers while she went to the office.</p>
<p>She told Closer: &ldquo;I got a job as a trainee receptionist, which I really enjoyed, but everyone went to the pub at lunchtime and because I was so young I would sit on a park bench on my own and eat my sandwich, feeling sorry for myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was working long hours while my friends were still being teenagers, but I loved being able to treat myself.&rdquo;

Jedward are dishing out DMs and everyone wants in (Picture: Rex)</p>
<p>Jedward have once again proven themselves to be the icons we never knew we needed by sending out a ton of personalised DMs.</p>
<p>Your faves could never. Unless your faves are Jedward, in which case they very well could.</p>
<p>The Irish twins – real names John and Edward Grimes – rose to fame on the X Factor way back in 2009 (anyone feeling old yet?).</p>
<p>And they’ve once again captured our hearts, dropping people sweet DMs as everyone wonders what on earth is going on.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>‘Jedward DM’ing me at nearly 3AM is a thing apparently,’ one fan wrote, while another added: ‘Do Jedward randomly DM people or what I’m so confused.’</p>

<p>‘When Jedward DM you to send you good vibes and smiles you have no choice but to accept good vibes and smiles,’ one more pointed out.</p>

<p>However, those who haven’t been chosen for a DM from the Lipstick singers are clearly not too pleased, with one unlucky soul writing: ‘Feel like s**t just want jedward to dm me.’</p>
<p>‘Jedward this is me shamelessly asking for a DM,’ another requested, and we can’t even blame them.</p>

<p>The twins, who became best pals with Tara when they starred on Big Brother together in 2017, were already staying with the 44-year-old before the coronavirus caused a universal lockdown but briefly returned to Ireland for a St. Partrick’s Day gig.</p>
<p>And they were keen to open up about their friendship during a recent appearance on Loose Women.</p>
<p>‘I feel Big Brother is a place which brought us close and coming out of the house, we’ve got even closer because we had so much life experience together,’ John explained.</p>
<p>‘We’ve traveled the world, she came to Ireland.’</p>
<p>Tara, who was one of the most talked-about stars of the noughties, admitted she had no idea she was rubbing shoulders with two pop icons.</p>
<p>‘They took me to a show in Sweden and I didn’t realise how famous they were!’ she gasped. ‘There was like 1,000 girls outside their hotel.’</p>
<p>Girl, wait until you see their DMs.</p>

<h3 id="kevin-durant-the-union-and-mls-celebrity">&ldquo;Kevin Durant, the Union, and MLS celebrity&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.ussoccerplayers.com/images/2020/06/philadelphia-union-logo-560x373.jpg" alt="img">
By Jason Davis – WASHINGTON, DC (Jun 17, 2020) US Soccer Players - On Monday, NBA star Kevin Durant officially became a minority investor/operator of the Philadelphia Union, purchasing 5% of the team. Per Union majority investor/operator Jay Sugarman, the Union is worth $325 million, putting Durant&rsquo;s stake at $16.25 million. Durant also holds an option to purchase an additional 5% of the team in the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a fan of the sport, and then seeing how fast the popularity of the league was growing, seeing more fans pop up in different cities around the country, and then seeing how these franchises impact the city&rsquo;s businesses and people individually was very intriguing,&rdquo; Durant told ESPN.</p>
<p>Durant follows fellow NBA stars LeBron James and James Harden into soccer club ownership. James owns a small piece of Liverpool Football Club in England, while Harden invested in the Houston Dynamo last year.</p>
<p>Like the Dynamo with Harden coming on board, the Union made sure to stress the star power joining its ownership group. League and team social media highlighted Durant&rsquo;s belief in the sport. As one of the best basketball players on the planet, he brings with him a cachet that MLS often lacks, especially in American sporting circles.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no denying Durant&rsquo;s star power. There&rsquo;s a reasonable chance that his name is better known, even in Philadelphia, than the Union brand itself. While MLS has grown leaps and bounds in recent years, it remains a niche product off-the-radar of most sports fans in America.</p>
<p>Durant&rsquo;s arrival as a Union owner helps the club and, by extension, MLS crossover into the mainstream sports conversation. For at least a day, talking heads and radio hosts paid a modicum of attention to America&rsquo;s top soccer league when discussing Durant&rsquo;s move into ownership. Even a passing mention represents value gained for Philadelphia, especially in a town that tends to treat the Union as a humorous afterthought.</p>
<p>Harden&rsquo;s purchase of a share of the Dynamo generated similar headlines last July. Harden posed with a Dynamo jersey bearing his name and number. He delivered similar quotes to those made by Durant, though he notably didn&rsquo;t claim to be a longtime fan of the sport. The Dynamo squeezed some internet-ready content out of Harden&rsquo;s investment, posting pictures of the team roster with every player sporting a Harden-style beard.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no hard and fast level of involvement for taking a minority stake in an MLS club. The celebrity factor increases the scrutiny, but in big picture terms it&rsquo;s the investment itself that matters. If Harden chooses to use his celebrity to promote soccer and the Dynamo, that represents a bonus for the club.</p>
<p>MLS is in a unique position as an investment opportunity for celebrities in general. Because MLS is an up-and-coming league with a strong presence in several major markets, it&rsquo;s an attractive opportunity for wealthy celebrities and athletes who can afford to acquire a small portion of a club. It&rsquo;s a change in scope from Michael Jordan buying an NBA team or Magic Johnson part of the investment group that owns the LA Dodgers.</p>
<p>Johnson is also a minority owner of LAFC. He&rsquo;s part of a group of MLS celebrity investor/operators that includes the likes of Durant, Harden, Oscar De La Hoya (another minority owner of the Dynamo), Russell Westbrook (part of the celebrity-laden group that took control of the Seattle Sounders last year), Will Ferrell (LAFC), and Matthew McConaughey (Austin FC), among others who have thrown their support behind soccer in the United States.</p>
<p>Soccer has cache. More popular with young people than with their elders, it&rsquo;s a global sport that connects MLS investors to a network that reaches around the world. MLS may not hold an elevated position in the planetary hierarchy of leagues, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it sits outside of the soccer community. When it comes to the value of an MLS investment, access to the halls of that power is part of the appeal.</p>
<p>Durant sounds earnest about his desire to not just help soccer grow and turn the Union into a powerhouse franchise, but aid the Chester community where the Union plays. A firm he runs with sports agent Rich Kleiman, Thirty Five Ventures, will work within the community through Durant&rsquo;s charity foundations. There are other celebrity owners in MLS with charitable foundations, a potential source of involvement that is worth stressing.</p>
<p>Sports ownership is unique as an investment. Unlike most businesses, there&rsquo;s a public-facing participatory element available. In some cases, MLS has benefited from celebrities who bought fully into being investor-fans. There&rsquo;s only so much a minority investor can do in MLS, but going to the games and supporting the team is always valuable.</p>
<p>Considering where MLS sits in the American sports conversation, MLS and the Union likely hope for a bit more than that. Soccer may be on the rise, with MLS both fueling it and benefiting from it. Still, this is a league that needs its celebrity support.</p>

<p>bites often go unnoticed, as you usually won&rsquo;t feel or see them, unless you know what you&rsquo;re looking for. It&rsquo;s important to check for ticks after you&rsquo;re in nature, as early recognition and treatment of a tick bite can help prevent any health complications.</p>
<p>complications. Some ticks can spread tick-borne illnesses, such as Lyme disease , which appear with more noticeable symptoms about three to 30 days after a tick bite.</p>
<p>, which appear with more noticeable symptoms about three to 30 days after a tick bite. This article was medically reviewed by Mona Gohara, MD, a dermatologist at the Yale School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Tick bites are notoriously difficult to spot. That&rsquo;s because ticks have a trick up their sleeves. When they bite you, the tick saliva acts as a painkiller, numbing the area so you don&rsquo;t feel it.</p>
<p>As a result, you may not always notice if a tick has bitten you until it falls off, or if you have an allergic reaction.</p>

<p>What are ticks?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some types of ticks can pass harmful diseases on to humans, and it&rsquo;s important to be aware of the signs of tick-borne illness, which can appear anywhere from three to 30 days after a tick bite.Here&rsquo;s how to recognize tick bites and tick-borne illnesses, when to seek medical attention, and how to prevent them in the first place.</p>

<p>Ticks are small, blood-sucking parasites that live outside in grass, leaf piles, trees, and shrubs. They are a type of arachnid, closely related to spiders.</p>
<p>When a tick bites, it will attach to the skin of people or animals, feeding on the blood of whatever host it finds.</p>
<p>Tick bite symptoms</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>People encounter ticks outdoors, usually in wooded, grassy or bushy areas. While tick bites can occur year-round, you&rsquo;re more likely to come into contact with them during warmer weather, from April to September, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Tick bites are nearly impossible to feel, says Andres Romero , MD, infectious disease specialist at Providence Saint John&rsquo;s Health Center.</p>
<p>Romero advises removing your clothes after spending time in grassy or wooded areas and checking for ticks, paying close attention to places where your skin folds. Because once a tick gets on your body, it&rsquo;s likely to migrate to warm and moist areas like your armpit or groin.</p>
<p>If a tick does bite you and you don&rsquo;t notice, it will fall off on its own after a few days. Your skin will likely become red and itchy at the spot after the tick falls off. Many people don&rsquo;t realize they&rsquo;ve been bitten by a tick until this point.</p>

<p>Hives</p>
<p>Pain, swelling, or a burning sensation at the bite site</p>
<p>However, others can experience an allergic reaction to a tick bite, indicated by the following symptoms once the tick bites you:</p>
<p>According to Romero, most people should be able to manage these symptoms at home with an over-the-counter antihistamine medication, like Benadryl, but it never hurts to get a doctor&rsquo;s guidance if you&rsquo;re worried your reaction might be severe.</p>
<p>If you have trouble breathing, you should seek medical attention immediately, as this can be a sign of a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis.</p>

<p>Some types of ticks can transmit diseases to humans and animals. In most cases, a tick needs to be attached and feeding for at least 24 hours to transmit disease, Romero says.</p>
<p>Examples of tick-borne illnesses include:</p>
<p>Lyme Disease. Signs include a circular rash within three to 30 days of a tick bite, followed by the onset of a fever. The infection can spread to the joints, heart and nervous system, and if left untreated, it can cause long-term joint pain.</p>
<p>Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) . Signs include a fever, muscle aches, headache, and a rash of flat, pink, non-itchy spots that appear on the wrists, forearms, and ankles. RMSF can be fatal if not treated with antibiotics within five days of illness.</p>
<p>. Signs include a fever, muscle aches, headache, and a rash of flat, pink, non-itchy spots that appear on the wrists, forearms, and ankles. RMSF can be fatal if not treated with antibiotics within five days of illness. Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness (STARI). Signs include a circular rash similar to the one associated with Lyme Disease. Other symptoms include fever, headache and joint pain.</p>
<p>Signs include a circular rash similar to the one associated with Lyme Disease. Other symptoms include fever, headache and joint pain. Tularemia. Signs include a skin ulcer that appears at the tick bite site, and swelling of lymph glands in the armpit or groin. It can be life-threatening without treatment, but is usually treated effectively with antibiotics, according to the CDC.</p>

<p>Not all types of ticks carry disease. You may be more at risk for tick-borne illness depending on where you live</p>
<p>For example, the ticks that cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever are predominantly located in the Northwest region of the United States, and the Western blacklegged tick, which can transmit Lyme disease, is predominant in northern California.</p>
<p>How to prevent tick bites</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Wear protective clothing. For example, Romero suggests covering your ankles if you&rsquo;re going to be out hiking, since ticks are likely to come into contact with you on the ground.</p>
<p>Use an insect repellent registered by the Environmental Protection Agency, that contains DEET — the most common active ingredient in insect repellent products. Studies have shown DEET to be effective in preventing tick bites.</p>
<p>Avoid wooded or bushy areas with tall grass, and walk in the center of trails when hiking or in the woods.</p>
<p>When you do come inside, thoroughly check your body and clothing for ticks. You can tumble dry clothes on high heat for 10 minutes to kill ticks.</p>
<p>Shower after being outside. If you do have a tick on you, it may not attach itself right away and showering can wash away any unattached ticks.</p>
<p>How to treat a tick bite</p>
<p>Early recognition and treatment decrease the risk of serious complications from all of these illnesses, Romero says. You should consult a doctor if you develop a fever or any of these other symptoms after a tick bite.The best way to avoid tick-borne illnesses is to protect yourself against ticks in the first place. Some best practices for decreasing your risk of tick exposure include:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to always check for ticks after being outside, as the prompt removal of a tick is the best treatment against illness or infection. For more information, follow these 6 simple steps to remove a tick correctly.</p>
<p>After removal, or once the tick falls off, the bite site can become red and itchy. You may want to use calamine lotion to relieve itching, or a local anesthetic spray that contains benzocaine to reduce any pain at the site.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>If you do develop signs of a tick-borne illness, your doctor will likely prescribe an antibiotic, such as doxycycline or amoxicillin. This can help treat an illness like Lyme disease and prevent more severe symptoms from occurring.</p>
<p>Antibiotics are the standard form of treatment for tick-borne illness, and they are very effective when used properly.</p>
<p>For Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, you may only need to use antibiotics for a week, but for Lyme Disease, you could take them for two to three weeks in order to treat your condition.</p>

<p>The length of time you may need to take antibiotics will also depend on how early you catch your illness and seek treatment. Overall, for all tick-borne diseases, the sooner you seek medical attention, the better.

<p><img src="https://www.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/celebrities/2020061891862/kate-garraway-message-costar-amid-husband-derek-health-battle/0-440-301/kate-garraway-message-t.jpg" alt="img">
Kate Garraway has been facing the heartache of waiting for news on her husband Derek Draper&rsquo;s health, after he was rushed to hospital with coronavirus at the end of March. However, the Good Morning Britain star is still thinking of others during this devastating time, and on Thursday, she took to Instagram to share a sweet message on Eamonn Holmes&rsquo; birthday tribute to his daughter Rebecca, simply replying to it with a series of love heart emojis. Over the past few weeks, Eamonn and the rest of Kate&rsquo;s ITV co-stars have been showing their support for her and her two young children, Darcey, 14, and William, ten.</p>

<p>VIDEO: Kate Garraway reveals husband Derek&rsquo;s heartbreaking final words before going into a coma</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Kate&rsquo;s good friend and GMB co-star Piers Morgan gave an update on Derek&rsquo;s condition in an emotional article for the Mail on Sunday. In it, Piers opened up about the heartbreaking conversation he had with the mother-of-two shortly after Derek was taken to hospital, and how Kate has since described the situation as a &ldquo;living hell.&rdquo; The TV personality recalled that he had phoned Kate as soon as he heard about Derek being taken to A&amp;E, saying: &ldquo;I phoned Kate immediately and we had a long, heart-rending conversation, one of many we&rsquo;ve had since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate Garraway sent Eamonn Holmes a sweet message on his daughter&rsquo;s birthday</p>
<p>He continued: &ldquo;It’s so hard to know what to say in such situations. I knew GMB’s Dr Hilary Jones would be giving her all the expert medical advice she needed (as he very kindly does for all of us on the team when we have family health issues), so instead I gave her the only suggestion I could think of that might actually help such a good, experienced journalist – to treat what was happening like a massive breaking news story and behave accordingly. It’s the mentality I’ve always tried to use myself when I’ve faced any kind of professional or personal crisis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The GMB star bravely opened up about Derek&rsquo;s health battle last month</p>
<p>While Kate has been incredibly brave and has been following her co-star&rsquo;s advice, the I&rsquo;m a Celebrity star admitted to Piers recently that the situation was a &ldquo;living hell.&rdquo; She said: &ldquo;I keep saying I can’t bear it, but then somehow do. It’s managing feelings and holding in the same moment your greatest hope, greatest fear and total uncertainty about which way it’s going to go – all the time. I don’t think I’ve ever loved him more or felt more at risk of losing him. But at least I still have hope, which lots of people have had taken away from them. I am going to watch Darkest Hour tonight, cry properly and fight back tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derek was rushed to hospital ten weeks ago</p>
<p>At the beginning of May, Kate appeared on GMB to talk about Derek&rsquo;s health battle, where she revealed that he was now coronavirus-free, but that it had caused havoc to his body, including his heart and liver. The doting mum also opened up about the impact Derek&rsquo;s illness has had on her children in a recent interview with The Sun, telling Jane Moore that her son now sleeps next to his dad&rsquo;s empty bed each evening to feel close to him.</p>
