<p><img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-01/f747m5no_sushant-singh-rajput_625x300_15_January_19.jpg" alt="img">
Actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai home.</p>
<p>Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his home in Mumbai, police said today, confirming his suicide. He was 34.</p>
<p>The popular actor was recently seen in the film &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo; - which dealt with the extreme pressure of college and competitive exams. His last appearance was in the Netflix film &ldquo;Drive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput had put up a moving post just last week when his former manager Disha Salian was found dead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such devastating news,&rdquo; the actor had written on Instagram.</p>
<p>His last post on Instagram was dedicated to his mother, whose death in 2002 left him devastated. &ldquo;Blurred past evaporating from teardrops, unending dreams carving an arc of smile And a fleeting life, negotiating between the two,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Rajput, who became a household name with his hit television series &ldquo;Pavitra Rishta&rdquo;, debuted in films in 2013 with the critically acclaimed &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&rdquo; based on Chetan Bhagat&rsquo;s bestselling book &ldquo;The Three Mistakes of My Life&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The movie catapulted Rajput into the big league and he went on to do several films. He also played MS Dhoni in the former skipper&rsquo;s biopic, for which he was nominated for film awards.</p>
<p>He played the eponymous role of Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! in the 2015 thriller. He had a supporting role in Aamir Khan&rsquo;s 2014 hit PK. In 2018, Rajput starred in Kedarnath opposite debutante Sara Ali Khan.</p>
<p>Rajput was born in Patna. He studied engineering and was a National Olympiad Winner in Physics.</p>
<p>He said in interviews that after his involvement in theatre and dance, he rarely had time for studies. He eventually dropped out of engineering just a year short of his degree to pursue an acting career.</p>
<p>A shell-shocked film industry posted tributes on Twitter. &ldquo;Honestly this news has left me shocked and speechless&hellip;I remember watching #SushantSinghRajput in Chhichhore and telling my friend Sajid, its producer how much I&rsquo;d enjoyed the film and wish I&rsquo;d been a part of it. Such a talented actor&hellip;may God give strength to his family,&rdquo; Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No No No!!!!! Horrible heartbreaking news of the passing of #SushantSinghRajput ! Shocking &amp; sad beyond words!!! Goodbye Sushant.. you were such a wonderful performer and had such a long long way to go! Don&rsquo;t know what you were going through but I&rsquo;m sorry for your suffering! Red heart (sic),&rdquo; Swara Bhaskar posted, condoling his death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The news of Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s death is truly sad. What a tragic loss Deepest condolences to his family &amp; loved ones. May his soul find eternal peace,&rdquo; actor Ajay Devgn wrote.</p>
<p>Abhishek Bachchan tweeted: &ldquo;This is just so shocking. A wonderful talent. RIP Sushant&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Last month, death of seasoned actors - Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan - left the country in grief and shock.</p>

<h3 id="from-shoba-to-sushant-singh-rajput-a-look-at-suicides-in-indian-cinema">&ldquo;From Shoba to Sushant Singh Rajput: A look at suicides in Indian cinema&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.manoramaonline.com/content/dam/mm/en/entertainment/entertainment-news/images/2020/6/15/sushant-soba-silk-smitha-suicide.jpg" alt="img">
The curse of suicide has haunted the showbiz since time immemorial with the likes of iconic actor-director Guru Dutt, South star Shoba, Silk Smitha, actor Jiah Khan and now Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput giving up on life in the Indian film industry known for being harsh and demanding of its stars.</p>
<p>Known for films like &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&quot;, &ldquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo;, Rajput was found hanging at his Bandra home, the police said on Sunday. He was 34.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: Shocking suicides: Actors who stunned us with their sudden exits</p>
<p>Rajput&rsquo;s last screen appearance was Nitesh Tiwari&rsquo;s 2019 film Chhichhore. And his last social media post, dedicated to his late mother who died in 2002 when he was a young teen, was on June 3, a foretelling perhaps on what to come.</p>
<p>Rajput&rsquo;s sudden death comes days after his former manager, 28-year-old Disha Salian, ended her life by jumping from a high rise building on June 9.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt, known for black-and-white classics like &ldquo;Kaagaz Ke Phool&rdquo;, &ldquo;Baazi&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Pyaasa&rdquo;, was found dead on October 10, 1964 in his bed in his rented apartment at Pedder Road in erstwhile Bombay. He was 39. The filmmaker, whose real name was Vasanth Kumar Shivashankar Padukone, was said to have been mixing alcohol and sleeping pills.</p>
<p>Dutt&rsquo;s death may have been suicide or just an accidental overdose. His son, Arun Dutt, considered the death to be an accident.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt</p>
<p>South star Mahalakshmi Menon, best known by her stagename Shoba committed suicide at the age of 17. She got herself a National Award for Best Actress for the film Pasi and on May 1, 1980, she was found to have killed herself in her house in Chennai, then Madras. The manner of Shoba’s death, however, still remains cloaked in mystery.</p>
<p>Four years after Shoba died, her mother Prema who was also an actress too killed herself. KG George&rsquo;s 1983 film Lekhayude Maranam – Oru Flashback is said to be loosely based on her life.</p>
<p>Actor Vijaylakshmi, who reached the iconic status of a sex symbol in Tamil cinema during her time, as Silk Smitha died at the age of 33 as the result of a suspected suicide in 1996. She appeared in over 200 films, including &ldquo;Vandichakkaram&rdquo;, &ldquo;Moondru Mugam&rdquo;, a most sought after actor at a time was said to be neck deep in controversies.</p>
<p>Silk Smitha</p>
<p>She was immortalised on screen in the 2011 film &ldquo;The Dirty Picture&rdquo;, starring Vidya Balan as Silk. The Milan Luthria-directed film, which showed the highs and lows of the dancing star, was inspired by the actor&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Former Miss India and video jockey Nafisa Joseph was found hanging at her residence in Versova in 2004 at the age of 25.</p>
<p>Joseph, who won the Miss India title in 1997, had worked as a model and had been involved in activities related to animal rights.</p>
<p>In 2006, model-turned television actor Kuljeet Randhawa, known for starring in high-school drama &ldquo;Hip Hip Hurray!&quot;, suspense serial &ldquo;Kohinoor&rdquo; and crime thriller drama &ldquo;Special Squad&rdquo;, allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself in her single room apartment in suburban Juhu. She was 25.</p>
