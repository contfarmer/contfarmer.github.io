<p>A nine-year-old Chris Tomlin once told his dad that when he grew up, he’d be one of two things: A professional baseball player or a country music singer.</p>
<p>“I missed the mark a little bit on that one,” Tomlin, a Grammy Award-winning worship songwriter and performer, said with a laugh.</p>
<p>Spoiler: Tomlin isn’t pitching shutouts in the majors. But, with the release of his latest album, “Chris Tomlin and Friends,” this applauded Christian artist finds his way to at least pinch hitting in a new league alongside some of Nashville’s top country-pop hitmakers.</p>
<p>With “Chris Tomlin and Friends,” the Nashville-based Texas native unifies worship music he’s been delivering for more than two decades with the sound of a modern Music Row, enlisting the likes of Thomas Rhett, Lady A, Cassadee Pope, Brett Young and others for collaborations.</p>
<p>Florida Georgia Line collaborated with Tomlin on multiple songs and served as executive producers on the album; chart-topping songwriter Corey Crowder produced a dozen “Chris Tomlin and Friends” songs.</p>
<p>“This is definitely a different sound than anything I’ve done,” Tomlin said, adding: “What would it sound like for our worlds to collide? &hellip; I think you hear that a lot on this record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A chance meeting</p>
<p>Although Tomlin didn’t know it at the time, the “Friends” project began while he was on vacation with his family last year in Florida.</p>
<p>During his beachside visit, Tomlin took a trip to the gym and found one other person in the room: Florida Georgia Line’s Tyler Hubbard. He decided to introduce himself, but wasn’t ready for the reply that waited.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘Hey, man. I’m Chris Tomlin,’ and I’ll never forget,” Tomlin said, “he looks at me and he goes, ‘For real? This is crazy &hellip; you’re one of the reasons I’m in music.’ That’s not what I thought was coming.”</p>
<p>At that chance visit, Tomlin said he learned Hubbard began listening to his music in eighth grade and, years later at Belmont University, connected with Brian Kelley through worship before properly forming the country-pop powerhouse Florida Georgia Line.</p>
<p>“I started feeling my age pretty quickly,” Tomlin joked: “I was so floored, honestly. (Hubbard) said, ‘Bro, there’s two reasons I’m in music: Chris Tomlin and Garth Brooks.’ I was trying to get my head around that.”</p>
<p>A few weeks later, Tomlin was back in Nashville for his annual Good Friday concert at Bridgestone Arena. He tried for six months to ask Thomas Rhett to be that year’s special guest, but couldn’t get a word through management or mutual friends to the “Life Changes” singer.</p>
<p>But, backstage during a soundcheck, he ran into the second encounter that would lead to “Friends”: Rhett rehearsing for his upcoming summer tour.</p>
<p>“(He goes), ‘Man, we should get together and write some songs,’” Tomlin said. “This is all happening in the same couple of weeks. Like, what? This is crazy.”</p>
<p>‘Out of the blue’</p>
<p>The “hello” and handshake meetings led to no-pressure writing sessions and, eventually, Tomlin found himself collaborating with a slew of only-in-Nashville possibilities.</p>
<p>Tomlin, Hubbard and company began “connecting the dots” to others who could sing and write on “Friends.”</p>
<p>He enlisted “Every Little Thing” singer and former Tomlin guitar tech Russell Dickerson for a Florida Georgia Line (FGL) collaboration titled “Sing”; rising singer RaeLynn takes lead on the spiritual “Chase Me Down”; Dan + Shay singer Shay Mooney co-wrote “Reaching For You,” a collaboration with Christian outfit We The Kingdom.</p>
<p>“All these relationships are happening out of the blue,” Tomlin said. “There was nobody behind the scenes, pulling the levers. It was just this collaboration that really happened in a very organic way. Out of relationships that I didn’t see coming, that I don’t think they saw coming.”</p>
<p>He added: “This was not in the plan. This was something that was never really in my mind to do.”</p>
<p>To kickstart the record, Tomlin and Rhett join forces with FGL for standout collaboration “Thank You Lord.” Tomlin points to this number as an example of how contemporary country meets modern worship music on the record.</p>
<p>The song starts with Rhett offering a conversational verse and chorus. He sings, “For my mama, for my friends/ For Your love, it never ends &hellip; Yeah, I just gotta say, thank you Lord,” he sings. After the second chorus, Tomlin delivers “praise up, eyes closed,” a line akin to his familiar worship tunes.</p>
<p>For Tomlin, the project flexed “different muscles” with songwriting and language.</p>
<p>“Let’s not think about this as a worship song or a country song,” Tomlin said. “Some of it is very much down the line of their country smashes and there’s other songs that you can hear a lot of me on.”</p>
<p>As host to a squad of “Friends” on the album, Tomlin said he wasn’t afraid to ride the bench as needed. The album doesn’t follow a traditional duet format, where each guest artist sings the second verse and maybe a chorus harmony.</p>
<p>Tomlin doesn’t join some songs, such as “Thank You Lord” or FGL collaboration “Forever Home,” until deep into the cut. Others, such as “Chase Me Down,” he can be heard exclusively singing harmony.</p>
<p>“This is a different record, and I can’t go into everybody’s home and explain it,” Tomlin said. “But I hope people feel that. This is truly all of us together.”</p>
<p>And, yes, “Friends” may sound different from the dozen Tomlin albums before it or the modern worship staples sung by church-goers each Sunday, but faith remains at the forefront of the project’s songwriting.</p>
<p>Reflecting &lsquo;a greater light&rsquo;</p>
<p>He points to the moon, literally, for one example of faith on “Friends.” Album track “Be The Moon,” featuring Brett Young and Cassadee Pope, delivers a message about why musicians write and perform Christian music.</p>
<p>The first verse offers, “Everybody wants to be somebody/ I wanna be somebody too/ If I&rsquo;m gonna be known for something/ I wanna be known for you.”</p>
<p>Light doesn’t shine from artists singing worship songs on stage, Tomlin said, but instead reflects a “greater light,” like the moon does.</p>
<p>“It’s the essence of our faith,” Tomlin said. “The moon is not striving to be anything else. It’s just what it is. It reflects a greater light. It reflects a light into a dark place.”</p>
<p>And it was just one turn in a winding path that pushed Tomlin into a league with a handful of new “Friends.”</p>
<p>“It was like a river that was just going,” Tomlin said. “Wherever the current was going, we were going. And it kept changing. It kept winding.</p>
<p>“What an incredible, creative thing to be able to do.”</p>

<h3 id="chris-tomlin-shares-the-stories-behind-chris-tomlin-and-friends">&ldquo;Chris Tomlin Shares The Stories Behind ‘Chris Tomlin and Friends’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.americansongwriter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/31094746/Chris-Tomlin.jpg" alt="img">
World-renowned Christian artist, Chris Tomlin, released his brand-new record titled “Chris Tomlin and Friends,” July 31, 2020. The project brought together multiple artists and merged genres, a feat which Tomlin described to American Songwriter as one of his long-time dreams.</p>
<p>What started as simply a desire to get together and write songs with individuals who Tomlin always hoped to work with, including Thomas Rhett, Lady Antebellum and Florida Georgia Line, the tracks blossomed into a full-length album that Tomlin said is a musical picture of the DNA of everyone involved.</p>
<p>“It’s been a surprise year,” Tomlin said. “It’s been nothing I saw coming, nothing I was trying to do, nothing that was on my radar. So much so that just a little over a year ago I didn’t even know most of the people involved (in the album).”</p>
<p>Many of the artists Tomlin partnered with for the project, he met by chance—backstage at a show in 2019, at a gym while on vacation—the collaborations that amounted to the full album were totally orchestrated by God, according to Tomlin.</p>
<p>But the success of the collaboration came by way of personal relationships, Tomlin said. Rather than oriented by labels or managers, it was simply people who loved Jesus wanting to work together and make music.</p>
<p>“These songs just started coming, so quickly and so easily,” Tomlin said. “It was beautiful to see the smashing up of all our different worlds and what that sounded like—of country and the Christian worship genre coming together. Mixing that DNA up, you have this interesting sound in the music. You hear a lot of my DNA on it, and the more country style on it. It’s really cool.”</p>
<p>The members of Florida Georgia Line actually produced the entire record with him, Tomlin noted. They were in every studio session.</p>
<p>“It feels like a real collaboration. We’ve been in this together,” Tomlin said. “We were all doing this together and so it has a real family feel to it that I think people will sense.”</p>
<p>“It’s definitely a variety of sounds. It’s not like anything I’ve ever done before, by a long shot, and I think the other artists would say the same,” Tomlin continued.</p>
<p>But one of the best parts of working with artists outside the typical Christian genre, was hearing about their heart for ministry and for the Lord, Tomlin said.</p>
<p>“The beautiful thing with this album is the opportunity with this music to break down walls between genres. It’s just great music, and the goal would be for my music to reach an audience it’s never reached before,” Tomlin explained. “All of us doing something that really brings glory to God together, is pretty special.”</p>
<p>Tomlin noted he hopes the friendships created in the process of making this album continue on for future projects and musical collaborations. Being able to include country music influences in a project of his fulfills a desire he’s had for quite some time.</p>
<p>“I’ve been saying since day one I’d love at some point to make some kind of country music record, because I’ve loved that music for so long,” Tomlin explained. “It’s really full circle in my life, so that’s been a real fun thing to see. I think these friendships that have happened with all these new guys, (are) so good and (I’m) so blown away by these guys who are behind the scenes. Their heart for their family, their heart for God and their heart for people is just beautiful to see.”</p>

<h3 id="chris-tomlin-recruits-thomas-rhett-brett-young-and-more-for-new-album">&ldquo;Chris Tomlin Recruits Thomas Rhett, Brett Young and More for New Album&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://cmt.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:cmt.com:694015?width=1200&amp;height=675&amp;.jpg" alt="img">
If you’ve been hoping that the lines between country and contemporary Christian music would blur, your prayers have been answered.</p>
<p>Because Grammy-winning contemporary Christian music singer, songwriter and worship leader Chris Tomlin has a new album due out on Friday (July 31) — called simply, Chris Tomlin: Chris Tomlin &amp; Friends — and oh, what a friend he has in country.</p>
<p>Some of Tomlin’s country collaborators are ones he’s worked with before. He is one of the artists on Thomas Rhett’s uplifting ballad of perfect timing, “Be a Light.” And late last year, he crashed a Florida Georgia Line concert and has stayed closely connected to Tyler Hubbard and Brian Kelley.</p>
<p>The list of who Tomlin sings with and who he wrote with on this project goes on and on and on, and runs deep into the well of country music’s most gifted singers and songwriters. I know this because I had the chance to talk to Tomlin about which country stars he had on each track, and the story behind each one. “There was really never the thought of, ’Let’s make a record together.’ It was more like, ’Man, this friendship started and wouldn’t it be cool to see what would happen if we wrote some songs together,'” Tomlin told me about how the process evolved so naturally. “This album has no rules. And that’s the beautiful thing.”</p>
<p>CMT.com: Let’s go track by track. Tell me first about “Thank You Lord,” with Thomas Rhett and Florida Georgia Line.</p>
<p>Tomlin: This song is so fun. I mean, this is the perfect example to me of collaboration and what this record is about. Because it’s Thomas (Rhett), it’s Tyler (Hubbard), it’s BK (Brian Kelley), and so I think you can hear all the different DNA in the song. To me, it is the ultimate smash-up song because it’s so country with the lyrics, and then we get to the bridge about “praise up, eyes closed, one thing I know” and that definitely feels more like me. I think it just is a combination of all of us together and what the song say is also incredibly powerful, right? To have a life of gratitude and thank God for all things that are around you. I think that’s a big theme in this record. And not only thanking God for all the good things and the sweet things in life, but the hard things as well. The ones that you look back on and go, “Wow, at the time I didn’t really feel very grateful for those things, but now I know how much they teach us and shape us.”</p>
<p>And how about the Lady A collaboration on “Who You Are To Me”?</p>
<p>There’s a great story in that one, too, because things started organically taking shape. And I thought, “Man, we must get more artists involved. Let’s do something so expansive and wide, as wide as we can make it.” I instantly thought of Lady A. I’ve known Hillary (Scott) and Dave (Haywood) for a while, but I didn’t know Charles as well. And I remember walking into Dave’s little writing room just to see what would happen if our worlds collided. It was so special, because when Charles walked into the room, he was just so vulnerable from the start. He was trying to say that this wasn’t in his wheelhouse. But he said, “You know what? When I think about faith and the stories of Sunday school and the Bible stories that you grew up hearing, I think that for the last few years I’ve just really been in a hard place and gone through a lot. And you find that in those hard places, God meets you in a special way. You understand who God is in a special way when it becomes more personal.” And so those first lines, about, “Some people think you’re just some words on a page and you’re nothing more than fables handed down along the way, but I’ve seen you part the waters when no one else can pull me from the deep, and that’s who you are to me.” I think that’s really where a lot of people are. Like, I’ve heard all the stories. I know what the bible says about God, but how has he met me in all these different ways? At the end of the song, it turns into this really high praise. That’s so incredible to me. Hillary said, “I just think at the very end, we should just take it one more level where it’s just high praise to God for who he is.” When we were writing this song together, I remember Charles saying that he hadn’t enjoyed writing a song this much since “Need You Now.” And as you know, when those guys start singing, everything sounds so good. You don’t even know if the song is any good, or if it just sounds good because they’re singing it.</p>
<p>The third track is one with just you and Thomas Rhett. It’s called “God Who Listens.” Which kind of reminds me of one of his first singles “Beer with Jesus” from almost a decade ago. What can you tell me about that one?</p>
<p>This was my first time sitting down with Thomas. We were writing together for his Christmas album last year, and he said, “I’ve got this idea that I’d love for us to think about.” It was me, Thomas, Ashley Gorley and David Garcia. I mean, if you can’t write a good song with those guys, you just need to quit first of all. And then secondly, Thomas just said that he’d heard his pastor say that the difference maker in who we worship is that we are praying to a God who listens. He said that really meant something to him. So immediately that lyric came, “I’m not just hoping, I’m not just wishing. I know I’m praying to God who listens.” We really tried to paint a picture of that: of this grandness, this greatness, this all powerful and untouchable — you would think — God and yet he still draws close to us and still hears what’s in our hearts. That is an incredible thing to contemplate and to think about throughout all of your life. And so I think that’s the heart and core of this song.</p>
<p>I’ve really been turning up the volume on “Be The Moon,” with Brett Young and Cassadee Pope. What was it like to work with them on such a spiritual song?</p>
<p>This one is the core of the record to me. I had this idea that I’d been trying to figure out how to write for years. It’s all about how the moon is such an incredible picture of our faith. And what I mean by that is, the moon is the light in the dark, right? It lights up the night. It is a light in the dark, and yet incredibly, the moon does not have any light on its own. It just reflects a greater light. That is such a beautiful picture of what faith is about, and what the essence of Christianity is to me. To me, it’s that essence of faith in the sense that I don’t have any light of my own, and it doesn’t come from me, but if I get in the right place, I can reflect the light of God. Isn’t it incredible how the moon is not striving to be anything? It’s just floating and it gets in the right place and it reflects light. Sometimes, it’s just a sliver. Sometimes, it’s full moon. Life has been hard in 2020. This year is one for the books, man. There’s so much about life that is unfair, and it comes at us different ways. As we were getting together, the artists, we all kind of talked about the idea of bringing glory to God and being a light in a hurting world. I love the line in the song, “Everybody wants to be somebody. I want to be somebody, too, but if I’m going to be known for something, I want to be known for you, I want to be the moon.” That definitely resonates with me and helps me understand what faith is about.</p>
<p>It was such a pleasant surprise to hear Russell Dickerson’s voice on “Sing,” along with Florida Georgia Line. How did that song come together?</p>
<p>To me, Russell had to be a part of this project when it started happening. Because Russell was my guitar tech for three years over a decade ago. He’s such an incredible guy. He has so much charisma, right? And so we’ve had this great relationship for so many years. It’s been really fun to see him become a superstar. So when we started thinking, “Man, we’ve got something here. We got a lot of great song. Let’s get a lot of like-minded, like-hearted, like-faith guys and see if we can do this together.” And Russell was one of the first calls I made for this.</p>
<p>How did you and RaeLynn end up together for “Chase Me Down”?</p>
<p>Oh my goodness. I felt like we were in the current of the river, right? The river was rolling over and we were just going wherever it took us. And it got to that point where we were just creating this whole project through friendships. There was no A&amp;R, no labels, no managers involved. People didn’t even know we were doing this. It was just us. And I didn’t know RaeLynn, but instantly I knew this song was so special. We were saying we think it’s the best song RaeLynn’s ever written. So I said, “Let’s just let her sing the song, and I’ll just sing harmony.” There’s a lot in the song that just knocks me down every time. And then in the chorus, there’s a part that says, “When I’m lost and I’m low in a place that I think you won’t go, you chase me down.” That is great. That is the gospel. That is the good news, and all of us have felt that. Or maybe thought they were so far away. Or that there’s no way that with all things they’ve done that God could ever hear them or their prayers. And that’s the story that Jesus told the prodigal son, and it is all through the Bible. RaeLynn has such an honest voice, and such a haunting voice, that I can’t imagine another person singing this song.</p>
<p>And then there’s “Gifts From God,” with Chris Lane. I know he is a very spiritual man, but you can’t always tell that from his country songs. What was this collaboration like for you?</p>
<p>This one was the first song we wrote for the record. And I knew that no matter what happened, after we wrote lots of songs that aren’t on this record and edited some out when we were trying to find the best, I knew this one would make it. And I love the very country feeling of the lyrics and the idea. But it’s done in a different way, when you’re just thanking God for those gifts that are the ones money can’t buy. You know, it’s the people that you love next to you, it’s your families, it’s your kids, it’s peace at night, it’s knowing that every day you wake up is a gift from God. And even the things you looked back on and thought, “Man, that was a terrible thing and I didn’t get what I wanted, but it’s actually a gift that didn’t get what I wanted.”</p>
<p>For the songs on Chris Tomlin &amp; Friends, Tomlin teamed up with Nashville singers and songwriters B. Kelley, Hubbard, Dickerson, Thomas Rhett, C. Kelley, Haywood, Scott, RaeLynn, Shay Mooney, Garcia, Gorley, Cary Barlowe, Josh Kerr, Natalie Hemby and Corey Crowder.</p>

<p><img src="https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Chris-Tomlin.jpg" alt="img">
Chris Tomlin is teaming up with Florida Georgia Line, Thomas Rhett, Russell Dickerson, Chris Lane, RaeLynn, Cassadee Pope, Brett Young, Lady A and more for his latest album Chris Tomlin &amp; Friends, and has revealed the track list for the new project.</p>
<p>The project will be available digitally on July 31 and a physical album will be released on Aug. 28. “Who You Are To Me,” featuring Lady A, is out at Christian radio today. The song was co-written by Chris Tomlin, Charles Kelley, Hillary Scott and Dave Haywood, who also co-produced the track.</p>
<p>“This song is about the realization that all the crazy stories in the scripture that you heard growing up, like David &amp; Goliath, are real and that when you are in a place far from God, He comes in and meets you right where you are, and pulls you out of the deep,” said Tomlin. “This song really shows the power of being real and honest, and because it comes from a real place, I think people are going to connect with it.”</p>
<p>“When we got together to write we just shared who God was for us and how he is working from the inside out in our lives,” co-writer/co-producer Dave Haywood said. “We poured all of that into this song and we are grateful to be included in this project.”</p>

Chris Tomlin, a contemporary Christian star and worship leader, has canceled a series of drive-in concerts planned for July 24-26 in Kentucky, Alabama and Georgia.</p>
<p>The shows, part of Tomlin’s Worship Tailgate Tour, included a July 25 appearance at John Hunt Park and Rocket City Fairgrounds, off Airport Road Southwest in Huntsville.</p>
<p>“Due to the current rise in COVID-19 cases both locally and nationally, the Chris Tomlin Worship Tailgate tour date in Huntsville, AL on July 25 has been CANCELLED,” promoter Premier Productions said via Facebook. “The health and safety of all attendees, artists, volunteers and crew are our top priority. Chris Tomlin was looking forward to worshipping live together again and can’t wait for the day when it’s safe to gather once more! Refunds will be automatically credited to your account. If you have any questions, please email <a href="mailto:support@platformtickets.com">support@platformtickets.com</a>.”</p>
<p>Other dates on Tomlin’s Worship Tailgate Tour were set for July 24 at the Kentucky Expo Center in Louisville, Kentucky; and July 26 at The Rock Ranch in The Rock, Georgia. Cancellation announcements for these events were posted on Facebook, as well.</p>
<p>Producers for the tour were Premier Productions and 46 Entertainment, the companies behind Rock the South in Cullman and Alan Jackson’s recent drive-in shows in Cullman and Fairhope.</p>
<p>Tickets for the concerts ranged from $49.50-$175 via Platform Tickets. Singer-songwriter Pat Barrett was on the bill, as well</p>
<p>“It is amazing to see how God moves when we come together to worship as one voice,” Tomlin said in via a statement that was attached to the cancellation announcements. “I was so excited about the Worship Tailgate nights but I am looking forward to a day when we can worship live and in person again. I am continuing to pray for health and safety for your families, friends, and community. While we can’t worship together physically, we can continue to praise God together in our homes.”</p>
<p>Tomlin, 48, is one of the best-known praise and worship artists in the country, with a dozen studio albums and more than 20 Dove Awards to his credit. He has a strong following in Alabama, and has performed here many times in cities such as Birmingham, Huntsville and Mobile.</p>
<p>Tomlin’s next album, “Chris Tomlin &amp; Friends,” features collaborations with country artists and is set for release July 31. Two singles from the project &ndash; “Thank You Lord” featuring Thomas Rhett and Florida Georgia Line, and “Who You Are To Me” featuring Lady A &ndash; were released in advance.
