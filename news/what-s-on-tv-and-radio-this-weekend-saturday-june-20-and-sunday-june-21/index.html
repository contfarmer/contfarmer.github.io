<p>I Am Not Your Negro</p>
<p>BBC Two, 9pm</p>
<p>What would the fiercely articulate writer James Baldwin have made of the world today? Sadly the great man died of stomach cancer aged just 63 in 1987, but this film, made in 2016, shows how his thinking remains powerful, precise, poetic and relevant. Told entirely in Baldwin’s words and using the text (read by Samuel L Jackson) of his final unfinished book project, Remember This House, Raoul Peck’s Oscar-nominated film follows Baldwin’s history of the black experience in America, from ghastly media stereotypes to scenes of police brutality that today feel horribly familiar. Baldwin only completed 30 pages of his final book,

<h3 id="neil-hamilton-disgraced-mp-to-z-list-celebrity-to-political-comeback">&ldquo;Neil Hamilton: disgraced MP to Z-list celebrity to political comeback&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc545ee220a877ad0a4bdc8fb2f43f2e5e9de7d8/0_0_1568_941/1568.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=3a0c6757d3a075c556b7fc689b32919a" alt="img">
The former Tory is unexpectedly back, leading Ukip in the Welsh assembly. Here’s a summary of his career highs and lows</p>
<p>Younger citizens may not have heard of Neil Hamilton, who has made a triumphant return with Ukip to the Welsh assembly after 20 years in the political wilderness.</p>
<p>Not only has he been elected as one of seven Ukip assembly members via the regional list system, he has been appointed “group leader”, beating the head of the party in Wales, Nathan Gill. Gill remains Welsh leader of Ukip because that role is directly appointed by Nigel Farage, the party’s UK chief. This in no way sounds awkward.</p>
<p>Hamilton told ITV Morning Britain he had strong ties with the country. “Cut me open, I’d be like a stick of Blackpool Rock,” he said, momentarily forgetting that Blackpool is not in Wales.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick reminder of some of Hamilton’s career highlights, in case you were lucky enough to have missed them first time round.</p>
<p>He was a Tory whip in the 1980s</p>
<p>Hamilton became MP for Tatton in 1983, after failing to secure Bradford North in 1979. He served as a government whip under Margaret Thatcher, before becoming corporate affairs minister under John Major. Hamilton’s views and policies – anti-Europe, pro-privatisation, anti-trade unions, and pro-smoking – haven’t changed too much since.</p>
<p>He wanted to shut down the coal mines</p>
<p>Hamilton’s roots may have been in coal mining – both his grandfathers were south Wales miners – but he was part of the Thatcher government that went to war with the industry and its unions. “Britain couldn’t continue being an industrial museum for ever,” he explained more recently.</p>
<p>He opposed the removal of lead from petrol</p>
<p>Hamilton wasn’t too impressed at the medical and environmental evidence on unleaded petrol, telling parliament as recently as 1999 there was “no evidence that lead in petrol poses any health risk”.</p>
<p>A liar and a cheat</p>

<p>Hamilton’s political downfall came in 1996, after the Guardian reported he had taken money in brown envelopes from Mohamed Al Fayed in the “cash-for-questions” scandal. His libel suit against the paper collapsed, leading to this infamous headline and his resignation from government. He went on to lose his Tatton seat to journalist Martin Bell in 1997’s general election.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Tatton’s MP is George Osborne, the chancellor.</p>
<p>He was the subject of a Louis Theroux documentary</p>
<p>In 2001, Hamilton was considered weird enough to justify a Louis Theroux documentary, appearing alongside his wife, Christine. The couple used the programme to relaunch themselves as media stars and it’s still compelling viewing, particularly Christine Hamilton’s flirt scene, and Neil’s House of Cards (original version) quoting response. The Hamiltons’ friends in the Tory press weren’t too impressed, but the couple seemed to know what they were doing. While Neil’s political career was in the wilderness, he had a new plan.</p>
<p>He becomes an all-purpose Z-list celebrity</p>

<p>It’s difficult to imagine now, but the Hamiltons became archtypes for a new kind of celebrity: famous for being famous, the initial context of their fame (public scandal and humiliation) seemed forgotten in an endless round of shameless PR appearances.</p>
<p>He danced for Johnny Vegas’s fish</p>
<p>But suckling from the teat of media fame is a game of ever-descreasing circles, and tends to end one way: in a perspex cage being showered with fish while Johnny Vegas shouts: “You sicken me!”</p>
<p>He joins Ukip</p>
<p>After first appearing on a Ukip stage in 2011, eyebrows were raised when Hamilton was given important roles within the party, rising to the role of campaigns director. He was demoted from the role in 2014.</p>

<p>And then gets voted in as the leader of their Welsh assembly group. Happy now?</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png" alt="img">
Nadine Milroy-Sloan, 28, of Grimsby, alleged last May that the Hamiltons had forced her to take part in sex games at a flat in Ilford, east London, owned by Barry Lehaney, 61, a retired financial adviser.</p>
<p>The Hamiltons were arrested in August but no charges were levelled. Mr Lehaney was also cleared.</p>
<p>Mr Hamilton was forced to resign from the goverment in 1994 after the Guardian revealed that he had accepted cash in exchange for asking parliamentary questions.</p>
<p>Ms Milroy-Sloan was formally charged that &ldquo;on or before May 6 2001 &hellip; with intent to pervert the course of public justice, you did an act or series of acts which had a tendency to pervert the course of public justice in that you falsely alleged rape and serious sexual assault leading to the arrest of Barry Lehaney, Neil Hamilton and Christine Hamilton which is contrary to common law&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Hamiltons are pursuing a libel action against Ms Milroy-Sloan, whose assets were frozen by the high court. She has since declared herself bankrupt.</p>
<p>Both sides in the saga sold their stories while the police investigation was continuing, with the Hamiltons making public the lurid allegations against them on the steps of the police station.</p>
<p>Mrs Hamilton said the allegations and investigation had left her &ldquo;traumatised mentally and physically&rdquo;, and described the decision to investigate as an outrage.</p>
<p>The Hamiltons maintained that they had been drinking in Claridges when they were alleged to have been attacking the woman.

<p>Christine Hamilton has been removed as a charity ambassador after comparing burkas to the hoods of the Ku Klux Klan.</p>
<p>The broadcaster and wife of UKIP Welsh Assembly member Neil Hamilton sparked outrage on Twitter with her comments.</p>
<p>Muscular Dystrophy UK said it opposed &ldquo;prejudice and discrimination&rdquo; and had severed all links with Mrs Hamilton.</p>
<p>But she said the tweet was not intended to equate Muslim women with the violent white supremacist organisation.</p>
<p>Mrs Hamilton, who styles herself as the &ldquo;British Battleaxe&rdquo;, posted an image of members of the KKK in their hoods on Friday.</p>
<p>Responding to the row over Boris Johnson&rsquo;s recent remarks in a newspaper article, she asked: &ldquo;If the #burka is acceptable then presumably this is too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hours later, in response to a backlash on social media, she said the tweet had been misunderstood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake - no, I am not comparing Muslim women to KKK members and yes, thank you, I do know the difference,&rdquo; she tweeted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was graphically illustrating how full facial cover can be sinister, which is how many people view the burka.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her original tweet received thousands of comments, mostly criticising her comparison of religious expression with one of racist intimidation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The burka is not a symbol of hatred,&rdquo; wrote one Twitter user.</p>
<p>Muscular Dystophy UK, a charity she has represented since 2013, ended their relationship with the media personality on Saturday night.</p>
<p>A spokesman said her comments were made in a personal capacity and do not &ldquo;in any way&rdquo; represent the charity&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe in a diverse and inclusive society, respect for all and we oppose all forms of prejudice and discrimination,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Chief executive Robert Meadowcroft said that the decision to end her role &ldquo;fully reflects the values of the charity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In a further tweet, Mrs Hamilton acknowledged she had &ldquo;offended people&rdquo;. She said she had removed all reference in her Twitter profile to the charities she supported &ldquo;to avoid any embarrassment&rdquo;.

<h3 id="hamiltons-toast-end-of-pr-king-max-cliffords-reign-with-champagne">&ldquo;Hamiltons toast end of PR king Max Clifford&rsquo;s reign with champagne&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2014/5/3/1399134565421/Neil-and-Christine-Hamilt-011.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=f24aa155d1739ce9848519bb729988e1" alt="img">
Christine Hamilton, who together with her husband successfully sued Max Clifford for defamation, has admitted that the couple toasted the publicist&rsquo;s downfall with champagne, as Scotland Yard confirmed that it was looking into further allegations against him.</p>
<p>The wife of former Tory minister Neil Hamilton said she did not feel delight over the saga because of the suffering of Clifford&rsquo;s victims, but added: &ldquo;I just think, &lsquo;yes, he&rsquo;s gone. Goodbye Max&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of another person whom I would describe this way, but he is wicked. My husband would possibly put it in stronger words. He might agree with David Mellor, who said, &lsquo;May he rot in hell&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clifford was sentenced to eight years in prison last Friday for sexually abusing four teenage women. Scotland Yard said on Saturday that other people had now come forward with allegations against Clifford, and that &ldquo;this is currently subject to review&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The 71-year-old was sued by the Hamiltons in 2002, over his role in promoting on television a false claim of rape against the couple.</p>
<p>The publicist paid out undisclosed damages, and £500,000 in legal costs, after the Hamiltons&rsquo; alleged victim, Nadine Milroy-Sloan, whose story he helped sell to the News of the World for £50,000, was jailed for three years for seeking to pervert the course of justice.</p>
<p>Hamilton said: &ldquo;Clifford steamrolled the story forward. We were arrested in the most public way. We went to Barkingside station and, by the time we came out, the entire world was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was horrendous. We had been interrogated separately by the police and at the end of both of our interviews we were asked, does the name Max Clifford mean anything to you? That was when we said, &lsquo;We knew it&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sued him because of things he said on live television.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hamilton said she believed that &ldquo;almost the worst thing Clifford did at the time&rdquo; was to sell the story to the News of the World, during which Milroy-Sloan&rsquo;s anonymity was voluntarily lifted. &ldquo;Every time someone cries wolf it makes it that bit harder for genuine victims to be believed.&rdquo; &ldquo;That was his worst crime – against genuine victims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added: &ldquo;When I came down [to the kitchen] this morning, I saw an empty bottle of champagne with &lsquo;Clifford&rsquo; scrawled all over the label. Whenever we open a bottle of champagne for a specific reason, we put a label on it and it joins the stack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clifford, who was also behind a fabricated News of the World front-page story claiming that former Tory minister David Mellor wore a Chelsea shirt while having sex with his mistress, was convicted last week of eight counts of abuse, carried out between 1977 and 1984.</p>
<p>Judge Anthony Leonard imposed a sentence almost double what had been expected. He made reference in his sentencing to Clifford&rsquo;s attitude during the trial at Southwark crown court: the defendant had laughed when hearing testimony from those making accusations against him.</p>
<p>Hamilton said: &ldquo;I am sure he was massively motivated by money during his grubby little career but it was also about power – and for a long time he was a very powerful man.&rdquo;

<p><img src="http://preview.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02089/hamilton_2089033a.jpg" alt="img">
Neil Hamilton has withdrawn his attempt to stand as an MP for Ukip as it emerged he was facing questions over expenses claims he made as deputy chairman of the party.</p>
<p>The former Conservative MP withdrew from the selection process to become the prospective parliamentary candidate for Nigel Farage’s party in the Essex last night.</p>
<p>It came as it was revealed that Mr Hamilton is under scrutiny from the Ukip finance committee over expenses he allegedly claimed for staying at his wife Christine&rsquo;s London flat.</p>
<p>Details of the expenses claims emerged in a leaked letter just hours before Mr Hamilton told party members at a hustings meeting for the Basilon and East Thurrock seat in Pitsea that he would not be standing for election there.</p>
<p>He had been one of five candidates in the running to become Ukip&rsquo;s candidate for the seat of South Basildon and East Thurrock.</p>
<p>He said he supported another candidate, Kerry Smith, who was later selected.</p>
<p>Before the meeting letter from Ukip Finance committee was sent to the former MP asking him to explain &ldquo;each and ever mileage claim&rdquo; he has made and &ldquo;an explanation of each stat that has been charged for your wife&rsquo;s flat&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The letter, which was published in full by Channel Four news, reflects deep concerns in the ranks of Ukip&rsquo;s leadership about Mr Hamilton&rsquo;s role in the party.</p>
<p>Mr Hamilton dismissed the letter was simply a &ldquo;dirty trick&rdquo; intended to destablise the hustings and said he had already provided answers to some of the concerns.</p>
<p>Announcing his decision to step aside Mr Hamilton told the BBC: “He [Karry Smith, another Ukip candidate] should never have been deselected in the first place, in my opinion, and he will make an excellent member of parliament for Basildon.”</p>
<p>“I would not have put my hat into the ring if I&rsquo;d known that Kerry was going to be a candidate.</p>
<p>“I didn&rsquo;t know until I got here that his name was included in the ballot paper.”</p>
<p>His effort to return to Parliament for Ukip was a personal battle for Mr Hamilton who was drummed out of the House of Commons in 1997 after 14 years as an MP when he lost the safe Tory Tatton seat after the cash for questions scandal.</p>
<p>Mr Hamilton was left with a reported £2million legal bill after he failed to overturn a libel defeat against Mohamed Fayed which had claimed Mr Hamilton accepted money to table Parliamentary Questions.</p>
<p>Mr Hamilton and his wife Christine always denied wrong doing. In her 2005 autobiography “For Better for Worse” Mrs Hamilton disclosed that the Inland Revenue had examined Mr Hamilton’s accounts after the Fayed case and concluded “that Fayed had not paid Neil cash for questions”.</p>
<p>Mr Hamilton joined Ukip in 2002.

<h3 id="christine-hamilton-warned-beware-the-spy-in-camp-ahead-of-kerry-smith-resignation">&ldquo;Christine Hamilton warned ‘beware the spy in camp’ ahead of Kerry Smith resignation&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://preview.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02089/hamilton_2089033a.jpg" alt="img">
Christine Hamilton sent out a “cryptic” message warning of a “spy in the camp” hours before the man who replaced her husband as Ukip’s candidate in a key seat was forced to stand down over a bigoted rant.</p>
<p>The panto star also tweeted “he who laughs last laughs longest” two days before extracts of a tape recorded phone call in which Kerry Smith made derogatory references to Chinese people, homosexuals and the poor were leaked to a national newspaper.</p>
<p>Mr Smith said that the remarks were made two years ago while he was under the influence of strong painkillers, but was forced to resign as the candidate for Ukip’s top target seat of South Basildon and East Thurrock.</p>
<p>His departure followed that of Mr Hamilton, the former Conservative MP and Ukip’s deputy chairman, who himself stood aside as a candidate for the seat after being questioned about expense claims he had allegedly made for staying at a flat owned by his wife.</p>
<p>When he stood aside, Mr Hamilton said he was a supporter of Mr Smith and looked forward to him becoming an MP.</p>
<p>But his wife has since used her Twitter account to criticise Mr Smith, after extracts of the call in which he referred to a Chinese woman as a “Chinky bird,” described a shooting party in Chigwell as a “peasant hunt” and mocked gay party members appeared in the Mail on Sunday.</p>
<p>She said: “If someone rants racist &amp; homophobic remarks when on sedatives what on earth do they do when firing on all cylinders. #JustAsking.”</p>
<p>Asked by The Telegraph if she was linked to the leak, Mrs Hamilton refused to comment.</p>
<p>Two days after her husband’s resignation, and two days before the story emerged, she tweeted: “He who laughs last laughs longest …”</p>
<p>This was followed by the Tweet: “Beware the spy in the camp….”</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter: Christine Hamilton - Beware the spy in the camp….<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>When asked by followers to explain the remarks, she replied: “Cryptic Friday?… &raquo;Not at all … those who need to know will know.”</p>
<p>Mrs Hamilton and her husband have denied any wrongdoing over his expenses.
