<p>Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell share glimpse inside home in fun family video The First Wives Club star has been dating Kurt Russell for 37 years</p>
<p>Goldie Hawn has been having the best time during lockdown – and she has the video to prove it! The First Wives Club star recently shared fun footage on Instagram of herself dancing around the kitchen to OutKast&rsquo;s Hey Ya! at her family home in LA, all while washing the dishes. The Hollywood star was joined by partner Kurt Russell and his son Boston, as well as the family&rsquo;s beloved pet dog. &ldquo;Washing dishes doesn&rsquo;t have to be a chore, it can be a dance!&rdquo; she wrote alongside the clip. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all up to us.&rdquo; The video also gave fans an incredible glimpse inside the star&rsquo;s stunning open-plan kitchen, filled with artwork and a marble-topped island.</p>

<p>This isn’t the first time Goldie has shared a look inside her beautiful home. During lockdown, the star has posted videos from her spacious living room, as well as her workout room – where she has been keeping fit on a miniature trampoline and exercise bike.</p>
<p>The actress has also been pictured in her large garden, which is filled with quirky decorations, including a giant cow, which she was seen sitting on in one of her recent social media images.</p>

<p>Now that the lockdown restrictions have been eased, Goldie and Kurt have been able to see their family again. As well as having Boston over to visit, they have also spent time with Kate Hudson and her children.</p>
<p>Doting grandmother Goldie was pictured with her oldest grandchild Ryder last month while in the garden, and fans couldn&rsquo;t believe just how much they looked alike.</p>

<p>The Overboard star is a doting grandmother to six grandchildren in total and loves nothing more than spending time with her family. The actress previously told Australian Women&rsquo;s Weekly: &ldquo;A good family is the answer to happiness. I look at our kids and grandchildren and there&rsquo;s nothing in the world that could make me as proud as I am of all of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goldie often shares glimpses inside her family home and garden</p>
<p>Goldie and Kurt have been together since Valentine&rsquo;s Day 1983, and celebrated 37 years together in February. The celebrity couple are often asked about marriage, and Goldie previously revealed their reasons for not tying the knot.</p>
<p>Speaking on Loose Women in 2015, the actress said: &ldquo;I would have been long divorced if I’d been married. Marriage is an interesting psychological thing. If you need to feel bound to someone, then it&rsquo;s important to be married.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have independence, if you have enough money and sense of independence and you like your independence, there’s something psychological about not being married because it gives you the freedom to make decisions one way or the other. For me, I chose to stay. Kurt chose to stay, and we like the choice.&rdquo;</p>

Goldie Hawn still has moves.</p>
<p>The 74-year-old star has become known for sharing fun dancing videos on Instagram, previously taking on Dua Lipa&rsquo;s &ldquo;Physical,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sing A Song&rdquo; by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and more.</p>
<p>Now, the &ldquo;Overboard&rdquo; star is marching to the beat of a new tune: The Outkast classic &ldquo;Hey Ya!&rdquo;</p>
<p>GOLDIE HAWN RECALLS CONFRONTING HARVEY WEINSTEIN OVER SCRAPPED &lsquo;CHICAGO&rsquo; MOVIE ROLE: &lsquo;I DIDN&rsquo;T BACK DOWN&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the video, the song plays as Hawn washes dishes in her kitchen, gleefully scrubbing away before prancing around with a plate in hand.</p>
<p>Boston, son of Hawn&rsquo;s longtime partner Kurt Russell, also makes an appearance in the video, dancing alongside the actress. Eventually, Russell himself makes a brief cameo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Washing dishes doesn’t have to be a chore, it can be a dance!&rdquo; read the caption. &ldquo;It’s all up to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>GOLDIE HAWN GUSHES ABOUT &lsquo;ANGEL&rsquo; KURT RUSSELL ON FATHER&rsquo;S DAY: &lsquo;NOBODY LOVES LIKE HIM&rsquo;</p>
<p>The dance earned plenty of praise from some of Hawn&rsquo;s famous friends in the comments.</p>
<p>Hawn&rsquo;s daughter, actress Kate Hudson, shared three red heart emojis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love this,&rdquo; wrote Jane Seymour.</p>
<p>Lisa Rinna offered a handful of emojis including hearts and clapping hands.</p>
<p>Diane Keaton simply commented with a laughing face emoji.</p>

<p><img src="https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/goldie-hawn-then-vs-now-mega-ftr.jpg" alt="img">
Goldie Hawn has kept audiences entertained for over five decades now and the 74-year-old shows no signs at stopping anytime soon!</p>
<p>We just love, love, LOVE Goldie Hawn! The Hollywood icon has done an incredible job at staying super relevant throughout the years as her career continues to blossom. She became a huge star in her early 20’s thanks to her memorable appearances on the television classic Rowan &amp; Martin’s Laugh In before successfully transitioning into the world of films. Goldie was then able to snag an Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for her work in Cactus Flower, further cementing her permanent place in the entertainment world.</p>
<p>Things kept getting better and better for her in the years to come. Goldie starred in other major motion picture classics including Private Benjamin (for which she received her 2nd Oscar nomination), and Overboard, which costarred her longtime partner Kurt Russell, 69. The two have been an item for almost forty years now but have yet to make it down the aisle!</p>
<p>Something that fans definitely took note of was how incredible she looked as she got older. She poked fun at it when she played an actress dealing with ageism in Hollywood in the 1996 film The First Wives Club alongside fellow funny ladies and stunning gals Bette Midler, 74, and Diane Keaton, 74.</p>
<p>Goldie, no matter what, always excelled in the fashion department. The bubbly blonde has managed to steal attention in whatever she’s wearing whether it be a sizzling dress at a major awards show or something comfy casual while she’s out and about. Her lookalike daughter Kate Hudson, 41, has no doubt taken on her mom’s unique sense of style along the way.</p>
<p>Goldie nearly broke the internet in August 2020 when she posted an amazing video of her busting a move to the Outkast smash hit “Hey Ya!” She shook her behind in just a black top and workout pants while doing the dishes, leaving fans in total hysterics.</p>
<p>But wait… there’s so much more! Be sure to click on the gallery above for more stunning photos of Goldie.

Leave it to Goldie Hawn to remind us all to stay positive in the most hilarious fashion. On Friday night, the 74-year-old – a staunch advocate of making the best of whatever life throws at you – delivered a lesson in how to make housework fun. In a new Instagram video, the First Wives Club star throws shapes beside her kitchen sink as OutKast’s “Hey Ya!” plays at top volume in the background – turning a sponge and dirty plates into props for a full-blown cardio dance routine. “Washing dishes doesn’t have to be a chore, it can be a dance!” she wrote alongside the clip. “It’s all up to us.”</p>

<p>Joining Hawn to shake it like a Polaroid picture? Her husband of 37 years, Kurt Russell; Russell’s 40-year-old son Boston; and the family’s Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, who looks predictably bemused by all of the commotion. Hawn is dressed casually in workout gear in the video – likely fresh from a session on her beloved mini trampoline in her home-gym or doing yoga in her LA garden.</p>

<p>Hawn’s commitment to mindfulness famously runs deep. When she’s not twirling around her kitchen island with a lemon-print platter, the meditation enthusiast devotes herself to working on MindUp – a nonprofit she founded in 2003 to help children battling with stress and anxiety. Based on neuroscience-based research, its programmes incorporate well-established Cognitive Behavioural Therapy techniques. (No woo-woo crystal healing here.) Among the simple, free resources it provides to help boost our moods? Grounding sensory exercises and a Laughter Challenge approved by Reese Witherspoon.</p>

<p>Goldie&rsquo;s son Oliver and his wife Errin also have three children – sons Wilder and Bodhi, and daughter Rio. &ldquo;Being a grandmother is amazing, I love it. It brings incredible joy. Family is so important,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Goldie and Kurt have been together since Valentine&rsquo;s Day 1983, and celebrated 37 years together in February. The celebrity couple are often asked about marriage, and Goldie previously revealed their reasons for not tying the knot.</p>
<p>Speaking on Loose Women in 2015, the actress said: &ldquo;I would have been long divorced if I’d been married. Marriage is an interesting psychological thing. If you need to feel bound to someone, then it&rsquo;s important to be married.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have independence, if you have enough money and sense of independence and you like your independence, there’s something psychological about not being married because it gives you the freedom to make decisions one way or the other. For me, I chose to stay. Kurt chose to stay, and we like the choice.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/goldie-hawns-cutest-photos-with-kids-kate-oliver-wyatt-and-boston.jpg?crop=3px%2C72px%2C3194px%2C1678px&amp;resize=1200%2C630" alt="img">
Goldie Hawn has shared a ton of memories with her kids over the years. Whether she brought her children to red carpet events or on lavish family vacations, the Overboard alum’s sweetest family photos prove she’s so proud of Oliver Hudson, Kate Hudson and Wyatt Russell.</p>
<p>The iconic actress became a mom for the first time when she welcomed her eldest son, Oliver, in September 1976. Goldie — who was married to ex-husband Bill Hudson at the time – expanded her brood when Kate came along in April 1979. Following her daughter’s birth, the former pair called it quits in 1982.</p>
<p>After Goldie divorced the father of her children, she moved on with actor Kurt Russell. The two crossed paths in 1983 and although they never got married, the longtime partners became the proud parents of their only child together, Wyatt, in July 1986. Through her relationship with the Escape from New York star, Goldie became the loving stepmom of his son, Boston Russell, whom Kurt shares with ex-wife Season Hubley.</p>
<p>As a mom, Goldie takes her role extremely seriously. “You’re creating one, two, three new people. You have a tremendous influence on these human beings,” she explained to Today in 2015. “And these are people that you want, and hopefully will contribute in some way, and put some of the love back in the earth.”</p>
<p>“This is what we do,” she continued during her appearance. “This is what our job is as mothers. We create a good little soul and he or she will pass that on to his or her friends and make an influence. And that’s one way we can help make this world a better place.”</p>
<p>Now that Goldie’s kids are older, she’s making sure to be just as amazing in her role as a grandma to Kate’s brood, Ryder, Bingham and Rani Rose, as well as Oliver’s children, Wilder, Bodhi and Rio. As she praised her kiddos’ skills, Goldie called Kate and Oliver “unbelievable parents.”</p>
<p>“Kurt and I are so proud,” she marveled on Today. “They’re mirroring a lot of the way they were raised, and that just shows you how important it is to raise your kids well, ’cause they will raise their kids well.”</p>
