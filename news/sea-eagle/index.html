<p>&ldquo;Last week was deflating, but to do it again and get the result is really satisfying,&rsquo;&rsquo; Cherry-Evans said. &ldquo;The big lessons we need to learn is how we play our first half of footy. It&rsquo;s chalk and cheese compared to the second half two weeks in a row now. &ldquo;We need to be better starting. And having a ten-day turnaround [until Canberra] is a good time to address a few things. Loading Replay Replay video Play video Play video Cherry-Evans had the chance to put Manly in front with seven minutes remaining, but shanked it from 12m out.</p>
<p>But the Sea Eagles were given a contentious penalty a couple of minutes later and took the two gift points on offer. Had they not blown a ridiculous captain&rsquo;s challenge a few minutes earlier, the Broncos had good grounds to dispute whether Patrick Carrigan had illegally stripped Jake Trbojevic. Tom Trbojevic denies Xavier Coates late in the game. Credit:AAP Brisbane coach Anthony Seibold certainly did not think it was a penalty. &ldquo;It was a really tough call - it was a one-on-one strip,&rsquo;&rsquo; Seibold said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he had called &lsquo;held&rsquo; what normally happens is the guy gets to play the ball again. To lose the game like that is disappointing. I just didn’t think it was a penalty.&rsquo;&rsquo; Taupau lasted eight minutes, clutching at his thumb as he left the field. It was later confirmed he had suffered a compound fracture. Coach Des Hasler said Taupau was looking at up to a fortnight on the sidelines, while Suli would undergo X-rays for a suspected broken finger. At least the Sea Eagles can rest easy knowing they still have Fonua-Blake in the middle It was an eventful night for Manly&rsquo;s debutant winger Tevita Funa, who was terrorised early by the Broncos and in particular opposite winger Xavier Coates. On several occasions Coates came down with the high ball, setting up Kotoni Staggs&rsquo; first try and then scoring the second himself. Coates was exciting the commentators with his athleticism and Brad Fittler even went as far to describe him as a &lsquo;&ldquo;Greg Inglis clone&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old Funa was brought in to replace the injured Jorge Taufua, and could hold his head high at the end of the night. He was seen stretching his calves as he cramped with 20 minutes left on the clock. The kid could require round-the-clock massage until Tuesday. The famous Eagle Rock blared out of Central Coast Stadium at full=time as the lucky fans allowed into the venue for the first time made their share of noise. Brisbane have now lost three on the bounce to genuine premiership threats Parramatta, the Sydney Roosters and Manly. At least this was not a 59-0 blowout. &ldquo;It was a step in the right direction,&rsquo;&rsquo; Seibold said. Marty Taupau lasted eight minutes before dislocating his thumb. Credit:AAP</p>
<p>Things will not improve when they return to the Central Coast next Thursday to take on another heavyweight in Newcastle. Manly hope to welcome the return of Curtis Sironen who was sidelined with a knee injury. The loss of Taupau will hurt the Sea Eagles up front, but as long as Cherry-Evans, Fonua-Blake and the Trbojevic brothers remain fit, they will be in the hunt with any opposition. Trbojevic threw a lovely cut-out pass for Funa for Manly&rsquo;s only try in the first half. He then hung back in attack and drew Staggs out of the defensive line, in turn creating a yawning gap for Cherry-Evans to start the second-half fightback. Suli could not believe his eyes when he found himself on the end of a two-man overlap to score.

<p><img src="https://yachtharbour.com/static/images/n/large_3903_f1fb4.jpg" alt="img">
Sea Eagle II returns from testing her sail handling systems on the North Sea.</p>
<p>With all Covid-19 restrictions during “intelligent lock-down” in the Netherlands Royal Huisman continues working in these extraordinary times under strict regulations. For example, holding social distancing during trails by crew and Project 400 team members; health checks and statements; dedicated working areas; “onboard traffic” directions and “no go” areas.</p>
<p>The 81-metre schooner Sea Eagle II built by Dutch shipyard Royal Huisman and it is the largest superyacht to date and the world’s largest all-aluminium sailing vessel.</p>
<p>The superyacht came from the drawing boards of designer Mark Whiteley, with naval architecture by Dykstra Naval Architects.</p>
<p>The exteriors of Sea Eagle II incorporate the owner’s requirements for world cruising, fast yet comfortable and iconic look. The distinguishing superstructure features a half-raised bridge for inside steering. The yacht’s flybridge offers full controls during sailing, comfortable seating for guests wishing to be close up with the yacht’s navigation, and opportunity for sunbathing. The sheltered main cockpit beneath the flybridge features a bar, sofas and a large table.</p>
<p>A variety of innovative features enhance the yacht’s appeal. The newly developed sliding Rondal door with individually operated moving glass panels provides a seamless transition from the cockpit into the interior, whereas the flybridge steering stations give access to the hydraulically operated crow’s nest for an exhilarating ride up the main mast with breathtaking views.</p>

<h3 id="sea-eagle-attacks-muted-by-a-good-spring">&ldquo;Sea eagle attacks muted by a good spring&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thescottishfarmer.co.uk/resources/images/11400288/" alt="img">
REPORTS OF sea eagle attacks on lambs have been far and few between this lambing season, which some have suggested could be due to a good spring, more foot-fall on the hills and a growing abundance of prey for the species to eat.</p>
<p>However, there are still parts of Scotland which remain vulnerable to attacks, where other sources of prey have not benefitted from this past season.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard farmers say it has been the best lambing year ever and often when it’s a good year for lambing then it’s a better year for everything else,” said Rae McKenzie of Scottish Natural Heritage’s sea eagle management scheme. “If people are happy with lambing, then they might cope with a few losses of lambs which could otherwise finish them off during a bad year. This has also been a good year for birds and small mammals, which could mean there is more prey for sea eagles to choose from.”</p>
<p>Ms McKenzie stressed that despite lockdown putting an end to physical visits, SNH had moved to support farmers virtually and urged people to get in touch with any concerns.</p>
<p>“We have had to suspend all on-site visits, but call-off contractors are set up to offer advice and information to farmers and crofters over the phone, which we know isn’t perfect, but we want people to know our scheme is operating as normal as we can make it within current restrictions.”</p>
<p>Donald and Morag MacCorquodale from North Connell, Oban, have seen little action from their pair of sea eagles this season since their nest was moved earlier in the year. In 2018, they lost a lamb a day in the month of May alone.</p>
<p>“We have had one lamb killed since we turned the sheep out but other than that, it has been fairly quiet,” said Mr MacCorquodale. “Since their nest was taken down, the birds moved east round the plantation and although this measure helped us, it has not solved the problem as they are causing upset on a neighbouring farm.</p>
<p>“We have been seeing the birds in the air a lot more so we’re hoping this means they don’t have a chick. Normally one bird would stand guard in the nest in the early days and it would require a lot more feeding,” he explained.</p>
<p>“With the kids being home for lockdown, we have more activity on the hill, which might have helped deter the birds.”</p>
<p>By contrast, the chair of the North Raasay sheep stock club John Gillies told The SF that this spring hasn’t seen an abundance of new prey for sea eagles on the island, but that the closure of tourism to Raasay has meant less people are feeding the birds, allowing them to devote their full attention to hunting lambs. Taking measures into his own hands, Mr Gillies has started trialling new ways to deter the birds away from his stock.</p>
<p>“When lambing started at the end of April, we were finding a couple of lambs dead a day, with holes in their rib cages and talon marks in their flesh. It has eased off since then as we are out on the hill a lot and we won’t really know the true impact until we start gathering off the hills in early June.</p>
<p>“There is no prey for these birds to eat, so we have started this season taking fallen stock on to the hill where the birds are most active to see if they will take the carcasses over the live lambs. It isn’t a solution as we don’t have a lot of dead sheep to do this with, but the birds are taking them,” he said.</p>
<p>“When we had the boats coming in from Skye, the tour guides would chuck fish out for the sea eagles and they would swoop down and take them. These birds have to kill something to survive and the tourism season has disappeared so it leaves them with limited options.”

<h3 id="nrl-resolute-parramatta-eels-hold-to-beat-manly-sea-eagle-in-controversial-finish">&ldquo;NRL Resolute Parramatta Eels hold to beat Manly Sea Eagle in controversial finish&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2020%2F0606%2Fr705787_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg" alt="img">
The Sea Eagles drove out to Parramatta to take on the table-topping Eels, hoping to provide them with a true test of their much-hyped premiership credentials. Manly gave the home team a costly 16-point head start before winding them in and were desperately unlucky to go down 19-16, with a last-minute try ruled to contain a marginal forward pass.</p>
<p>It was also a test of whether home ground advantage means much in a stadium devoid of fans. This game would have seen a packed house at Bankwest Stadium and 30,000 fervent Eels fans are known to put more pressure on opponents and officials than any other group in the NRL. The five thousand cardboard fans, including a white budgie, were mostly silent with no &ldquo;get &lsquo;em onside&rdquo; calls or &ldquo;Parra, Parra, Parra&rdquo; chants.</p>
<p>The opening exchanges saw plenty of hard running up the middle as Eels Props Junior Paulo and Reagan Campbell-Gillard took on Sea Eagles big guns Martin Taupau and Addin Fonua-Blake. Both teams were playing it cautiously, but still managed to make enough handling errors to frustrate both coaches. Campbell-Gillard in particular was having issues with his hands.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until 15 minutes into the game, following back-to-back attacking raids, that the first points were scored with the Eels taking advantage of a penalty right in front to take a 2-0 lead. Five minutes later the Sea Eagles were afforded the same opportunity and levelled the game up again.</p>

<p>The Sea Eagles had one of the better scoring chances, 15 minutes before the break, as Tom Trbojevic put a charging Curtis Sironen through a gap ten metres out. He was met by a try-saving head on shot from Eels fullback Clint Gutherson.</p>
<p>With the Sea Eagles on the attack, Daly Cherry-Evans put a kick through which rebounded off the foot of Mitchell Moses. Moses was well clear of the pursuing Sea Eagles defenders, but instead of soccering it further downfield he attempted to dive on it and knocked it on. The Sea Eagles were on the attack again, but the Eels defence held them out again.</p>
<p>The next time the Eels were down the attacking end of the field a slick backline movement saw Gutherson cut Michael Jennings out to find Maika Sivo. Tom Trbojevic stopped him in cover, but he was able to shuffle the ball back inside to Jennings who somehow managed to catch it against his hip before diving over out wide. Moses kicked the conversion off the right upright to take the Eels to a 8-2 lead.</p>
<p>The Sea Eagles were having enough chances at the Eels line, but were being frustrated by the Eels defence and several of their attacking raids ended in handovers. With a six again call two minutes from halftime the Sea Eagles looked to be heading for the Eels line, but Tom Trbojevic tried to force a pass around the back of a defender and the ball was handed over to the Eels to give them the last shot of the half.</p>
<p>Jorge Taufua of the Sea Eagles scored two tries on the evening. Cameron Spencer/Getty Images</p>
<p>The Sea Eagles knocked on from the Eels&rsquo; last-tackle kick and from the ensuing scrum Jennings passed it to Sivo who had Dylan Brown lurking outside. He managed a one-handed pass and Brown was over in the corner as the siren sounded. Moses missed the conversion, but the Eels went to the sheds happy with a 12-2 lead.</p>
<p>The second half started with a Sea Eagles&rsquo; handling error, and with the possession, the Eels crossed for their third try of the night with Kane Evans spinning out of a tackle to crash over next to the posts. There was some doubt over the grounding, but the bunker sided with the referee and the converted try took the Eels out to 18-2 lead.</p>
<p>The Sea Eagles were in danger of losing touch, but an Eels error on their next possession gave the visitors a chance for their first try. The ball was spread from the scrum and Tom Trbojevic passed the ball to Jorge Taufua who slammed it down after tumbling over the line. The referee sent the review to the bunker as a &ldquo;no try&rdquo; thinking he had bounced the ball, but slow motion replays showed that he had done enough to get the four points. The conversion attempt faded away, but the Sea Eagles were now just 12 points behind.</p>
<p>Both sides exchanged sets until in the 13th minute of the second half Dylan Walker showed some individual strength, dummying and stepping off his left foot before reaching out in the tackle while on his knees to dot the ball down. Reuben Garrick converted from almost in front and it was game on with the score 18-12 in favour of the Eels.</p>
<p>Four minutes later the Sea Eagles chased hard on a clearing kick. Gutherson gathered the ball and threw a thirty metre pass infield to Blake Ferguson. He managed to scoop it up and face a wall of maroon and white jerseys, but fumbled in the tackle, putting the Sea Eagles on the attack again. The Eels defence held as the Manly attack broke down out wide.</p>
<p>With twenty minutes remaining Sivo took a high kick on his own 20 metre line. He took off down a narrow sideline gap before slipping the ball to Jennings, who weaved and stepped his way well into Manly territory. On the last tackle Eels hooker Reed Mahoney put a kick through from dummy half and Oregon Kaufusi was first to the bouncing ball, but was ruled to have fumbled the grounding. Another Eels try at this stage of the game would surely have pulled the curtains closed on the Sea Eagles fightback.</p>
<p>The big hits continued as this fast-paced, high quality game headed towards fulltime. There was plenty of feeling in defence and both teams scrambled desperately to end dangerous looking plays.</p>
<p>A handy penalty on their 20 metre line saw the Sea Eagles launch another attack on the Eels line, but the defence was rock-solid, Manly finishing the set once again without a kick.</p>
<p>With nine minutes to go a bust by Joel Thompson saw the Sea Eagles on the attack again, but a poor last tackle kick from Cherry-Evans ended the raid and the Eels worked their way back down the other end of the field. With a six again call, Moses took the advantage from right in front to take the Eels to a seven-point lead. His field goal taking the score to 19-12 with time rapidly expiring.</p>
<p>The Sea Eagles tried a short kick off and Eels centre Waqa Blake was ruled to have knocked the ball on. The field goal was looking like a very good idea as the Sea Eagles peppered the Eels line. That set ended in yet another terrible last tackle option, with Cherry-Evans dribbling a kick straight into the Eels defender&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>Next time down there though, the Sea Eagles ran the ball on the last tackle and slick passing saw Taufua beat three defenders to ground the ball in the corner. There was just over 3 minutes remaining as Garrick missed the conversion, leaving Manly trailing 19-16.</p>
<p>Jorge Taufua of the Sea Eagles scored two tries on the evening. Cameron Spencer/Getty Images</p>
<p>From the kick-off the Sea Eagles spread the ball right then left where Ferguson knocked down a looping Tom Trbojevic pass. It came down to a final set of six for the Sea Eagles and they were positioned well enough to take the lead. They passed the ball to the right and a Tom Trbojevic pass was controversially ruled forward as Garrick crashed over in the corner for what would have been the winning try.</p>
<p>Replays showed the ball drifting forward as Trbojevic was slammed backwards in a tackle. He appeared to have passed the ball backwards from his hands, but the 20 metre line made for compelling visual evidence of where the balls started and finished. Technically the pass was probably fine, but it was a call that could have gone either way.</p>
<p>The final siren sounded and the Eels celebrated a 4-0 start to the season. It was a great test of their resolve and they will no doubt gain a lot of confidence from the win. These two teams will both be playing finals football this year and another meeting would provide a further chapter in this great rivalry.

A bird-lover has voiced his outrage after he spotted a remote-control plane being used to purposefully swoop at sea eagles.</p>
<p>Wildlife photographer Anthony Robertson was taking pictures of birds at Don in northern Tasmania last week when he noticed the sea eagles being harassed.</p>
<p>Mr Robertson told Daily Mail Australia he saw a &lsquo;beautiful young White Belly Sea Eagle leaving a Macrocarpa Pine tree just before being chased by the remote-control plane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Wildlife photographer Anthony Robertson voiced his outrage after spotting two White Bellied Sea eagles being intentionally swooped at by a remote-control plane (pictured)</p>
<p>Mr Robertson photographed the attack (pictured) at Don, in Northern Tasmania, last week</p>
<p>&lsquo;I observed this eagle fly out over the river, its mate flew up to fly around with it and it was far enough away that we initially thought there were three sea eagles,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Robertson then looked through his superzoom camera lens and saw the birds were being attacked by a blue and white toy aircraft.</p>
<p>Using his 600mm lens, Mr Robertson captured several images of the model airplane chasing and diving at the eagles.</p>
<p>Mr Robertson said: &lsquo;The eagles then fled to the cover of some gum trees by the riverside.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The wildlife enthusiast said he was outraged at the attack on birds which are classed as a &lsquo;vulnerable&rsquo; species in Tasmania.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I had witnessed,&rsquo; Mr Robertson said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As I drove home I started to get angrier and angrier.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope it is just young person that regrets what they have done but in this society, who can tell,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Robertson said he contacted the Department of Primary Industries Parks, Water and Environment to report the incident.</p>
<p>The Department’s Manager of Policy, Advice and Regulatory Services, Andrew Crane, said: &lsquo;Eagles are territorial and will defend their territory from threats but they can also be easily spooked by model aircraft as well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is plenty of evidence to show that eagle species will interact with drones or model planes and are likely to be injured, often fatally,&rsquo; Mr Crane said.</p>
<p>He noted the Department’s Investigation and Enforcement Section were undertaking inquiries.</p>
<p>Mr Robertson&rsquo;s pictures were also shared around social media by other concerned bird-lovers.</p>
<p>One Facebook user wrote: &lsquo;This person needs to be stopped.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another commenter asked: &lsquo;Seriously what is wrong with some people?&rsquo;

<h3 id="roaming-sea-eagles-now-thought-to-have-settled-permanently-in-the-north-york-moors">&ldquo;Roaming sea eagles now thought to have settled permanently in the North York Moors&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.whitbygazette.co.uk/webimg/QVNIMTE1NjkwMTgy.jpg" alt="img">
The beautiful - and rabbit-filled - North York Moors National Park appears to be the sea eagles&rsquo; new habitat</p>
<p>The white-tailed eagles are native to Britain but were hunted to extinction by 1918, when the last bird was shot in Scotland, although they vanished from England in the 18th century. The young male and female come from a small population of four that was reintroduced to the Isle of Wight last summer.</p>
<p>Although the birds remained closer to the island throughout the winter, as the weather improved they began to roam around the country, with two making their way to the North York Moors National Park.</p>
<p>Sea eagles were reintroduced to the Isle of Wight last summer and have begun to spread their wings and explore</p>
<p>They were first spotted in April and their GPS trackers revealed they had previously flown around central and eastern England and that the male had visited the Peak District.</p>
<p>The juveniles spend the first few years of their life exploring before returning to their birthplace to breed when they are four to five years old.</p>
<p>Ecologists from Forestry England and the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation have been monitoring the activity of the North York Moors pair and it was expected that they would only remain in the area for a short length of time.</p>
<p>Yet an update from the charity has now confirmed that they are believed to have permanently settled in the moors.</p>
<p>The male, tagged as G393, has spent the entire month of May in the National Park and the female, G318, has been spending &lsquo;prolonged&rsquo; periods of time with him since May 27.</p>
<p>He was the most adventurous of the four birds released on the Isle of Wight, travelling over 1,000 miles between March 20 and April 30. He first visited the North York Moors between April 5-12, returning again on April 30 after his spell in the Peak District. He crossed over Huddersfield, Leeds and York during the three-hour, 72-mile journey.</p>
<p>Since then, apart from a flight to the coast at Loftus, near Redcar, he has remained in the local area.</p>
<p>Initially, he occupied an area to the south of that where the female, who arrived in the North York Moors on April 5, had been seen. They met on May 1, but did not begin to spend more time together for almost another month.</p>
<p>According to the conservationists studying their movements, &lsquo;rabbits are abundant&rsquo; at the locations where the pair have been recorded, reducing the need for them to range further afield. They spent long periods of May &lsquo;perched&rsquo; rather than travelling.</p>
<p>The other two birds released onto the island last August have remained on the south coast.</p>
<p>It is now hoped that the Yorkshire pair will remain together and eventually breed in the area when they reach maturity.</p>
<p>Sea eagles from Europe are also occasionally seen in Britain and the project has been able to track the arrivals of these continental visitors as well.</p>
<p>Sea eagle facts from Forestry England</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>White-tailed eagles can live to the age of 25, and do not breed until they are five years old. In their first two years they explore widely, learning the landscape as they go and often roaming 200km from their nest site, sometimes even beyond that. Once they get closer to maturity most return to their home range, the Solent in this case, and the males will set up territory in hope of finding a mate. Then, hopefully, they will breed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bird suffered a similar fate in Europe and became extinct in France in the 1950s, but strongholds survived in Scandinavia and their populations have begun to recover. The nearest population is in the Netherlands, and reintroduced birds live in Scotland and Ireland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Five eagles from Europe are thought to have visited Britain over winter - a three-year-old bird from Sweden was tracked to the New Forest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although there were sightings of the North York Moors male as he explored Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire over the winter, the project managers say there have been surprisingly few sightings of the eagles on the move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They were reintroduced to the west coast of Scotland in the 1970s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They feed on fish, birds, mammals and carrion.
