<p>In the sample clues below, the links take you to little explainers from our For Beginners series.</p>
<p>Best laid themes</p>
<p>If you’re new to cryptic crosswords, hello. (That doesn’t mean, to be clear, that I’m withholding a hello from seasoned solvers; I know we’re all prone to oversensitivity.)</p>
<p>Most cryptics have no themes: they’re like a collection of 30-odd mini-posers that interlock. Sometimes, though, you notice a connection between some of the words you’re writing in. Most often, this is unannounced but hard to miss, like the one from Crucible (who we interviewed here) with this corker of a clue:</p>
<p>25ac Shell supports her in painting atrophied bananas (9)</p>
<p>[wordplay: anagram (“bananas”) of ATROPHIED]</p>
<p>[definition: she is a figure who is supported by a shell in a painting]</p>
<p>It reads like a description of an oil company trying to recover its reputation by funding the work of an artist with fairly unpleasant output. But most words are doing something quite different to how they appear.</p>
<p>“Shell” is not a proper noun; “painting” is not a verb; “bananas” is not a noun and the tricksy-looking “atrophied” is just the word we need to jumble to get APHRODITE, as Venus is known in ancient Greece. So once PLATO and MINOTAUR and the rest start to appear, the theme becomes clear.</p>
<p>In other puzzles, it is possible to finish, with all entries correct and much fun had, without noticing there was a theme there at all. So it is with Raich, who starts off like this (skip to the next section if you think you might enjoy this amusing puzzle):</p>
<p>6ac On returning, well off, embracing wife in city (7)</p>
<p>[wordplay: ON (“On”) backwards (“returning”) + synonym for “well off” containing (“embracing”) abbrev for “wife”]</p>
<p>[ON + RICH containing W]</p>
<p>[definition: city]</p>
<p>Indeed, you easily could solve the clues for OFF, READY and WHEN I COME HOME without spotting any connection, and possibly even the clue …</p>
<p>16d Hear thieves? Nonsense! (8)</p>
<p>[wordplay: soundalike (“hear”) of a word meaning “thieves”]</p>
<p>[soundalike of nickers]</p>
<p>[definition: expression equivalent to “Nonsense!]</p>
<p>… for KNICKERS might not remind you of that acronym that Mary Whitehouse found so objectionable.</p>
<p>Latter patter</p>
<p>Talking of acronyms you might find in a second-world-war film, here’s Brendan with a clue that doesn’t take the usual approach to wordplay:</p>
<p>17ac First characters assembled in military mess (5)</p>
<p>The puzzle has a beginnings-and-endings theme, including this clue …</p>
<p>14ac Initial combination that’s familiar in a mass (7)</p>
<p>[wordplay: synonym for “familiar” (as a noun) inside A (“a”) &amp; scientific abbrev. for “mass”]</p>
<p>[CRONY inside A &amp; M]</p>
<p>[definition: initial combination]</p>
<p>… for ACRONYM, and the acronym LASER is clued with reference to its being an acronym, as is the “military mess” one, SNAFU.</p>
<p>We looked recently at how the Fanny Adams in “sweet FA” is a person called Fanny Adams, and not a stand-in phrase to represent some swearing (the sweary sense was applied later). We’re probably all familiar with what the F in SNAFU is doing: by contrast, it absolutely refers directly to the F-word. And so if you were the kind of person who expects that language will behave in predictable ways, and that origin determines meaning, you would expect “snafu” to be much ruder than “sweet FA”.</p>
<p>Language can be a contrary beast, though. “Sweet FA” retains a bit of spice even today, whereas “snafu” shows up unapologetically in the headlines of the New York Times …</p>
<p>THE DOWNING OF FLIGHT 655; Military Errors: The Snafu as History (1988)</p>
<p>D‐Day at Dover a Snafu As US Dinghy Capsizes (1975)</p>
<p>The 5:54 “Snafu” Explained Fully (1974)</p>
<p>… even in more buttoned-up eras …</p>
<p>Snafu in Vietnam (1964)</p>
<p>HITS IN THE HINTERLANDS? SOLVING A SNAFU IN “NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS” (1956)</p>
<p>… and the Times is a newspaper that gets complaints when its crossword has SCUMBAG as an answer, because of something that word used to mean. Maybe SNAFU’s being such a pleasing collection of sounds helps it avoid the pitchforks.</p>
<p>Other times, a word or phrase causes a stink because of an original meaning that never really existed. “Rule of thumb” has nothing to do with archaic and barbarous laws, and there is likewise no problem with the subject of our next challenge. There was a brief and confusing conversation about whether it originated in the slave trade (it didn’t), culminating in the Guardian introducing a typo to a letter from our foremost lexicographer of slang. Reader, how would you clue NITTY-GRITTY?</p>
<p>Cluing competition</p>
<p>Many thanks for your clues for BUMPTIOUS. I thought it had potential, then, after publication, wondered whether the letters were unhelpful. I was wrong to worry. The whole thing is worth your perusal, for such plausible surfaces as Jabberwox’s “Obnoxious bum is up to no good”, Croquem’s “Forward? Behind? I spout rubbish!” and Patjberry’s now hyphenless “Mixed up, but I’m so cocky?”</p>
<p>The audacity award goes to Encota for the not-that-audacious-by-our-standards “Over-confident recycled computer business chucks out broken screens”.</p>
<p>The runners-up are Lizard’s striking “Swaggering tramp beginning to prance round in new suit” and PeterMooreFuller’s splendid “Bang on time with bills — pleased with yourself?”; the winner is Schroduck’s warming “Sign of pregnancy: this ovum’s oddly puffed up”.</p>
<p>Clue of the Fortnight</p>
<p>Thank you to all setters for the comfort of puzzles. I’m almost reluctant to single out any clue, but this sign-off is always a good opportunity to share a smile. So let’s enjoy what the Sunday Telegraph setter makes the final word do in this clue …</p>
<p>11ac Site of traffic island for pedestrian (6-2-3-4)</p>
<p>[double definition, first ignoring punctuation, second more allusive]</p>
<p>… for MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD. Take care.

<h3 id="costumes-or-coronavirus-synagogues-cancel-purim-celebrations">&ldquo;Costumes or coronavirus? Synagogues cancel Purim celebrations.&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7SOAWBS7YMI6VLCQDBYB4FHANU.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
Daphne’s mom, Susan Greene, she said she and her family still plan to go to the Purim events at their synagogue, Romemu. She shrugged and said she expects to get the virus eventually, because she and her two daughters pick up so many illnesses in school.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do?” she said. “You’re supposed to be happy for Purim.”</p>
<p>As of Friday afternoon, New York state had confirmed 33 cases of the coronavirus — 29 of them connected to an attorney, with many of those centered on his modern Orthodox synagogue in New Rochelle, which has been shut down until further notice.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Washington, D.C.’s Adas Israel Congregation on Friday canceled its Purim carnival and the party scheduled for after services Monday night. Elsewhere in the United States, Temple De Hirsch Sinai in Seattle shelved its plans for a Star Wars-themed Purim program, and a massive Purim party was reportedly canceled in Lakewood, N.J. Celebrations in places like Israel and Italy also have been canceled.</p>
<p>The historic Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue on New York’s Upper West Side neighborhood will hold Purim services, but the planned dinner and celebration won’t take place, according to Rabbi Emeritus Marc D. Angel. Ansche Chesed synagogue on the Upper West Side also canceled its carnival as a precaution but will hold a service on Monday. Park East Synagogue did the same.</p>
<p>“Usually Purim is the most joyous time,” said Rabbi Benjamin Goldschmidt, assistant rabbi at Park East, which has almost 1,000 members. “My hope is that we’ll wear masks, not out of protection.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Goldschmidt said this Purim could hold extra symbolism because the holiday is about the hidden danger for the Jewish people.</p>
<p>“Purim is considered a celebration of hidden miracles,” he said. “Hidden or unhidden, we definitely need some divine intervention over here.”</p>
<p>Rabbi Matthew Green, assistant rabbi of Congregation Beth Elohim in Brooklyn, said that the synagogue, in an effort to reduce contact with surfaces touched by other people, will not supply party masks or groggers — noisemakers that are traditionally shaken to drown out the name of the villain Haman during the chanting of the Purim story.</p>
<p>The synagogue is also placing hamantaschen, the traditional triangular cookie with jelly filling, in individual bags instead of large trays. The bags are &ldquo;not great for the environment, but our best bet, all things considered this week,” Green said in an email.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun, a modern Orthodox synagogue on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, expects more than 2,000 people on Purim, compared with average Shabbat attendance of about 800 people. The virus felt like a distant threat until this week, when the cases in New Rochelle and the New York area were reported, said Senior Rabbi Chaim Steinmetz.</p>
<p>“Feeling insecure and threatened is a very uncomfortable place to be,” Steinmetz said. “But I see a lot of a resilience and determination to meet whatever challenges we face. That’s the story of Esther and is one of the grand themes of Jewish history.”</p>
<p>Rabbi Motti Seligson, spokesman for Chabad, a Brooklyn-based organization of Hasidic Jews, said Chabad groups are probably going to wait until Monday to make changes for Purim celebrations, if they are needed.</p>
<p>“It feels very hysterical almost with the panic,” he said. “We’ve been sharing the recommendations and the caution that health officials are suggesting while also trying to avoid anything that may feed into panic.”</p>
<p>Some traditional denominations of Judaism teach that the Megillah, or the book of Esther, must be heard aloud in person on Purim. This year, the Rabbinical Assembly, a body of Conservative rabbis, issued guidance stating: “Hearing the Megillah being read via telephone or live streaming, is permitted when necessary, so long as the sound is undistorted, live and not a recording.&rdquo;</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The Rabbinical Council of America, a body of Orthodox rabbis, also issued general guidance for hygienic behavior in synagogues.</p>
<p>Some of the guidelines include asking people not to kiss their fingertips and then touch their hands to Torah scrolls, which is customary during weekday and Sabbath prayer services, and not to make that gesture with mezuzot, the scrolls containing verses of Scripture that Jews place on the doorposts of their homes, business and communal institutions.</p>
<p>In Montgomery County, Maryland, where the first three coronavirus cases were reported Thursday, Rabbi Adam Raskin of Congregation Har Shalom said the Torah will not be paraded around the sanctuary on Saturday; people will be told not to touch the covered scrolls. After services, the challah will be cut with a knife, instead of having children tear it into pieces. Raskin said the congregation will livestream Purim service, but has not canceled its carnival or celebrations.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Other religious groups have also altered their traditions because of the virus: Christians are issuing guidance around taking Communion, and the spread has altered Muslims’ pilgrimage plans.</p>
<p>Several Jewish leaders said they have instructed their members to put their own health above any religious ritual.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a 13-year-old in Manhattan celebrated a “virtual bar mitzvah” through the online platform Zoom, with hundreds of friends and relatives watching on their phones or computers, according to the Wall Street Journal. The scheduled ceremony at a synagogue was canceled because the teenager and many of his classmates were under quarantine after they had attended a bat mitzvah in New Rochelle. A man who was later diagnosed with coronavirus was also at that event.</p>
<p>A kosher grocery on the Upper West Side was bustling Thursday night, as customers were placing orders for the hamantaschen at the bakery counter.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Filling up her basket with jelly filling to make her own version of the holiday pastries, Reina, who spoke on the condition that her last name not be used for privacy reasons, answered her 9-year-old son Asher’s questions about Purim. What if, he asked, you’re listening to the mandatory Megillah reading, and someone sneezes and you can’t hear some of it? That person shouldn’t be in synagogue in the first place, Reina replied.</p>
<p>“People want to maintain what it is to celebrate the holiday in its fullest,” said Reina, who is a pediatric nurse and plans to attend her synagogue’s Purim festivities. “You have to figure out the best way to do it.”</p>
<p>Shira Telushkin, a 29-year-old Jewish writer in Brooklyn, said she and some of her friends — all daughters of rabbis — are planning to dress up as “rabbinical Cats,” with a nod to the “Cats” musical that came out as a movie last year. They plan to dress in all black and cat ears and a tallit, a traditional Jewish prayer shawl.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“If stuff gets canceled, we’ll meet in my apartment because we all have our cats costumes and don’t want them to go to waste,” Telushkin said. “It’s the most fun holiday.”</p>
<p>Shira Dicker, who belongs to Romemu on the Upper West Side, said that her synagogue has the most “over-the-top” Purim celebrations.</p>
<p>“This is the best place for costumes. People do social critique or political critique. They’re usually screamingly clever,” she said. “People have talked about coming as a Corona beer. They’re trying to keep it classy, not trashy or traumatic.”</p>
<p>As of Thursday, the party was on track.</p>
<p>“We have a DJ and have an insane dance party. People drink, they’ll have a bar. Are we going to be partying like it’s 1999?” Dicker wondered out loud. “What will the protocol be with cups?”</p>
<p>But the party was canceled on Friday.</p>
<p>In the West Side Judaica &amp; Bookstore, Elizabeth Schultz-Zimmer stopped to buy some books and some gifts of nuts and candy for Purim. She called her rabbi at Chabad of Sutton Place to check on Purim services. The synagogue is open for business, he said.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Schultz-Zimmer, whose Hebrew name is Esther, said she loves the story of Purim because of the holiday’s hidden symbolism and the ultimate triumph of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>“Nothing will dampen the spirits of the Jewish people,” she said as she turned to the store manager. “Did I say it right? I’m not a rabbi.”</p>
<p>He nodded.

<p><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/fdLPerkuxRixXcp_eFhIJNpzqhw=/0x554:5607x3474/960x500/media/img/mt/2019/10/IMG_8283/original.jpg" alt="img"></p>

<p>Eric Lidji is a man who cares deeply about modest ambitions. He has lived in Pittsburgh on and off for 20 years. It is a city perfectly sized to his sensibility, neither very small nor very large—a place known to but mostly ignored by those who do not live there. Lidji, 36, has held many jobs; most recently, in late 2017, he became the director and only permanent staff member of the Rauh Jewish History Program &amp; Archives, a repository of early-20th-century local Yiddish-theater posters as well as records from dozens of small-town synagogues in western Pennsylvania. But even before he became an archivist, Lidji’s work has always been the same: He is a diarist of small delights, a chronicler of curios, an ardent psalmist of Pittsburgh’s quirky charms. Like many of the 49,000 other Jews in the Pittsburgh area, Lidji was socializing at a local synagogue on the final Saturday in October last year when he heard the first rumors of a shooting at the nearby Tree of Life synagogue. The news was soon confirmed: Eleven Jewish worshippers had been murdered. Lidji felt paralyzed: Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest, was still ongoing, and he wasn’t sure what to do. It wasn’t until a few hours later that something clicked, and Lidji felt a certain desperation stirring alongside his sorrow. Already, people were laying artwork and stones, which Jews customarily place on graves, on the sidewalk around the synagogue where the shooting had taken place. Many of the accumulating objects were fragile and homemade, with no clear owner or steward, left outside without protection against Pittsburgh’s notoriously wet weather. This was not just an outpouring of grief, but a proliferation of artifacts—artifacts that, in Lidji’s view, should be preserved.</p>
<p>To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app. On the Monday morning after the shooting, Lidji met with half a dozen colleagues who work in other divisions of Pittsburgh’s Heinz History Center, where the Jewish archives are housed. Together they formed a task force, fanning out to as many vigils, funerals, and religious services as they could. They filled their bags with copies of programs and approached speakers after public events, asking them for their notes. Whenever Lidji spotted someone carrying a sign, he would hurry over and hand them a business card, hoping they would call him when the card reappeared at the bottom of a purse or in a pocket emptied for laundry and offer to donate what they had made. Sometimes he felt overwhelmed. On the Tuesday after the shooting, he showed up at a protest against President Donald Trump in Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh’s historic Jewish neighborhood, to find thousands of people gathered in the streets carrying signs and banners. “It felt like … archiving the ocean,” he told me.</p>
<p>The grim reality of Jewish history is that Lidji is not the first archivist of his kind. Medieval Jews buried family heirlooms in the walls of their houses in times of plague, fearing that they might be blamed for the disease. Scholars founded the Yiddish institute YIVO in the early 20th century, recruiting ordinary Eastern European villagers to collect photographs and folktales of a culture threatened by pogroms and mass migration. Emanuel Ringelblum led a covert effort to collect and bury artifacts documenting life in the Warsaw Ghetto in the early years of the Holocaust, before its inhabitants were murdered and its remaining structures burned to the ground.</p>
<p>Archives neither predict nor prevent atrocities. They document what has happened, but remain neutral about what is to come. Their purpose is to endure as a monument to smallness, a reminder that history is in part a composite of stories about little lives. The purpose of Lidji’s archive is to keep what happened at Tree of Life from being reduced to “Pittsburgh, synagogue shooting, 11 dead,” and nothing more. Every morning, Lidji rises in the 4 o’clock hour, when it is still dark. He was in the midst of renovations on his house in the Garfield neighborhood when he got the job at the archives, and now lives spartanly in three semi-habitable rooms upstairs. His morning ritual begins with grinding coffee beans from Zeke’s, the shop beloved by locals in East Liberty, the next neighborhood over. Then he puts on a pot of beans and rice or something similar for breakfast. He glances at The New York Times and local Pittsburgh papers to read the headlines and, only a little jokingly, to make sure Jews are still allowed in this country. He finally takes his place at his desk and begins to write. Lidji started keeping a new kind of diary on October 27: notes about what he’s collected, whom he’s talked to, what the community seems to be feeling. He types quickly, with no poetry or flourish—the goal is to export as much as he can from memory to paper. After a couple of hours, he packs up his things and leaves for the next stop in his day: morning minyan, a gathering of 10 or more Jews for prayer.</p>
<p>[Read: The fight to make meaning out of a massacre] Since the attack, Lidji has experienced a personal religious transformation: After nearly 15 years of haphazard Jewish observance, he started attending services every day. But there were other reasons to show up for prayer: It has proved a useful venue for winning people over to the cause of archival collection. Documenting history is often the last task on any community’s mind, all the more so during a time of grief. Prior to the shooting, the archives mainly served as a repository for records from at least three dozen local synagogues, each with its own distinct religious identity or immigrant population; for miscellanea, such as World War II–era correspondence and photographs of big groups at synagogue anniversary dinners and holiday events; and for files from 75 small-town Jewish communities scattered across western Pennsylvania. It holds at least one item from nearly every Jewish organization that has ever existed in Pittsburgh, Lidji told me. And yet, that work was largely hidden to all but the city’s biggest history buffs. After the attack, Lidji’s first big challenge was becoming more visible to the community: being unobtrusively, insistently present at memorial events, and building relationships with community leaders. His second big challenge was convincing the Pittsburgh Jewish community that its history is worth preserving.</p>
<p>The first time Lidji felt “any sense of accomplishment,” he told me, was when a man who had been “polite but reticent” about the archival project came over during morning minyan one day and announced that he had found “the perfect object.” On the day of the shooting, a boy had been celebrating his bar mitzvah at an Orthodox synagogue about a mile away from Tree of Life, and continued the service even as news of the shooting reached the community. The bentscher, or book containing the prayers said after meals, captured the moment perfectly, the man told Lidji: It featured the boy’s name and the starry Pittsburgh Steelers logo wrapped around the date, 10.27.18. Lidji eventually got hold of one of the bentschers.</p>
<p>The most significant items Lidji has collected have what he calls “the shine,” a certain raw, emotional quality that indicates an object’s clear connection to the past. In the week after the attack, students at the Hillel Jewish University Center of Pittsburgh gathered and expressed their feelings on Post-its. “My childhood illusion of security as a Jew was shattered,” one student wrote. Lidji and his colleagues collected programs from memorial events, some more pointed than others: A community with a large Bhutanese population hosted a vigil, where attendees seemed to feel acutely the dangers of being an ethnic minority. A large Reform Jewish congregation, Rodef Shalom, hosted a small event where the preschool director reported that ever since the attack, the children had been obsessed with building elaborate protective structures out of blocks. For whatever reason, people donated stacks upon stacks of I voted stickers from the November 6, 2018, election printed with the “Stronger than hate” logo designed to commemorate the attack. Lidji also collected bags of black paper strips, which protesters had torn, mimicking a Jewish funeral custom, during the Trump protest to symbolize their grief over the shooting and their dismay at the president’s arrival. Eighteen days after the shooting, the impromptu memorial that had covered the sidewalks, fences, and bushes around the Tree of Life synagogue finally came down; it took roughly a dozen people nine hours to take it apart. They laid everything out on paper, and a local business owner agreed to take the flowers for composting. Some of the volunteers, however, felt too pained to throw the stems away, so they made bundles to dry and preserve. Once summer arrived, the dried bouquets threatened to start decomposing in the business owner’s un-air-conditioned house, so he asked Lidji to come get them. Lidji now has crates of these flowers in his house.</p>
<p>A few weeks after the attack, Lidji got a call from a local family who wanted to donate a sign they made for the first memorial vigil, on the night of the shooting. When the mother brought her two children, 3 and 5, to the archives, the older child asked why they had to give the sign away. Sometimes, Lidji told her, things are so important that we have to make sure they will be around for a really long time. Right, the girl’s mom added. One day, you will be able to bring your grandchildren to see this sign.</p>
<p>[Read: The Jews of Pittsburgh bury their dead] In late summer, Lidji picked up several vanloads’ worth of material from Jewish organizations around town, ranging from condolence notes to quilts to paper cranes they had received in the preceding months. Lidji said it will probably take him at least a year to go through it all. And there’s more: Tree of Life and the other two congregations that were in the building during the shooting received an estimated 10,000 letters in the days after the attack. It is unclear where they will end up. “People will tell this story someday, and they’re going to tell it using this information that we’ve all left behind for them,” Lidji told me. “We’ve only done as good a job as we could do. We couldn’t save everything.” The Heinz History Center is in a brick warehouse, the site of an old ice company in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, within sight of the Allegheny River. Named for Senator H. John Heinz III, the heir to the Heinz ketchup fortune, the center holds a variety of collections pertaining to western Pennsylvania, about such topics as the history of sports and the French and Indian War. The Rauh Jewish Archives—really just Lidji’s cubicle—sit on the sixth floor. When I met Lidji there late last spring, he seemed exhausted. By now he really had two full-time jobs: Pittsburgh’s Jewish archivist, and archivist of the Tree of Life attack. The trove he is building will one day contain a large portion of the shooting’s physical imprint. Alone, these objects may seem insignificant, but together, they show the arc of this community’s grief: Poster-board signs made in solidarity, and in protest. Letters from around the world. Handicrafts and other offerings. A digital collection of community members’ posts and messages about the attack. Clips from local news outlets and Jewish media. Programs from events, the texts of speeches and sermons. Anything and everything that can be touched and seen, Lidji hopes to collect.</p>
<p>Dispositionally speaking, Lidji is geared much more toward pleasantly mundane local drama than toward grand narratives of history. He had been devising small-scale local-history projects long before he took up his formal post at the archives. Before last October, one of his projects at the archives was tracing the rivalry between two competing Yiddish-theater producers who had set up shop in Pittsburgh in the 1920s. He loved that the letters outlining their feuds were written in a spirit of high dudgeon, befitting their craft. Related Stories The Jews of Pittsburgh Bury Their Dead</p>
<p>The Fight to Make Meaning Out of a Massacre</p>
<p>What If They’re Not Coming for the Jews This Time? Lidji has had to figure out how to start telling the story of the Pittsburgh shooting, a story with much larger and darker implications than any he’s had to tell before. At first, it was Jewish organizations in and around Pittsburgh that approached him to help them make sense of the shooting—the Orthodox yeshiva where he went to high school, an area synagogue where one of the victims’ children attend services. Eventually, he started getting requests from people who live farther afield. In June, Lidji spoke at a convention in Colorado of mostly non-Orthodox chevrot kadisha, or sacred societies, made up of the members of Jewish communities who oversee the washing and burial of the dead. The convention was held not long after a gunman allegedly killed 51 people and wounded dozens more in a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, and also not long after a 19-year-old man allegedly opened fire in a synagogue in Poway, California, murdering one woman and injuring three others, including a rabbi and an 8-year-old girl.</p>
<p>Lidji began his talk with a story he sometimes tells when he’s trying to explain the deeper meaning of the archives project. Psalm 90 begins, “A prayer of Moses, the man of God.” According to Jewish tradition, most of the Psalms were composed by King David, who was born centuries after Moses died. How, Lidji asked, could David have known what Moses had said in his prayers?</p>
<p>In answer, Lidji offered his interpretation of a line from the Radak, a medieval Jewish commentator, painting a scene of dramatic discovery: King David, unable to sleep and wandering around his palace at night, finds a pottery jar containing a mysterious scroll bearing Moses’s prayers. How meaningful it must have been, Lidji said, for David to hold in his hands the words of the Jewish tradition’s greatest prophet. Psalm 90 itself describes how insignificant human events must seem to God: For in Your sight, a thousand years are like … a watch of the night. And yet the Jewish people, Lidji explained, have been able to maintain continuity in part because their archives have let them “come back later and be reminded.” The bar mitzvah boy who persevered through his prayers even as his synagogue went on lockdown will one day die. The little girl who gave her sign to the archives will one day die. From dust to dust: A century hence, no one who witnessed the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and its aftermath will be around to explain why they loved Squirrel Hill. If it survives, Lidji’s archive will be all that’s left to tell a more textured story. Depending on what comes next, those stones and signs and notes of grief could tell radically different stories: of a rare aberration in American Jewish history, or the restarting of an ancient clock.

<h3 id="repeated-attacks-on-jewish-community-heighten-fears">&ldquo;Repeated attacks on Jewish community heighten fears&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a3d442/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3780x1985+0+263/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F72%2Fa7%2Fdd15a23143b189dab98e8fdb2bca%2Fap19363755077364.jpg" alt="img">
First, a gunman targeted a kosher grocery store in Jersey City in early December. Then, just days later, a Beverly Hills synagogue was vandalized. That’s when Natalie and her husband started assessing the danger of practicing their religion: Should he go to synagogue? Are their kids’ schools safe? In the end, they decided to keep their four children away from any public celebration of their Orthodox Jewish faith.</p>
<p>And now, after a machete-wielding assailant terrorized a Hanukkah celebration in Monsey, N.Y., on Saturday night, the Los Angeles woman said she didn’t know where to turn for safety. In 21st century America. On the eve of a new decade. As anti-Semitic violence is on the rise.</p>
<p>“I’m not sending my young kids to synagogue. I’m keeping them at home with me,” said Natalie, who preferred to be identified only by her middle name because she feared for her family’s safety. Those who attack Jews because of their faith “want people to be afraid to go to synagogue. At the end of the day, I have to protect my children and their lives. &hellip; That’s the goal of the terrorist: to instill fear at all times.”</p>
<p>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called the attack “domestic terrorism” and said it was one of 13 acts of anti-Semitism in his state since Dec. 8. He also directed the state police hate crimes task force to investigate, according to a statement on his website. Five people were injured in the machete attack, one seriously; the suspect fled to Manhattan and was later arrested.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The bloody assault — which occurred at the home of a Hasidic rabbi, where many of the faithful were celebrating the seventh night of Hanukkah — reverberated throughout the country.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, home to one of the largest Jewish populations in the country, police Chief Michel Moore tweeted Sunday that “out of an abundance of caution, we have increased patrols in and around Jewish communities and places of worship in response to last night’s horrific anti-Semitic attack in New York.”</p>
<p>And Mayor Eric Garcetti, who is Jewish, tweeted Sunday: “The tragic attacks on faith communities in New York &amp; Texas seek to make us afraid in our homes &amp; sanctuaries, the places where we should feel safest. But we refuse to live in fear. We will respond to anti-semitism &amp; all forms of hate &amp; violence with courage, solidarity &amp; love.”</p>
<p>In addition to the attack in Monsey, Garcetti referred to a church shooting Sunday not far from Fort Worth, in which two people died and the gunman was shot to death by other members of the congregation.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also pledged a “visible, strong police presence around the Jewish community” in his city. Interviewed on Fox News, he called growing anti-Semitism “profoundly dangerous.” “An atmosphere of hate has been developing in this country over the last few years,” De Blasio said. “A lot of it is emanating from Washington, and it’s having an effect on all of us.”</p>
<p>When Fox News host Ed Henry accused him of “blaming the president,” De Blasio replied: “Not just the president.”</p>
<p>He added: “But we have to be clear. We need a different tone, starting in Washington.”</p>
<p>Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center and Museum of Tolerance, however, does not place the onus of rising anti-Semitism on the White House and a president who has coarsened civic discourse during his three years in office.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“This is a world phenomenon,” Hier said Sunday. “It has happened for the last decade in Europe. It crossed the Atlantic. It’s right here in America. And the crimes are being committed by fellow Americans, in the last few weeks, by African Americans. I have to tell you, this is really of deep concern. Unless we do something about it, it seems to me it’s going to get a lot worse.”</p>
<p>Hier said the center and the museum had employed armed guards and security cameras since 1999, when white supremacist Buford O. Furrow Jr. scoped out the museum as a possible target, a place to kill Jews. But the museum was too secure. Instead, Furrow shot five people at the North Valley Jewish Community Center and later shot and killed a Filipino American postal worker.</p>
<p>Security cameras also have been installed at Hier’s home and the residences of “all of the senior people” of the Los Angeles institutions, he said.</p>
<p>“Any car or anything that drives around the block is immediately identified,” Hier said. It is a horrible way to live, “but this is America. We have to address this. &hellip; I’d like to see Republicans and Democrats put their bickering aside and deal with anti-Semitism.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Hier called for Trump to ask the FBI to create a special task force to address the rising problem, which he called “squarely about Jews.” He said he also would raise the issue during a private audience with Pope Francis on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>“Since 1977 when the Simon Wiesenthal Center opened, we’ve never seen, one after another, such horrific attacks targeting Jews — at night and in broad daylight,” Hier said. “I do not recall any time I’ve been as concerned as I am now. We’re in uncharted territory. Unless we do something, the results will be horrific and unprecedented in American history.”</p>
<p>As Hier noted, the assailants in the two high-profile attacks were African American. In the Jersey City incident, three people inside the store and a police officer were killed. The two crimes were a terrible braid of race and religion.</p>
<p>All of which creates a very particular type of pain for people like Rebecca Pierce. The San Francisco Bay Area writer and filmmaker is both black and Jewish. She spends much of her work and her life dealing with that difficult territory.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>When she hears about attacks such as Saturday’s, “my first reaction as a Jewish person is, ‘It’s horrible,’” Pierce said Sunday. “Any time a prayer space or community space is violated, I’m horrified and heartbroken.”</p>
<p>If the assailant is black, she said, “a lot of time black Jews feel we have to mediate between the communities, when we’re just as frightened and hurt and upset about the violence as anyone else. &hellip; The minute I thought a black person did it, I’m horrified, but I also know that I’ll have to do something about it.”</p>
<p>Pierce said she understood some synagogues’ desire to increase police presence, but she also noted that the question of safety was very different depending on a person’s racial background.</p>
<p>“When you have something like the Monsey attack, people will call for more police presence,” she said. “But for communities on the receiving end of policing, it won’t make you feel more safe. &hellip; When there’s been an attack, any kind of attack, I’m scared. I’m also scared of the police. When you go into a synagogue and you look different from other people, you feel uneasy.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The Monsey attack also was front and center on the Sunday morning political talk shows.</p>
<p>By early Sunday afternoon, Trump had still not weighed in on the assault, although he twice took to Twitter earlier in the day to denigrate “Crazy Nancy Pelosi” over his impeachment.</p>
<p>However, a senior congressional ally of the president, Rep. Steve Scalise, said, “Anti-Semitism is wrong.”</p>
<p>Scalise (R-La.), who survived a 2017 shooting attack by a gunman targeting Republicans, said on “Fox News Sunday” that “too often in Washington, you see people trying to figure out somebody’s motives instead of just saying it’s wrong. … Call it out for what it is.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Sen. John Kennedy (R-La)., another Trump ally, was asked in a separate televised interview whether there should be legislation that designates attacks like the one in New York as domestic terrorism.</p>
<p>“America is a big, wide-open, pluralistic country. I don’t think any of us want to live in a police state,” Kennedy said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “If I had an answer, I’d go pass a bill. But you can’t legislate hate away from people who have it in their heart. “</p>
<p>Trump finally commented just after 2 p.m. Eastern time, about 16 hours after the machete rampage took place, calling it “horrific.”</p>
<p>“We must all come together,” he tweeted, “to fight, confront and eradicate the evil scourge of anti-Semitism.”</p>
<p>La Ganga reported from Los Angeles and King from Washington, D.C. Times staff writer Sonja Sharp and the Associated Press contributed to this story.

A San Diego judge on Friday ordered a 20-year-old man to stand trial on charges of murder and attempted murder in the April shootings at a Poway synagogue.</p>
<p>John Timothy Earnest, of Rancho Peñasquitos, also faces one count of arson from a fire at an Escondido mosque on March 24.</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing for Earnest wrapped up after a final prosecution witness testified, through an interpreter, about being shot in a leg at Chabad of Poway on April 27.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>San Diego Superior Court Judge Peter Deddeh determined there was enough evidence presented at the hearing for Earnest’s case to move forward. Because of special-circumstance allegations of murder committed as a hate crime, prosecutors have the option of seeking the death penalty in his case.</p>
<p>That decision has not yet been made, Deputy District Attorney Leonard Trinh said after the hearing.</p>
<p>John T. Earnest, next to Public Defender’s Office investigator Dana Gary, listened on Friday during the second day of his preliminary hearing in San Diego Superior Court on charges related to the April 27 shootings at Chabad of Poway. A judge bound him over for trial on charges of murder, attempted murder and arson. (John Gibbins/The San Diego Union-Tribune)</p>
<p>Authorities believe the shootings were prompted by Earnest’s hatred of Jewish people, as expressed in an online “open letter” that he posted before the incident. In the letter, he said he made up his mind to commit the shooting after 51 people were killed and 49 injured in a March 15 shooting at a New Zealand mosque by a suspected white supremacist.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Earnest’s parents, who did not attend the hearing, issued an emailed statement Friday through an attorney, saying in part that, “As the justice systems conducts court hearings to hold our son accountable for his actions, we would would like people to know that we are deeply sorry that the victims of our son’s heinous actions are having to relive the awful events of that day.”</p>
<p>The statement continued, “We are deeply sorry that law enforcement officers and medical (personnel) are having to recall the terrible images they saw as they give testimony at the preliminary hearing.</p>
<p>“These thoughts and images overwhelm anyone seeing them, certainly the public and the first responders, but especially the family and friends of the victims. We are profoundly sorry for the grief everyone is suffering and we hope and pray for peace for everyone.”</p>
<p>The email said the parents would have no further public comment until the criminal case is resolved.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Witnesses testified on Thursday, the first day of the hearing, about the “chaos” that erupted inside the synagogue when the gunman opened fire, killing one person and wounding three others. Earnest was arrested in Rancho Bernardo shortly after the 11:20 a.m. shooting, with an AR-15 rifle, tactical helmet and five 10-cartridge magazines in his car.</p>
<p>He had called 911 and told a dispatcher: “I opened fire in a synagogue. I think I killed some people. Some man returned fire with a pistol. I got in my car and drove away.”</p>
<p>He surrendered peacefully to a San Diego police officer who found Earnest parked at West Bernardo Center Road and Rancho Bernardo Drive.</p>

<p>Earnest appeared to smirk when surveillance video was played in court of 60-year-old congregant Lori Gilbert-Kaye being shot down inside the lobby of the synagogue. During a break in the proceedings, he turned partly toward spectators and made a “hang-loose” gesture with one hand, thumb and little finger extended.</p>
<p>Almog Peretz, 34, an Israeli who had been visiting his sister and attending Chabad of Poway for several months, testified on Friday through a Hebrew-speaking interpreter that he heard a loud “boom” while he was in the synagogue’s adjoining social hall.</p>
<p>He said he wasn’t sure what caused the noise, so he took a few steps toward a door into the synagogue lobby.</p>
<p>“I saw his face,” Peretz said. “He was standing like this with his weapon. Like a soldier.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>He raised his hands as if aiming a rifle.</p>
<p>Peretz said he grabbed the 4-year-old daughter of a friend in one arm and his 8-year-old niece’s hand and ran for an exit that led to an outdoor playground full of children.</p>
<p>“Bullets were flying all around me,” he said. He said he didn’t notice it at the time, but he believes that’s when he and his niece, Noya Dahan, were wounded by the gunfire. Rounds or shrapnel hit each of them in one leg.</p>
<p>“I yelled to all the kids and I ran with all the kids toward the small gate,” Peretz recalled.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>He and a 15-year-old girl ushered the children into Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein’s nearby house. Then, he said, he realized he hadn’t seen where another of his nieces was, so he ran back to the synagogue to look for her.</p>
<p>“When I got back to the synagogue, I saw blood on my jeans,” Peretz said. “My right leg, in the back.”</p>
<p>Before he was ushered into an ambulance, he saw Gilbert-Kaye lying on the lobby floor.</p>
<p>Congregant Oscar Stewart testified on Thursday that he tried to revive the woman. Her husband, a doctor, came to help with CPR but when he realized that the unresponsive woman was his wife, he groaned and fainted, Stewart said. Gilbert-Kaye did not survive.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The rabbi, who had been in the lobby with Gilbert-Kaye when the shooting started, was wounded in both hands and lost a finger. He did not testify at the preliminary hearing.</p>
<p>Peretz said he spent a day in the hospital and learned he had also sprained his knee. Later, he had surgery on his leg, followed by many months of physical therapy. Just two months ago he was able to walk normally, he said.</p>
<p>Looking back on the day of the shooting, Peretz said, “I was also very confused in my head. My adrenaline was coursing. Up until now, I still feel the same.”</p>
<p>Earnest’s lawyer, Deputy Public Defender John O’Connell, asked Peretz a few questions about the events that day, then prosecutors concluded their case.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>O’Connell argued that the prosecution had not met the burden of proof to warrant trial on each count and allegation, but the judge disagreed.</p>
<p>After the hearing, an attorney who said he was representing Peretz in a civil matter, told reporters that his client is suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome because of the shooting.</p>
<p>Yoni Weinberg called Peretz “one of the bravest individuals I’ve ever met” for herding the children away from the gunman.</p>
<p>“He got 10 to 20 children to safety. He knows he saved their lives,” Weinberg said, but he added that having that knowledge hasn’t helped Peretz deal with the aftermath.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“It’s scary when you have that image burned in your head of a man in a militaristic vest aiming the rifle at you with the sole intention of taking away your life because of nothing other than your religion,” the attorney continued. “He’s always looking for the next John Earnest no matter where he is.”</p>
<p>Earnest is to return to court on Oct. 3 and a trial date may be set at that time.</p>
<p>He also faces a separate, 113-count federal indictment alleging hate crimes, using a firearm and obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs by using a dangerous weapon resulting in death and injury. He could face the death penalty in that case, which would be heard in federal court.</p>

A man who was wounded during a shooting at a suburban San Diego synagogue in April is suing the house of worship, alleging that Chabad of Poway did not use federal funds meant to hire security to protect its congregants.</p>
<p>In the 12-page lawsuit filed Friday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Almog Peretz says that the synagogue did not have proper security despite a rise in anti-Semitic attacks nationally and that it did not use a $150,000 grant to upgrade security measures.</p>
<p>For the record: An earlier version of this story misidentified a child Peretz brought to safety during the shooting as his daughter. Peretz grabbed his niece and another child and took them both out of the synagogue.</p>
<p>Officials at Chabad of Poway did not immediately return an emailed request seeking comment on the lawsuit.</p>

<p>Prosecutors have charged John Timothy Earnest with one count of murder and three counts of attempted murder in the April 27 attack at Chabad of Poway.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Earnest — 19 at the time — walked into the synagogue on the last day of Passover, the holiest of Jewish holidays, and opened fire. Surveillance video of the lobby of the Chabad shows a man firing an assault-style rifle from just outside the front door, hitting Lori Gilbert-Kaye, 60, as she turned to run. She died at the doors to the sanctuary after being shot twice from the back, according to a San Diego County deputy medical examiner.</p>
<p>Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein was the next person shot. Goldstein was wounded in both hands and lost the index finger on his right hand in the shooting.</p>

<p>San Diego County Deputy District Attorney Leonard Trinh said Earnest then turned toward a room where there were several people, including children, and fired his weapon. Among those in the room were Almog Peretz, 34, who was shot in the leg, and his niece, Noya Dahan, 8, who was struck in her face and a leg by bullet fragments.</p>
<p>When Peretz saw the gunman, he grabbed his niece by her arm, picked up another child and ran outside toward a playground filled with children. But when he noticed another of his nieces wasn’t with him, he ran back into the building. That’s when he noticed the blood on his pants and realized he had been shot.</p>
<p>In filing the lawsuit, Peretz said the synagogue breached its “duty of reasonable care” in protecting congregants.</p>
<p>Chabad of Poway received $150,000 from the government in March because the synagogue “believed that it was at risk of an anti-Semitic attack on its congregants,” according to the suit. But during the day of the attack, court documents show the building’s doors were unlocked and there were no guards, gates or other security measures in place.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The lawsuit references a 2014 ruling in which the California branch of the Hasidic Jewish group Chabad-Lubavitch misused federal funds meant for security upgrades and was forced to return $844,985 to the government for misappropriating funds they’d been granted to pay for security cameras.</p>
<p>In addition to Chabad of Poway, the suit names Chabad of California and Chabad International as well as Earnest and San Diego Guns, the store that sold the teen the rifle.</p>
<p>Peretz’s attorney, Yoni Weinberg, said his client may be perceived negatively for including the synagogue in the lawsuit, but he said it’s important to name everyone who may be at fault in the fatal attack.</p>
<p>“If we were only to have John Earnest in the lawsuit, changes would never get made,” Weinberg said. “Hopefully this pressure &hellip; influences them to make a change to protect their congregants and it influences other synagogues as well.”
