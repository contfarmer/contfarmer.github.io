<p>People have retweeted Naya’s post and have suggested that the tweet has connections to Eminem’s song ’97 Bonnie and Clyde’.</p>

<p>Eminem: ‘Just The Two Of Us’</p>
<p>While the song goes under the name ’97 Bonnie and Clyde’, it was called ‘Just The Two Of Us’ on the Slim Shady EP, Eminem’s debut extended play from 1997.</p>
<p>The song tells the story of a father, mother and a child who go together to a lake, while the lyrics also include disturbing content about the mom as she drowns in the lake.</p>
<p>Many critics have said that this is one of the rapper’s most controversial songs because of its dark lyrics.</p>
<p>Fans react on Twitter</p>
<p>A number of Twitter users have slammed the idea that Naya’s tweet has any references to Eminem’s song.</p>
<p>Many have called other users out for circulating the speculations, saying that there are a lot of songs out there with the name ‘Just The Two Of Us’.</p>
<p>One user said: “Omg get a grip, there are SO many songs called just the two of us, why single out an Eminem song thats like 21 years old.”</p>
<p>Another one added: “the people posting eminem lyrics under posts about naya rivera are the absolute worst, this woman is missing and in danger and has a 4 yr old son who needs his mother pls go be a clown somewhere else.”</p>

<p>24 Divers searched for the Glee star but had no luck before nightfall</p>
<p>In a haunting final Instgram post on Tuesday, Naya had shared a photo of herself kissing Josey with the caption: &ldquo;Just the two of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Authorities found the little boy shortly before 5pm on Wednesday at Lake Piru, Southern California, with sources telling TMZ Josey said that his mother had &ldquo;jumped into the water but didn&rsquo;t come back up&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Divers and helicopters immediately started searching the lake but so far there has been no sign of the star.</p>
<p>Naya&rsquo;s life jacket was reportedly still in the boat and Josey was asleep when the vessel was first found.</p>
<p>Josey is now safe with family members. The boy&rsquo;s father is Ryan Dorsey - who Naya divorced in 2018 and stars in the hit crime drama Ray Donovan.</p>
<p>The Ventura County Sheriff’s Department began searching for a presumed drowning victim after responding to a report of a boy left alone on a boat at around 4.48pm, they said in a press release.</p>
<p>They later tweeted: &ldquo;The missing person at Lake Puru has been identified as Naya Rivera, 33, of Los Angeles. SAR operation will continue at first light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Divers searched the lake until nightfall, but were unable to find the actress, who stared in 113 episodes of the hit musical series from 2009 to 2015.</p>
<p>The search is expected to resume after sunrise in the US today.</p>
<p>In an eerie Instagram message less than week ago, the Santana Lopez actress said that &ldquo;tomorrow isn&rsquo;t promised&rdquo; when posting a selfie.</p>
<p>Posing in a simple white shirt with natural make-up, Naya wrote: &ldquo;No matter the year, circumstance, or strife&rsquo;s, every day you&rsquo;re alive is a blessing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make the most of today and every day you are given. Tomorrow is not promised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Distraught fans tweeted for the Sheriff&rsquo;s department to keep looking for Naya.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don’t stop looking for her I beg you,&rdquo; pleaded one user while another said: &ldquo;Y’all need to be out on boats with flashlights!&rdquo;</p>
<p>FOX11 in Los Angeles have reported that Naya&rsquo;s car was found parked close to the boat rental company - with her handbag still inside.</p>
<p>According to reports, the local Sheriff has said that the Glee star is &ldquo;presumed dead&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Lake Piru is one of two lakes in Ventura County that have a total of 42 miles of coastline.</p>
<p>But over the years there have been a number of drownings, making the beautiful lakes as hazardous as the ocean.</p>
<p>The lake holds deep columns of chilly water that can overwhelm people, the LA Times reports.</p>
<p>The cool temperatures, large waves and rip currents can all work in concert to rob even the strongest swimmer of energy.</p>
<p>Lifeguards do patrol a swim area at the lake three days a week, but many of the problems occur outside this small zone.</p>
<p>Strong winds on Lake Piru also often whip up waves that can rock a small boat enough to tip an unsteady fisherman into the water.</p>

<p>Naya Rivera - Star with a troubled past Originally a child star, the 33-year-old actress got her first big break in the US sit-com, The Royal Family - not to be confused with Britain&rsquo;s The Royale Family. The actress landed the role of Hilary Winston in the show at the age of four, starring opposite legendary actor and comic, Redd Foxx. Her next big break didn&rsquo;t come till 2009 when she landed the role of the ice queen cheerleader, Santana Lopez, in Glee. The FOX musical comedy and drama was an instant hit and shot the cast to worldwide fame. In 2017 she was arrested and charged after she allegedly assaulted husband Ryan Dorsey during a row - one month after calling off their divorce. Dorsey, who appears in the Showtime series “Ray Donovan,” claimed that Rivera hit him in the head and lip while they were walking with their child, the network said. The couple divorced in 2018 and shared custody of their son Josey.</p>

<p>In November 2017, Naya was arrested in Kanawha County, West Virginia and charged with domestic battery amid claims she had hit her then-husband Ryan in the head.</p>
<p>Local news station WSAZ-TV reported that the actress had been arrested after she attacked her husband while they were out for a walk.</p>
<p>Ryan is said to have handed over footage of the attack recorded on a mobile phone to police.</p>
<p>The news channel later released footage showing Naya in handcuffs appearing in court.</p>

<p>Shortly after the incident, the actress filed for divorce from her husband; the couple had previously filed for divorce in 2016, but called off the separation in October 2017.</p>
<p>In January 2018, TMZ reported that the domestic battery charge against the actress had been dismissed, after her estranged husband said he didn&rsquo;t want prosecutors to proceed.</p>
<p>Naya married Ryan back in 2014, not long after the breakdown of her engagement to rapper Big Sean.</p>
<p>The couple had previously dated several years earlier.</p>

<p>Naya also dated her disgraced Glee co-star Mark Salling on-and-off for three years before splitting in 2010.</p>
<p>After Salling - who took his own life in 2018 aged 35 - was charged with having child abuse images in 2016, Naya revealed that she always thought there was something more going on with the actor.</p>
<p>She told Entertainment Tonight at the time: &ldquo;He was always just a very dark soul to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always felt like there was something that he was wrestling with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She also said that Salling brutally dumped her following advice from his publicist that being single would help his image.</p>

<p>Naya was originally a child star, shooting to fame aged four in CBS sitcom The Royal Family.</p>
<p>Her next big break was in musical TV series Glee, which had huge success when it aired between 2009 and 2015.</p>
<p>However, the show has been hit with tragedy in the past, with star Cory Monteith found dead in a hotel room aged just 31 in 2013.</p>
<p>Cory&rsquo;s official cause of death is listed as &ldquo;mixed drug toxicity, involving intravenous heroin use combined with the ingestion of alcohol&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s was noted at his inquest that Cory had a history of drug use with intermittent periods of rehabilitation and of abstinence from drugs.</p>
<p>The troubled actor had recently spent time in a rehab clinic for substance addiction prior to his death.

<p>Glee star Naya Rivera is presumed dead after her four-year-old son was found alone in a boat on a lake in Southern California, officials say.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old rented the boat on Wednesday afternoon at Lake Piru, north-west of Los Angeles, the Ventura County Sheriff&rsquo;s office said.</p>
<p>It said efforts to find the actress are now a &ldquo;search and recovery operation&rdquo;. There are no signs of foul play.</p>
<p>Rivera is best known for playing cheerleader Santana Lopez in Glee.</p>
<p>The musical comedy TV series ran on the Fox network from 2009 to 2015.</p>
<p>What is known about the boating incident?</p>
<p>Rivera&rsquo;s child was spotted by another boater three hours after the actress had taken the boat, CBS Los Angeles reports, quoting the sheriff&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>It says the boy told investigators that he and his mother were swimming - but she never got back into the boat.</p>
<p>The missing person was later formally identified as Naya Rivera, a Los Angeles resident.</p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s department said the lake would be closed to the public as the search resumed on Thursday, with dive teams from across the region taking part.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Officer Chris Dyer of the Ventura County Sheriff&rsquo;s office said that authorities would be &ldquo;switching efforts&rdquo; to a search and recovery operation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re presuming that an accident happened, we&rsquo;re presuming that she drowned in the lake,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are no signs of foul play, no signs that anything went wrong, besides a tragic accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over 80 professional search-and-rescue personnel are still actively searching for Rivera, using helicopters, boats, and ground teams, police said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goal is still to bring Ms Rivera home to her family so they can have some closure,&rdquo; Mr Dyer said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Rivera posted on Twitter a picture of herself and her son with a caption &ldquo;just the two of us&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A number of celebrities have called for prayers for the missing actress, including singer Demi Lovato and Harry Shum Jr, who played Mike Chang in Glee.</p>
<p>Another of the show&rsquo;s stars, Heather Morris, wrote in her Instagram story: &ldquo;We need all the prayers we can get to bring our Naya back home to us. We need your love and light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackée Harry, who appeared in the sitcom The Royal Family, posted a clip of her acting alongside Rivera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please God, don&rsquo;t cut this life short,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Who is Naya Rivera?</p>

The Glee actress is presumed dead after her son Josey was found alone aboard a boat they&rsquo;d rented on Lake Piru</p>
<p>Naya Rivera Posted a Touching Photo with Her Son Days Before Disappearance: &lsquo;Just the Two of Us&rsquo;</p>
<p>Naya Rivera&rsquo;s last Instagram post before her disappearance was a photo with her 4-year-old son, Josey Dorsey.</p>
<p>The Glee alumna posted a sweet photo with the boy just two days before she was reported missing following an outing to the local Lake Piru. In the photo, Rivera is seen giving Josey a kiss while lying outside together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;just the two of us,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Rivera rented a pontoon boat on the lake and went swimming in the water with Josey. When the boat became overdue for return after its three-hour rental, the staff at the lake found it at the north side of the water with her sleeping son aboard alone.</p>
<p>A search-and-rescue operation was immediately undertaken at the lake, but she was not found.</p>
<p>According to KNBC, Josey was wearing his lifejacket when he was found asleep on the boat. An adult lifejacket, believed to be the one provided to Rivera, was still on the boat. &ldquo;This is considered to be a horrible accident,&rdquo; a Ventura County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department spokesperson told the outlet, adding that no foul play was suspected.</p>
<p>Rivera is now presumed to be dead, according to authorities, who have shifted their search to a mission to recover her body.</p>
<p>On Thursday, police said Josey, who has since reunited with dad Ryan Dorsey, was in &ldquo;good health.&ldquo;A source in &ldquo;disbelief&rdquo; over the news of Rivera&rsquo;s disappearance told PEOPLE that the boy was always her first priority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her son comes first. That’s apparent in everything she’s posted and done,&rdquo; the source said. &ldquo;Everything is about her son.”</p>
<p>While the search for Rivera is still underway, police &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; if her body will ever be recovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the body is entangled in something underneath the water it may never come up,&rdquo; Ventura County Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Kevin Donoghue said Thursday evening.</p>

<p>Police also told PEOPLE they are &ldquo;confident&rdquo; that Rivera is still in the water.

<p><img src="https://media.popculture.com/2020/07/naya-rivera-getty-20090259-1280x0.jpeg" alt="img">
It has been a few days since Glee actor Naya Rivera disappeared after spending time at Lake Piru with her four-year-son Josey. Her son was seen alone in the boat that they rented together, which prompted authorities to search for Rivera. In light of this tragic news, fans have flocked to one of Rivera&rsquo;s most recent Instagram posts, including one in which she posed with Josey and captioned the photo with, &ldquo;just the two of us.&rdquo; As Pop Crush noted, there is even a majorly tragic connection between that phrase and Eminem&rsquo;s 1997 song &ldquo;Bonnie and Clyde,&rdquo; which chronicles the supposed murder of a young mother who ends up at the &ldquo;bottom of the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While &ldquo;just the two of us&rdquo; is indeed a common phrase, Pop Crush did point out the connection between Rivera&rsquo;s use of it and Eminem&rsquo;s song in light of the news about the Glee star. Eminem raps on the track, &ldquo;Just the two of us. C&rsquo;mon hai-hai, we goin&rsquo; to the beach / Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat / Oh where&rsquo;s mama? She&rsquo;s takin a little nap in the trunk/ Oh that smell (whew!) / Da-da musta runned over a skunk.&rdquo; He continued, &ldquo;Now I know what you&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s kind of late to go swimmin.&rsquo; But you know your mama, she&rsquo;s one of those type of women / That do crazy things, and if she don&rsquo;t get her way, she&rsquo;ll throw a fit. And mama said she wants to show how far she can float. Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake.&rdquo; Now, it&rsquo;s unlikely that Rivera was making the connection to Eminem&rsquo;s song in her caption, but it does serve as a rather tragic coincidence.</p>

<p>Rivera went missing on Wednesday following a trip to Lake Piru with her son. After Josey was seen sleeping alone in the boat that they rented, authorities began to search for Rivera. Josey has since been safely reunited with his father, Rivera&rsquo;s ex-husband, Ryan Dorsey. Unfortunately, they have now classified the search for the actor as a &ldquo;recovery&rdquo; mission. Speculators should note that authorities do not believe that Rivera died by suicide, as some initially speculated. Instead, they think that this was a &ldquo;tragic accident.&rdquo; Sgt. Kevin Donoghue told PEOPLE, &ldquo;We interviewed her son, and there was nothing that we learned from her son that would have suggested that this was suicide. Everything that we&rsquo;ve learned so far leads to this being some sort of water recreational accident.&rdquo; As for what actually happened to Rivera, authorities are unsure as they are still investigating and searching for her at Lake Piru.

<h3 id="naya-rivera-fans-spreads-conspiracy-after-she-tweets-disturbing-eminem-lyrics">&ldquo;Naya Rivera Fans Spreads Conspiracy After She Tweets Disturbing Eminem Lyrics&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://urbanislandz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Naya-Rivera-Eminem.jpg" alt="img">
Naya Rivera’s fans on Twitter are touting a conspiracy after she might’ve reference a disturbing Eminem lyrics.</p>
<p>As recovery operations for Naya Rivera continue, fans believe that her disappearance may have been planned. It has been a harrowing couple days for the Rivera family and Glee fans around the world. The 33-year-old actress was last seen on Wednesday when she rented a boat with her son to take out on Lake Piru in California. When the 3-hour rental period expired but the vessel had not been returned, officials went out on the water and discovered the boat with only the 4-year-old boy asleep.</p>
<p>Josey told officials that his mother had gone swimming but never returned, leading to the belief that she may have drowned. While the child was wearing a life vest, an adult life vest was still present on the boat.</p>
<p>Search, and rescue teams have transitioned their search from that of a missing woman to a recovery operation for her body. The murky water in the lake has made the process slow and difficult. As the wait becomes more anxious, fans have begun to do their own investigative work on Twitter. The last tweet that Rivera posted was a photograph with her son, two days before the tragic event. The intimate picture was captioned “Just the two of us,” and fans have now made a connection to an Eminem song with the same title. The 1997 track disturbingly describes how a father takes his son to a lake and then drowns the child’s mother.</p>

<p>Lake Piru is notorious for having tree branches and other items within its depths that a person could get entangled in. Police have admitted that Rivera’s body may never rise to the surface but that they continue to do all they can to recover it. At the time time of publication, authorities continued their search using underwater sonar equipment and a specialized team of divers to help locate her body.</p>

<p>Are you joking? Now is not the time for conspiracy theories. “Just the two of us” is such a normal and common phrase that everyone uses. Just stop. — ?????? (@mamab3ar__) July 9, 2020</p>

<p>Just a theory on this Naya Rivera situation: Her last caption with her son was titled “just the two of us” Eminem’s song with the same title is a reference to Kim drowning in a lake pic.twitter.com/4MtxMu5qMg — TuttleSZN (@TuttleSzn) July 10, 2020</p>
<p>this Naya Rivera situation ain’t adding up. she goes missing at a lake, 6 days before she tweets that “you never know if you’ll have tomorrow” and the day of her disappearance she makes a caption “just the two of us” which is an eminem song about the sons mom drowning in a lake. — sierra ?

<h3 id="naya-riveras-last-post-has-cryptic-ties-to-eminems-bonnie--clyde-lyrics">&ldquo;Naya Rivera’s Last Post Has Cryptic Ties to Eminem’s ‘Bonnie &amp; Clyde’ Lyrics&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1175833318-e1594299296993.jpg?quality=65&amp;strip=all&amp;w=780" alt="img">
As news spread that Naya Rivera was missing after a boating outing on Lake Piru with her son, the actress’s social media followers turned to her last Instagram post to send prayers and search for answers. Some wondered if the caption of her last post, a photo with her son, had ties to Eminem’s song “’97 Bonnie and Clyde.”</p>
<p>One day before she went missing, Rivera captioned a photo kissing her 4-year-old son Josey, “just the two of us.” While the caption was likely meant to reference the song “Just the Two of Us” by Grover Washington Jr., the line is also a recurring lyric in Eminem’s much darker rap song “’97 Bonnie and Clyde.” The Eminem song narrates the story of a mother being killed and thrown into a lake, and the lyrics are addressed to the mother’s child.</p>
<p>Noting the eerie connection, one user commented on the photo, writing “Yall something is def off and not right. The caption on her last post was a lyric from a song about a mother being found at the bottom of a lake. Then when u scroll a little through her insta u can see posts with captions about gravity pulling her (the post was her sitting in a bathtub with water in it) and keep breathing and appreciate the days u live??” The comment quickly amassed over 800 likes and dozens of additional comments theorizing about potential ties to the song and Rivera’s accident.</p>
<p>While the search continues for Rivera at and around Lake Piru, investigators have not indicated suspicion of foul play. Her son Josey was found sleeping in the boat by himself about 3 hours after they rented it, and told investigators that he and his mother went swimming but she did not get back into the boat. He was found unharmed.</p>
<p>Eminem’s Song ‘Bonnie &amp; Clyde’ Makes Several References to a Mother Swimming &amp; Drowning in a Lake</p>
<p>The very first line of Eminem’s “’97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde” is “Just the two of us,” Rivera’s final Instagram caption before she went missing in Lake Piru. The song seems to tell the macabre story of a father talking to his child about it being “just the two of us” while he kills the child’s mother. Throughout the song, several references are made to the mother going swimming and her body being disposed of in a lake.</p>
<p>At one point, Eminem raps “Now I know what you’re thinkin’, it’s kind of late to go swimmin’ / But you know your mama, she’s one of those type of women / That do crazy things, and if she don’t get her way, she’ll throw a fit.” In another line, he says, “And mama said she wants to show how far she can float.” Yet another cryptically narrates, “Mama’s messy isn’t she? we’ll let her wash off in the water.”</p>
<p>As the search for Naya Rivera continues and authorities presume her to be dead as a “possible drowning victim,” the darkest part of the “Bonnie &amp; Clyde” lyrics being tied to Rivera is the line that references “mommy at the bottom of the lake.”</p>
<p>‘Just the Two of Us’ Is the Title of a Grover Washington Jr. Song</p>
<p>While “just the two of us” is a prominent lyric in the Eminem song, it is much better known as the title of Grover Washington Jr.’s “Just the Two of Us.” Although Rivera’s post does not indicate what song her caption is in reference to (or if it’s in reference to a song lyric at all), it’s very possible that Washington’s is the song she was thinking of as she cuddled her young son.</p>
<p>Washington’s song lyrics take a much more positive tone. In the chorus, he sings “Just the two of us / We can make it if we try / Just the two of us / Just the two of us / Building castles in the sky / Just the two of us / You and I.”</p>
