<p>Environment minister Pohamba Shifeta says poaching instances of high valued and iconic species such as rhino and elephant were reduced significantly.</p>
<p>More than 1 790 suspects were arrested at the end of 2018 up to May this year. He said the arrested suspects doubled than ever before since the launch of the Anti-Poaching Unit in 2016.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this juncture, our appreciation goes to the joint operation between our security forces (NDF, Namibian Police Protection Resources Unit, the Namibia Central Intelligence Service) and anti-poaching unit of the ministry,&rdquo; he said last week.</p>
<p>The Blue Rhino Task Team is after all wildlife criminal syndicates in Namibia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of these syndicates if not all are known and members of those syndicates that are not yet arrested is just a matter of appropriate time and appropriate place, they will be arrested soon or later. Bravo to all our dedicated men and women in these units,&rdquo; Shifeta applauded.</p>
<p>According to Shifeta, wildlife and national parks are the key engines for socio-economic development in Namibia&rsquo;s rural areas.</p>
<p>He commended considerable efforts that were made in the 2019/2020 financial year to maintain and upgrade the standards of infrastructure in the national parks - particularly roads network, fencing, water infrastructure as well as staff housing and park information stations. Shifeta cited progress achieved such as the electrification of a 20km stretch of Waterberg Plateau Park, which is significant for preventing the escape of buffaloes into the surrounding farmlands.</p>
<p>The other is a three-year action plan to construct and upgrade 712km of the 824km fence of the Etosha National Park boundary by the ministry&rsquo;s staff members which was launched and commenced in February. However, he stated due to Covid-19 interruption, only less than 10km has been completed so far but they expect the full work to commence again as soon as the situation normalise.

<h3 id="namibia-dying-for-a-drop--amarikas-troubled-existence-continues">&ldquo;Namibia: Dying for a Drop &hellip; Amarika&rsquo;s Troubled Existence Continues&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png" alt="img">
Every morning Sarti Ndakola wakes up in Amarika knowing she will have to fetch water from the same well in which two of her brothers died after the sand walls collapsed and suffocated them.</p>
<p>Amarika lies 30 kilometres away from the internationally renowned Etosha National Park.</p>
<p>The village, consisting of 85 homesteads, has experienced the shattering pain of loved ones dying while trying to access water.</p>
<p>Between 2000 and 2018, 11 villagers died after falling into the wells or when the walls collapsed while they were collecting water.</p>
<p>In addition, salty, green water from the wells also led to a hepatitis E outbreak earlier this year.</p>
<p>For Ndakola (69) the memory of her brothers&rsquo; deaths in 2008 and 2010 are an ever-present grim reminder of how hard life at the village is.</p>
<p>She told The Namibian last week her two brothers, Pius Kandawu and Johannes Ipinge, used to help her with chores at the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When my first brother died, we did not receive prompt assistance to pull his body out. His body almost stayed in there.&rdquo; Assistance to remove her brother&rsquo;s body finally arrived late at night, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is even more saddening is that our sons died in the same well,&rdquo; Ndakolo said.</p>
<p>Magano Titus (53) told The Namibian she lost her 10-year-old daughter, Anna Tobias, when she fell into a deep well when she was collecting water in 2000.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was blessed with six daughters, but I lost one in those wells,&rdquo; Titus said.</p>
<p>While villagers flirt with death on a daily basis to collect water, a multimillion-dollar solar-powered desalination plant built to serve the village lies idle. It broke down in 2017 and has never been fixed because the Omusati Regional Council does not have the technical capacity to fix it, council spokesperson Simeon Kandjala said in an interview in 2019.</p>
<p>Amarika resident Lea Titus told The Namibian a water tanker, which used to deliver water to the village, no longer does so, because it broke down and has never been repaired.</p>
<p>GRIM REMINDER</p>
<p>These tragic stories are a stark reminder that the most basic of necessities are not available in Amarika.</p>
<p>Also known as Omadhiya, Amarika is home mostly to the San, whose living conditions in Namibia have drawn international attention and condemnation, with persistent claims that they live under conditions that violate their human rights.</p>
<p>Infrastructure like paved roads and electricity are also non-existent in Amarika.</p>
<p>Local authority councillor Johannes Iyambo told The Namibian the problem of safe access to clean water was only reported to him last week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The key to the desalination plant was stolen, and we now need to submit an invoice to the rural water supply at Outapi so that we can open it for them.We brought some water to the primary school, but when we returned, the engine of the truck broke, and it will take some time to fix it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter, however, will be resolved soon,&rdquo; Iyambo said.</p>
<p>In 2006 CuveWaters began a N$200-million project to install two solar-powered desalination plants in collaboration with the country&rsquo;s then Ministry of Agriculture at Amarika and Akutsima, 30 kilometres away.</p>
<p>The plant at Akutsima is still operational.</p>
<p>What makes Amarika&rsquo;s harsh circumstances even more unacceptable is that a desalination plant donated by Germany has not been operational for three years. And from 2010 until 2017 it only worked intermittently.</p>
<p>Since then the plant has only been used to store water delivered by a rural water-supply truck.</p>
<p>But that supply ended when the truck broke down.</p>
<p>Ottilie Andreas, Amarika&rsquo;s head woman since November 2008, said: &ldquo;At the time of my appointment as head woman, we had a borehole to access clean water.</p>
<p>After a few years, we started to experience water cuts during which the water just comes and then goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the borehole is not working, we have no choice other than to dig for underground water.</p>
<p>That is where my people access water for daily use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wells, which are dug by hand, are about five metres deep, and the water is reached by climbing down stairs cut into the sandy, unsupported walls.</p>
<p>Deaths have occurred when the unstable sides of a well would collapse and bury people collecting water.</p>

<p>Others have died when they slipped and fell into a deep well.</p>
<p>Andreas said she has tried to report the matter to Iyambo, but got no response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has given me no concrete</p>
<p>answers,&rdquo; Andreas said.</p>
<p>She wanted to know why the</p>
<p>government was not helping them after three decades of struggling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We feel neglected,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Amon Makaya, who was fetching water at one of the wells, said: &ldquo;The government has neglected us totally. That borehole that was supposed to bring us water only worked for one week and then it was switched off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Makaya said he has resorted to digging his own wells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some holes have green or brown water, others are just dark. But we drink it and cook with it because that is the only water we have.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only good thing provided to us by this government in the past 30 years has been a good network for our [mobile] phones, that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="namibian-tourism-industry-looks-at-domestic-market-to-revive-business-after-covid-19-shutdown">&ldquo;Namibian tourism industry looks at domestic market to revive business after COVID-19 shutdown&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://africa.cgtn.com/wp-content/photo-gallery/2019/06/Loxodonta_africana_MS_10093s.jpg" alt="img">
The Namibian tourism industry, adversely affected by COVID-19 pandemic, is looking at the domestic market to revive.</p>
<p>Tourism activities came to a halt after the Namibian president declared a state of emergency and subsequent lockdown while the national parks closed between April 17 and May 5 as a result.</p>
<p>The Namibian government reopened parks and other leisure business activities in stages two and three of the country’s state of emergency.</p>
<p>Romeo Muyunda, public relations officer in the Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism, said the move is geared towards promoting domestic tourism.</p>
<p>“During the lockdown period, clientele and business declined. We are now encouraging locals to support the tourism sector,” he said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, tourism and hospitality establishments are offering incentives to locals.</p>
<p>Namibia Wildlife Resorts is running special to draw more locals to visit diverse establishments and nature parks, according to Mufaro Nesongano, its manager for corporate communications and online media.</p>
<p>“Since the international visitors are not coming to Namibia due to travel restrictions, local tourism is significant. Hence, it is imperative to grow it, otherwise we end up closing shop,” Nesongano said.</p>
<p>Namibia was a huge market for international tourists, receiving an average of 1.5 million tourist visitors annually, according to the 2018 Tourist Statistical Report. However, restrictions on international travel are a bottleneck to the sector.</p>
<p>Moreover, local enterprises have also united in an online campaign to attract locals to support tourism.</p>
<p>Nrupesh Soni, who runs a tourism establishment, said that players in the sector embarked on an online campaign dubbed “local is lekker” (local is good), which is focused on locals travelling within Namibia.</p>
<p>Through various online platforms, local accommodation establishments and tourism enterprises showcase their exclusive offers to the Namibian community.</p>
<p>“The aim is to enable facilities and ventures to earn an income. To encourage people to participate in domestic tourism to boost trade and commercial exchange by offering special prices and packages,” he said.</p>
<p>“More than 7,000 industry players are participating,” Soni said.</p>
<p>In the interim, besides incentives, the sector is exploring more ways on how to get back in business, according to Bernd Schneider, chairman of the Namibia Tourism Association.</p>
<p>“One alternative is for the broader tourism sector to look to gradually opening up. Also, we need to open up the economy in a controlled manner. We need to start operating, for people to earn an income,” he said.</p>
<p>These include stepping up the recommended sanitation, safety and hygiene measures as well as partnerships.</p>
<p>About 96.5 percent of businesses were adversely affected by COVID-19 and will continue to be affected in the coming months, according to results of a survey conducted by the Namibia Statistics Agency on the effect of COVID-19 on selected businesses in the country.</p>
<p>Namibia has recorded 31 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 17 recoveries as of Saturday morning, Africa CDC data showed

It&rsquo;s like stepping into a parallel universe. The creatures that thrive in the deserts of northern Namibia better belong in fairy tales, and yet here they are.</p>
<p>Everything about the Skeleton Coast and surrounds will undoubtedly leave you spellbound. Lanky giraffes strut their stuff in rivers of sand. Mysterious stone sculptures, fashioned across the landscape by an anonymous artist, pop up unexpectedly. Ancient botanicals (which even have the word “witc”’ incorporated into their name) weave their leaves into paltry soil. Every living being has developed an ingenious desert endurance tool.

MINISTER of environment, forestry and tourism Pohamba Shifeta says 1 790 suspected poachers were arrested between the end of 2018 and May 2020.</p>
<p>The minister disclosed this in the National Assembly on Thursday saying this is a reduction in the poaching of iconic animals such as rhinos and elephants.</p>
<p>He said arrests have doubled since the launch of the anti-poaching unit in 2016.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our appreciation goes to the joint operation of our security forces, NDF special forces, Nampol protection resources unit, the Namibia Central Intelligent Service and the ministry&rsquo;s anti-poaching unit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bravo to all our dedicated men and women in these units,&rdquo; he said.</p>

It broke down in 2017 and has never been fixed because the Omusati Regional Council does not have the technical capacity to fix it, council spokesperson Simeon Kandjala said in an interview in 2019.</p>
<p>Amarika resident Lea Titus told The Namibian a water tanker, which used to deliver water to the village, no longer does so, because it broke down and has never been repaired.</p>
<p>GRIM REMINDER</p>
<p>These tragic stories are a stark reminder that the most basic of necessities are not available in Amarika.</p>
<p>Also known as Omadhiya, Amarika is home mostly to the San, whose living conditions in Namibia have drawn international attention and condemnation, with persistent claims that they live under conditions that violate their human rights.</p>
<p>Infrastructure like paved roads and electricity are also non-existent in Amarika.</p>
<p>Local authority councillor Johannes Iyambo told The Namibian the problem of safe access to clean water was only reported to him last week.</p>
<p>“The key to the desalination plant was stolen, and we now need to submit an invoice to the rural water supply at Outapi so that we can open it for them.We brought some water to the primary school, but when we returned, the engine of the truck broke, and it will take some time to fix it.</p>
<p>“The matter, however, will be resolved soon,” Iyambo said.</p>
<p>In 2006 CuveWaters began a N$200-million project to install two solar-powered desalination plants in collaboration with the country&rsquo;s then Ministry of Agriculture at Amarika and Akutsima, 30 kilometres away.</p>
<p>The plant at Akutsima is still operational.</p>
<p>What makes Amarika&rsquo;s harsh circumstances even more unacceptable is that a desalination plant donated by Germany has not been operational for three years. And from 2010 until 2017 it only worked intermittently.</p>
<p>Since then the plant has only been used to store water delivered by a rural water-supply truck.</p>
<p>But that supply ended when the truck broke down.</p>
<p>Ottilie Andreas, Amarika&rsquo;s head woman since November 2008, said: “At the time of my appointment as head woman, we had a borehole to access clean water.</p>
<p>After a few years, we started to experience water cuts during which the water just comes and then goes.”</p>
<p>“When the borehole is not working, we have no choice other than to dig for underground water.</p>
<p>That is where my people access water for daily use.”</p>
<p>The wells, which are dug by hand, are about five metres deep, and the water is reached by climbing down stairs cut into the sandy, unsupported walls.</p>
<p>Deaths have occurred when the unstable sides of a well would collapse and bury people collecting water.</p>
<p>Others have died when they slipped and fell into a deep well.</p>
<p>Andreas said she has tried to report the matter to Iyambo, but got no response.</p>
<p>“He has given me no concrete</p>
<p>answers,” Andreas said.</p>
<p>She wanted to know why the</p>
<p>government was not helping them after three decades of struggling.</p>
<p>“We feel neglected,” she said.</p>
<p>Amon Makaya, who was fetching water at one of the wells, said: “The government has neglected us totally. That borehole that was supposed to bring us water only worked for one week and then it was switched off.”</p>
<p>Makaya said he has resorted to digging his own wells.</p>
<p>“Some holes have green or brown water, others are just dark. But we drink it and cook with it because that is the only water we have.</p>
<p>“The only good thing provided to us by this government in the past 30 years has been a good network for our [mobile] phones, that&rsquo;s it.”</p>
