<p>Ant McPartlin’s ex-wife Lisa Armstrong confirmed her new relationship on Twitter at the weekend. The Strictly makeup artist retweeted a message from a fan about her beau, adding three blushing emojis. The original tweet read: &ldquo;@lisaAmakeup yes Lisa! He is fit! So chuffed for you, get in!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lisa was pictured outside a café with her new man, James Green, 37, in photos published by The Sun on Saturday. They showed the couple enjoying a stroll through a West London park as well as sitting at an outside café, where James put his arms around the 43-year-old as she smiled and laughed.</p>

<p>Throughout the outing, Lisa was joined by her beloved dog Hurley, the black lab she still shares with Ant. The former couple separated in 2018 after months of speculation and Ant now has a new partner – his former personal assistant Anne-Marie Corbett.</p>
<p>Both he and Lisa have been reluctant to discuss their former relationship publicly but at the time of their separation, the I&rsquo;m a Celebrity co-host released a statement through his spokesperson.</p>
<p>Lisa confirmed her new relationship on social media</p>
<p>It read: &ldquo;Ant is very sad to announce, that after 11 years, he is ending his marriage to Lisa McPartlin. Ant asks for privacy at this difficult time, for both himself, Lisa and their immediate families. No further statement will be made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pair&rsquo;s divorce was finalised in April and shortly afterwards, Lisa liked a tweet which said: &ldquo;@lisaAmakeup feel so sad for you, I know the crazy subconscious feelings you are going through. Being discarded for &lsquo;new supply&rsquo; when you have given your ALL to it &hellip;I think has to be the sorest pain. And when it&rsquo;s only them and you who know the truth. Wait. Patience. Show.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ant McPartlin&rsquo;s ex-wife Lisa Armstrong appeared happier than ever as she was seen enjoying an outdoor date with her rumoured new boyfriend James Green, 37, in London earlier this week, four months after her &lsquo;£31 million&rsquo; divorce from the TV icon.</p>
<p>The make-up artist, 43, put on a cosy display with her handsome companion as they hugged and giggled while taking her beloved Labrador Hurley - who she shares with presenter Ant, 44 - for a walk in a local park.</p>
<p>Former Deuce member Lisa is said to have found love again with her fellow divorcee after officially ending her marriage to the ITV star in April, while he continues his relationship with his former personal assistant and his girlfriend of two years, Anne-Marie Corbett, 43.</p>
<p>The new man in her life: Ant McPartlin&rsquo;s ex-wife Lisa Armstrong appeared happier than ever as she was seen enjoying an outdoor date with her rumoured new boyfriend James Green, 37, in London earlier this week</p>
<p>All over: The makeup artist, 43, and the presenter, 44, finalised their &lsquo;£31 million&rsquo; divorce back in April after their split in January 2018 (pictured on their wedding day in 2015)</p>
<p>Lisa and James engaged in a cosy conversation as they chatted on a bench while sipping on Lucozade and beer respectively.</p>
<p>The duo couldn&rsquo;t take their eyes off each other as they relished in the sunny weather of the capital, alongside her pet pooch, who turned seven in June.</p>
<p>Lisa and her &lsquo;new man&rsquo; coordinated in navy as she opted for a flowy summer dress, while the hunk wore a jacket, a T-shirt and khaki green shorts.</p>
<p>Sporty shoes complemented the pair&rsquo;s outfits, with Lisa sweeping her cropped tresses into a half up half down style and James finishing things off with rounded sunglasses.</p>
<p>In good company: The blonde and her new companion took her beloved Labrador Hurley - who she shares with presenter Ant, 44 - for a walk in a local park</p>
<p>Love life: The TV icon has been dating his former personal assistant Anne-Marie Corbett, 43, for two years (pictured in November 2019)</p>

<p>Happy times: Lisa and James engaged in a cosy conversation as they chatted on a bench while sipping on Lucozade and beer respectively</p>
<p>Over the moon: The duo couldn&rsquo;t take their eyes off each other as they relished in the sunny weather of the English capital, alongside her pet pooch, who turned seven in June</p>
<p>Blossoming relationship: Former Deuce member Lisa is said to have found love again with her fellow divorcee</p>
<p>The blonde is said to have met her reported beau James before lockdown but started seeing him properly once restrictions started to ease.</p>
<p>An onlooker told The Sun: &lsquo;She and James both looked really happy. They were very lovey-dovey — as you are in the early stages of romance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They were chatting intently, holding hands, and she was laughing a lot. They made no effort to disguise their feelings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After the pictures of the couple emerged, a fan wrote to Lisa on Twitter: &lsquo;Yes Lisa! He is fit! So chuffed for you, get in!!!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Getting to know each other: Lisa held onto James&rsquo; hand during their refreshing outing</p>
<p>Helping hand: He was every inch the gentleman as he appeared to button up the former This Morning employee&rsquo;s sleeves, while she puffed on a cigarette</p>
<p>Aw! James fastened the other side of Lisa&rsquo;s garment as they chilled by an outdoor table</p>
<p>Addition? Ant&rsquo;s former long-term partner appeared to showcase a new tattoo on her upper arm, complete with a flower, a name and a date</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s over there? They looked into the distance as Lisa pointed at an object in their eyeline</p>
<p>In their element: The BRIT School alum lit another cigarette before showing James something on her mobile device</p>
<p>They have company: They were later joined by a pigeon who perched on a bench beside them</p>
<p>The head of make-up and hair for Strictly Come Dancing seemed to confirm their relationship as she retweeted the message with her 142,000 followers and added three smiley face emojis. She also liked another tweet from a fan that told her: &lsquo;You f***ing Queen.&rsquo; MailOnline has contacted Lisa&rsquo;s representatives for further comment.</p>
<p>Lisa and Ant finalised their divorce back in April after their split in January 2018 following the presenter&rsquo;s highly documented battle with painkillers and alcohol.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Saturday Night Takeaway host Ant was reported to have handed over £31 million to Lisa, including their £5 million home in West London.</p>
<p>The beauty expert was said to have been the &lsquo;peacemaker&rsquo; during an eight-hour long discussion about her divorce from the TV star, claimed The Sun.</p>
<p>Romantic: They continued to hold hands while Hurley laid on the ground</p>
<p>Animated: At one point, Lisa looked quite stern as she raised her left hand</p>
<p>Going strong: The blonde is said to have met her reported beau James before lockdown but started seeing him properly once restrictions started to ease</p>
<p>Showing the signs: An onlooker claimed &lsquo;she and James both looked really happy. They were very lovey-dovey — as you are in the early stages of romance&rsquo;</p>
<p>Out and about: James looked pensive as he held onto his alcoholic beverage while getting to know Lisa</p>
<p>Like no one is watching! &lsquo;They were chatting intently, holding hands, and she was laughing a lot. They made no effort to disguise their feelings&rsquo;, a source said</p>
<p>The publication first alleged the TV veteran offered up more than half of his estimated £50 million fortune, but was &lsquo;delighted&rsquo; that the case has come to an end as he can &lsquo;move on&rsquo;, two years after announcing their split.</p>
<p>However, as the news broke, the former musician took to Twitter to deny the reports, posting: &lsquo;Nope a load of nonsense AGAIN&hellip;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She went to &lsquo;like&rsquo; tweets that stated: &lsquo;no amount of money could ever compensate for what this poor girl has had to endure&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Get what you can!</p>
<p>&lsquo;You deserve it! Terrible treatment of you since you found out when we did! And with a so called friend! It&rsquo;s heartbreaking behaviour.</p>
<p>Matching: The Oxford native and her &lsquo;new man&rsquo; coordinated in navy as she opted for a flowy summer dress, while the hunk wore a jacket, a T-shirt and khaki green shorts</p>
<p>In common: Sporty shoes complemented the pair&rsquo;s outfits, with Lisa sweeping her cropped tresses into a half up half down style before wearing it loose and James finishing things off with rounded sunglasses</p>
<p>Confident: They enjoyed a stroll across the field, with James holding onto Hurley&rsquo;s dog lead</p>
<p>Sussing him out: Hurley looked up at his owner&rsquo;s new partner as they played games in the park</p>
<p>Dog parents: Lisa and her famous ex were said to be on civil terms earlier this year as they continue to share custody of their pet</p>
<p>Soaking it up: They were enjoying the rare stunning weather in the city as they walked around in public</p>
<p>&lsquo;I bet the money means nothing in some respects, it certainly can&rsquo;t buy the respect she deserves or make up for the sh***y spineless way he scurried off &amp; tried to silence her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whatever the sum is I&rsquo;m sure it will be put to much better use &amp; I wish her all the best&rsquo;; and &lsquo;Why do people care what you get, no amount of money big or small can change the fact a heart was broken&rsquo;. [sic]</p>
<p>At the start of 2020, the former couple were said to be on civil terms, with the exes speaking have &lsquo;without an intermediary&rsquo; as they continue to share custody of their pet Labrador.</p>
<p>Late last year, friends of the former couple told The Mail On Sunday that despite efforts by Ant to keep their split low-key, Lisa still wanted her day in court. She is understood to have felt that Ant &lsquo;got away with a lot&rsquo; following their split.</p>
<p>She was also believed to be dismayed and deeply hurt that he moved on so quickly when he started a new relationship with Anne-Marie.</p>
<p>A source close to the couple said: &lsquo;Ant has been very generous in terms of the financial settlement but Lisa is totally the opposite of someone who is motivated by money.</p>
<p>Moving on: Earlier this year, Saturday Night Takeaway host Ant was reported to have handed over £31 million to Lisa, including their £5 million home in West London</p>
<p>Rumoured: The beauty expert was said to have been the &lsquo;peacemaker&rsquo; during an eight-hour long discussion about her divorce from the TV star</p>
<p>Standing out: The ex-singer, who usually loves switching up her hair colour, added a pop of pazzazz to her appearance with neon green nails</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gotten comfortable! The Call It Love hitmaker sat on the ground while James jogged around with the adorable dog</p>
<p>&lsquo;She doesn&rsquo;t care about that – she earns her own. But she has been so hurt by all of this.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What the general public and his fans don&rsquo;t realise is that Ant&rsquo;s decision to end the marriage came after years of Lisa trying to save him from himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There were at least three years when she was at her wits&rsquo; end and it was tough. Watching him move on was very, very difficult. Lisa is very much aware that a judge may not award her as much as Ant is offering but she doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has suffered tremendously in all of this and she wants her day in court.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Go fetch: The Glow Up: Britain&rsquo;s Next Make-Up Star guest judge threw a ball across the park for Hurley</p>
<p>Out with the old, in with the new: The romance would mark Lisa&rsquo;s first relationship since finalising her divorce</p>
<p>Off she goes: She shielded her eyes from the shade in huge square-framed shades as she exited the park</p>
<p>Impressive career: Aside from her relationship with Ant, the former Cosmopolitan columnist is best known for her her work in TV make-up</p>
<p>In their own bubble: James took the lead as Lisa followed closely behind</p>
<p>Rare break: The former Pick Me make-up supervisor has been keeping with her new romance after admitting she &lsquo;hasn&rsquo;t done anything for months&rsquo; as the nation continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic</p>
<p>Their union legally came to an end during a 30-second hearing in October 2018, finalising over a decade of marriage. He can now marry his &lsquo;rock&rsquo; Anne-Marie.</p>
<p>Ant and Lisa met at a roadshow in Newcastle in the mid-1990s while Lisa was an aspiring pop star in Deuce. He had often spoken of their struggle to have children.</p>
<p>The former Pick Me make-up supervisor has been keeping with her new romance after admitting she &lsquo;hasn&rsquo;t done anything for months&rsquo; as the nation continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Denial: Back in January, Lisa took to Twitter to shut down claims about the details of her divorce from Ant, posting: &lsquo;Nope a load of nonsense AGAIN&hellip;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Supportive fans: The former singer went on to like tweets that stated &lsquo;no amount of money&rsquo; would be compensation for her experience in the months during the proceedings</p>
<p>Lisa said she had had plenty of time on her hands while revealing she even called out her pal Piers Morgan over a live TV make-up gaffe.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Royal Television Society, she explained: &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t done anything for months. People are having to do their own make-up.</p>
<p>Discussing Piers&rsquo; hilarious gaffe, she said: &lsquo;When Piers [Morgan] did his for Good Morning Britain, I texted him and asked: &lsquo;What the hell&rsquo;s happened to you?&rsquo; People are now appreciating what make-up artists do.&rsquo;

<p>James, 37, wore a blue jacket and T-shirt with beige shorts and trainers as he walked along holding Hurley’s lead.</p>
<p>On Twitter, one follower congratulated Lisa, writing: ‘Yes Lisa! He is fit! So chuffed for you, get in!!!’</p>
<p>Appearing to confirm she has found romance, Lisa replied with three smiling emojis.</p>
<p>Back in April Ant closed his TV business Teecourt Limited as he and Lisa settled their divorce.</p>
<p>The couple had married in July 2006 and announced they were divorcing almost 12 years later, in January 2018.</p>
<p>Ant has since moved on with girlfriend Anne-Marie Corbett.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/08/02/01/31460510-0-image-a-11_1596328927614.jpg" alt="img">
Ant McPartlin’s ex-wife Lisa Armstrong has struck up a friendship with a paparazzi photographer, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.</p>
<p>Ms Armstrong, 43, whose divorce was finalised in April, has become close to Ben Benjilali, who regularly sold pictures of the make-up artist and her ITV star husband following their split in 2018.</p>
<p>Despite her previous animosity towards paparazzi, Ms Armstrong last week posted a picture of herself on Instagram wearing a face mask designed by the 41-year-old photographer, accompanied by two kisses.</p>
<p>Ant McPartlin’s ex-wife Lisa Armstrong (left), 43, whose divorce was finalised in April, has become close to Ben Benjilali (right), who regularly sold pictures of the make-up artist and her ITV star husband following their split in 2018</p>
<p>Last night, Mr Benjilali – who has recently scaled back his work as a photographer to devote more time to his mask art – confirmed that he and Ms Armstrong were pals, but insisted: ‘We are just friends.’ Ms Armstrong declined to comment.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the perhaps unlikely union, a source said: ‘This friendship has certainly raised a few eyebrows in the showbiz world. It wasn’t so long ago that Ben was taking pictures of Lisa and Ant.’</p>
<p>Ms Armstrong has made several legal complaints about the behaviour of the paparazzi in recent years.</p>
<p>Ant and Lisa on their wedding day in Buckinghamshire on July 22, 2016</p>
<p>She once posted her own picture of three photographers sitting outside her West London home with the caption: ‘This is my view. #they sitandwait #whatfor #itssoboring #leavemealone #imsickofmyself.’</p>
<p>On his Instagram account, Mr Benjilali showcases his work, including a snap of Ms Armstrong in January arriving for a meeting with her divorce lawyers, accompanied by the message ‘Sunday’s Sun Exclusive’ and pictures of her smiling and waving at the camera when she arrived in Blackpool for a special edition of the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing in November.</p>
<p>Mr Benjilali, who has worked as a paparazzi photographer for more than a decade, also describes how he secured exclusive images of Mr McPartlin arriving at Kingston police station in March 2018 after being involved in a car crash. The Britain’s Got Talent presenter later pleaded guilty to drink-driving and stepped back from TV to deal with addiction problems.</p>
<p>The 44-year-old presenter now lives with Anne-Marie Corbett, who was once the couple’s personal assistant. Paying tribute to her in March, Mr McPartlin said: ‘Anne-Marie is the fundamental reason for the great change in my life. She’s been my rock. She’s a beautiful soul. We’re very happy. I’m in the best place I’ve been in my life.’</p>
<p>A decree absolute, ending his 12-year marriage to Ms Armstrong, was granted in April and, following months of wrangling, he agreed a multi-million-pound divorce deal with Ms Armstrong.

<p>However, Lisa knows exactly what she&rsquo;s talking about due to her years of experience in the industry.</p>
<p>Before she found her calling as a make-up expert, she was one fifth of the pop group Deuce during the 90s.</p>

<p>Lisa recently admitted she &lsquo;hasn&rsquo;t done anything for months&rsquo; as the nation continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Lisa discussed having plenty of time on her hands in lockdown, while revealing she even called out her pal Piers Morgan over his live TV make-up gaffe.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Royal Television Society, Lisa said: &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t done anything for months. People are having to do their own make-up.</p>
<p>Discussing Piers&rsquo; hilarious gaffe, she said: &lsquo;When Piers [Morgan] did his for Good Morning Britain, I texted him and asked: “What the hell’s happened to you?”</p>
<p>&lsquo;People are now appreciating what make-up artists do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The make-up artist has since headed back to work and shared several snaps in various designer inspired face masks.

<h3 id="ant-mcpartlin-and-lisa-armstrongs-rocky-marriage-amid-prescription-drug-abuse">&ldquo;Ant McPartlin and Lisa Armstrong&rsquo;s rocky marriage amid prescription drug abuse&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article22316270.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_BAFTA-TV-Craft-Awards.jpg" alt="img">
On July 22, 2006 Ant McPartlin tied the knot with Lisa Armstrong during a fairytale wedding in Berkshire.</p>
<p>The lovebirds had fallen for each other over a decade before they finally got married at the lavish ceremony surrounded by friends, family and celebrity pals.</p>
<p>The couple had been together for a total of over two decades when Ant announced in 2018 that their marriage had come to an end.</p>
<p>Although the couple split in 2018, it wasn&rsquo;t until 2020 that a staggering divorce settlement was agreed to and Lisa was said to have walked away with an estimated £31 million.</p>
<p>So what happened during the relationship that led to their divorce?</p>
<p>The former childhood sweethearts were the ultimate couple goals at the start of their blossoming romance.</p>

<p>Following his marriage to the Strictly Come Dancing makeup artist, the couple went from strength to strength as they enjoyed married life.</p>
<p>They hoped children would follow, but in 2013 they adopted Labrador Hurley and revealed they had struggled to conceive a baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lisa and I would love to have kids,&rdquo; Ant told Radio Times. &ldquo;We’re trying. It’s tougher than you think when you get a bit older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their marriage was then firmly rocked as Ant began to battle a string of addictions that he struggled with alongside his huge fame.</p>
<p>(Image: Instagram) (Image: Instagram)</p>
<p>In 2015, Ant was prescribed strong painkillers following knee surgery, however he quickly spiralled into addiction throughout the next two years.</p>
<p>In June 2017, Ant checked himself into rehab as he desperately sought help to ease himself off alcohol and painkillers.</p>
<p>Although he left rehab two months later, Ant was still battling with demons and his marriage began to take a serious toll.</p>
<p>At the start of 2018, Ant announced that he was splitting up from Lisa.</p>
<p>(Image: Tim Merry)</p>
<p>A representative for Ant said at the time: &ldquo;In response to the recent speculation in the media, Ant is very sad to announce that, after eleven years, he is ending his marriage to Lisa McPartlin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The television presenter also continued to struggle with his addictions, which eventually led to even more disaster just a few months later.</p>
<p>On March 18 that year, Ant was involved in a horrific drink driving accident that took place shortly after a huge row with Lisa.</p>
<p>At the time it was also revealed that the accident - which saw him arrested on suspicion of drink driving - was his third in as many weeks.</p>
<p>Just six months after announcing his divorce, news of his relationship with PA Anne-Marie Corbett went public.</p>
<p>Shocked at the news, Lisa made no secret of her heartbreak and wrote a string of scathing tweets about the betrayal.</p>
<p>She also claimed that Ant hadn&rsquo;t even given her the heads up that he&rsquo;d moved on with their ex-PA - and Lisa&rsquo;s own friend.</p>
<p>(Image: Twitter)</p>
<p>Anne-Marie had even been responsible for planning Ant and Lisa&rsquo;s tenth wedding anniversary some years earlier.</p>
<p>After a bitter two year divorce dispute, the warring exes finally put their differences aside and came to a settlement.</p>
<p>Ant is reported to have given up over half of his fortune and awarded Lisa up to £31 million.</p>
