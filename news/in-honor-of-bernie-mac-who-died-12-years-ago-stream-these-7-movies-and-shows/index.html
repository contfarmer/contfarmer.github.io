Bernie Mac might have passed away almost a decade ago, but his memory forever remains in his family‚Äôs heart. Here is a look at his beautiful daughter and granddaughter, who both bear a resemblance to him.</p>
<p>Actor and comedian Bernie Mac was known for his excellent delivery of hilarious lines and comic facial expressions. However, his family was also an integral part of his life.</p>

<p>When he passed away in 2008, he left behind his beautiful only child and daughter Je‚ÄôNiece McCullough and his granddaughter Jasmine who was two-years old at the time.</p>
<p>Twelve years after his death, Je‚ÄôNiece and Jasmine have changed, and both somewhat bear a similarity to Bernie Mac in terms of looks. To celebrate National Daughter‚Äôs day, Je‚ÄôNiece shared a picture of herself and Jasmine with the caption:</p>
<p>‚Äú I stay celebrating my favorite person. #nationaldaughtersday2019.‚Äù</p>
<p>Je‚ÄôNiece and her daughter looked fascinating as they hugged and smiled. The smile seems to be a trademark of the family as Bernie Mac also had a similar smile.</p>
<p>For Je‚ÄôNiece, being a mother, a daughter, a friend, a lover, a dreamer, a healer, and a student of life is vital as it helps her figure out who she truly is as time passes.</p>
<p>It seemed somewhat late for him to jump on the train.</p>
<p>Although she hated being referred to as Bernie‚Äôs daughter, Je‚ÄôNiece grew to love the name, and it had nothing to do with her father being famous. She explained:</p>
<p>‚ÄúI feel like it‚Äôs a badge of honor. But it‚Äôs not because my father is famous. It‚Äôs because he is the beginning of me and my ultimate inspiration.‚Äù</p>
<p>Bernie Mac had an outstanding television career throughout his time, although he did not have his own comedy special. He was in the process of putting one together when he died.</p>
<p>The reason for him not having his special as early as others was because when he got to the peak of his career, he was in his 40s, and it seemed somewhat late for him to jump on the train.</p>
<p>Despite not having a comedy special, Bernie had a successful career, and his sitcom, ‚ÄúThe Bernie Mac Show,‚Äù was a long-standing comedy series that endeared itself to the hearts of viewers.</p>
<p>His family, whom he left behind might not have been able to fill the void he left behind, but they have gone on to do incredible things for themselves.

Courtesy of Sharp and Associates PRBernie Mac Show alum Kellita Smith is weighing in on the possibility of an Original Kings of Comedy reunion without the late, great Bernie Mac.</p>
<p>Smith tells ABC Audio that even though Mac was an Original King of Comedy, she would be okay with seeing then rest of the Kings &ndash; including Steve Harvey, Cedric the Entertainer, and D.L. Hughley &ndash; all reunite on tour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always down for greats to continue to be great, you know?&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one man gone, or absent, but I don&rsquo;t think it should impede it&rsquo;s progress. I think all those guys deserve to be showcased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2018, Cedric the Entertainer had revealed that the four comedians &ldquo;were very close&rdquo; to a reunion right before Mac became ill and later passed away unexpectedly in 2008 from pneumonia. Smith says that even though Bernie&rsquo;s gone, his Kings of Comedy slot could be an opportunity for the next generation of comedians to be showcased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe with that slot of his absence, maybe that&rsquo;s a rotating slot&hellip; to bring on someone new, up and coming,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Someone good&hellip;. [like a] Spotlight Showcase segment part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smith says that giving someone else an opportunity to step in would help to continue Mac&rsquo;s legacy as both comedian and mentor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let his name be something. Let his presence be something,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Not to be dormant or to just be ignored. You know, give it homage.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="bernie-macs-character-in-mr-3000-is-statistically-speaking-the-best-brewers-hitter-of-all-time">&ldquo;Bernie Mac‚Äôs character in ‚ÄòMr. 3000‚Äô is (statistically speaking) the best Brewers hitter of all time&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://milwaukeerecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/StanRossBrewers.jpg" alt="img">
Way back in March, Milwaukee Record ran a list of the best Brewers players of all time. Over the course of three articles, a trio of contributors crunched numbers, considered some intangibles, and tried to set aside their personal preferences in order to rank the 50 finest athletes to ever suit up for the Brew Crew. By list‚Äôs end, the incomparable Robin Yount wound up claiming the top spot.</p>
<p>While ‚ÄúThe Kid‚Äù certainly earned the number one nod for his real-life accomplishments, Yount should consider himself lucky that fictional Brewers weren‚Äôt included in our player pool. Had we included actors who were portraying Milwaukee Brewers in movies, his status as the franchise‚Äôs best player ever would‚Äôve certainly been in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Recently, while looking up the lifetime stats of Sam Malone as we watched Cheers, we decided to look into the career numbers of another, more localized fictional baseball player. After a few minutes of digging, we managed to find the fabricated career stat line of Stan Ross, Bernie Mac‚Äôs character in the 2004 sports comedy Mr. 3000. With a premise rooted in Ross‚Äîplayed by the late, great Mac‚Äîreturning to the diamond after a 10-year absence in an effort to cement his Hall Of Fame case, we knew the character was supposed to be very good‚Ä¶and even borderline great. However, we were shocked to see Ross‚Äô numbers were good enough to make him arguably the best hitter in Milwaukee Brewers history.</p>
<p>The statistical support came by way of a Stan Ross baseball card, which was a promotional item for the film. In addition to a image of Mac donning a Brewers uniform on the front of the card, the reverse of the keepsake included a fairly detailed rundown of the stats Ross put up during his 18-plus-year career.</p>
<p>Of course, we already knew he was knocking on the door of the 3,000-hit milestone, but the rest of the veteran first baseman‚Äôs numbers suggest Ross‚Äîthe brash baseballer who called himself ‚Äúone of the greatest hitters alive‚Äù‚Äîwas actually one of the greatest offensive players to ever play.</p>
<p>Before even diving too deep into the actual stats, you‚Äôll notice the card states Ross apparently won three batting titles. The only other Brewers player to win a batting title is Christian Yelich, who earned the honor in both 2018 and 2019. Without spoiling the 16-year-old movie (which has a 55 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes!), the protagonist‚Äôs approximately 3,000 career hits would put Ross behind only Yount‚Äôs 3,142 mark on the team‚Äôs all-time hit list.</p>
<p>In fact, Ross trails Yount (and only Yount) in a few categories. The fictional Ross had an 18.5-season career to Yount‚Äôs 20-year run. During their respective spans, which would‚Äôve overlapped for all but two seasons of Ross‚Äô career, Yount played in just shy of 200 more games. Robin also has about 2,000 more at-bats than Ross did, though their career plate appearances are much closer. Yount also had 30 more doubles than Ross, 52 more triples, and 4,730 total bases to Ross‚Äô second-best team mark of 4,630.</p>
<p>That being said, there are more statistical departments in which Ross would‚Äôve actually been the team‚Äôs all-time leader. And honestly, most of those are more significant the aforementioned categories Yount leads. Ross amassed a team record 2,021 runs (Yount‚Äôs 1,632 runs are the next highest), 2,218 walks (Yount is next with 966), 1,808 RBI (Yount is next with 1,406), 504 stolen bases (topping Paul Molitor‚Äôs 412 and Yount‚Äôs 271), and a career .314 batting average (besting Jeff Cirillo‚Äôs .307 career average).</p>
<p>In 2014, Harvard Sports Analysis Collective‚Äîusing the Stan Ross promotional baseball card as source material‚Äîdug even deeper and determined that, at least numerically speaking, the fake player was a no-doubt Hall Of Fame talent. Their article uses Sabermetrics to lend some statistical support to Ross‚Äô case. HSAC determined Ross had a .466 career on-base percentage (better than Prince Fielder‚Äôs .390 team record), an adjusted OPS+ of 174 (topping Fielder‚Äôs current record mark of 143), and 2,150 runs created (better than Yount‚Äôs team record of 1,655). Most importantly, they determined Stan Ross had a career WAR (Wins Above Replacement) of 105.4, which isn‚Äôt only leaps and bounds ahead of Yount‚Äôs 77.3 career WAR, it‚Äôs the sixth highest WAR in Major League Baseball history.</p>
<p>Even if‚Äîokay, SPOILER ALERT!‚ÄîRoss wound up just shy of the 3,000-hit milestone, he still had a career any player would dream to have. And yes, he had a career every Milwaukee Brewers player would kill to have as well because, according to a baseball card that was probably put together by a marketing intern with limited baseball knowledge, Stan Ross put up good enough numbers to be the best offensive player in team history. Sorry, Robin.

Dee Dee Davis etched her name in the heart of TV fans for her role as Bryanna &ldquo;Baby Girl&rdquo; Hopkins on &ldquo;The Bernie Mac Show.&rdquo; She might not be as popular as she once was, but she&rsquo;s still a beauty to behold.</p>
<p>Dee Dee Davis took to Instagram yesterday to share a video of herself showing off her lovely physique. In a short clip, the actress appeared to have been in a bathroom stall and decided to show off a mirror selfie.</p>

<p>As the clip showed, the 24-year-old actress rocked a red body-fitting blouse with a pair of blue jeans. She showed her classy side with her accessories and opted for a gold necklace and a set of gold bracelets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby Girl&rdquo; now appears to be a big girl. She smiled for the camera as she recorded the short clip, looking just as beautiful as she did when she was much younger in the hit comedy show. While Davis was the star of the clip, she seemed to be drawing attention to her braids. She captioned the post,</p>
<p>&ldquo;‚ù§hair by @braidsbyzayy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Davis&rsquo; hair was a lovely medium braid. It had brown undertones with predominantly black tresses, thus matching her flawless skin perfectly. The look appeared to be a switch in the norm.</p>
<p>Davis tried to keep up with some projects after &ldquo;The Bernie Mac Show&rdquo; got canceled.</p>
<p>Davis&rsquo;s career has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride. While she was immensely popular on &ldquo;The Bernie Mac Show,&rdquo; she hasn&rsquo;t been overly active since its ending in 2006.</p>
<p>The show was a significant cultural phenomenon. It featured comedian Bernie Mac and his wife, Wanda, as they struggled to raise his two nieces ‚Äî including &ldquo;Baby Girl&rdquo; and one nephew.</p>
<p>Sadly, despite the loyal viewership, it got canceled after five seasons on FOX. As expected, every cast member had to move on to something else.</p>
<p>Davis tried to keep up with some projects after &ldquo;The Bernie Mac Show&rdquo; got canceled. She landed a role in the TV series, &ldquo;E.R.&rdquo; However, that didn&rsquo;t last long.</p>
<p>At the same time, she appeared in one episode of &ldquo;Two Degrees,&rdquo; a digital series created by actor Carl Gillard. Her appearance was earlier this year.</p>
<p>However, Davis is still doing pretty well for herself. She is the mother of Logan Anthony Lee Jackson who she gave birth to in 2017. The actress also owns a fashion business for which she models regularly on social media.

<p><img src="https://media.distractify.com/brand-img/73jGZMXA9/0x0/moesha-curse-feature-1596564197643.png" alt="img">
Almost every &rsquo;90s kid remembers the beloved family sitcom Moesha . The series aired from 1996 through 2001 and featured a variety of incredibly popular celebs from the time, including Brandy Norwood, Bernie Mac, and Marcus T. Paulk. And while the show was incredibly wholesome (and seriously binge-worthy!), fans and conspiracy theorists alike believe it cursed the cast and crew who were involved in its production.</p>
<p>What is the Moesha curse and whom has it affected since the show ended in 2001? Scrounge up a four leaf clover and break out your favorite rabbit&rsquo;s foot, because this is seriously spooky.</p>
<p>Why do people think &lsquo;Moesha&rsquo; is cursed? Several cast-members died super young.</p>
<p>In the span of almost two decades since Moesha went off the air, at least four major cast-members have passed away prematurely. Some have brushed it off, believing that it could just be a coincidence, while others err on the side of superstition and have labeled the unusual pattern &ldquo;The Moesha Curse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The list of people who died from the Moesha cast is disturbingly long. According to Amo Mama, the pattern started with the death of Merlin Santana (who played Ohagi). He passed away in 2002 after getting shot six times while leaving a friend&rsquo;s house at the young age of 26. Next, Lamont Bentley (who played Hakeem Campbell) died in a traffic accident in 2005 when he was only 31 years old. Fans of the show were seriously stunned by these two young actors&rsquo; deaths.</p>
<p>Next, the widely beloved Bernie Mac (who played Uncle Bernie) passed away in 2008, after suffering from years of health complications at age 50. Finally, Yvette Wilson (who played Andell Wilkerson), died of cervical cancer 11 years after the show ended in 2012. She was only 48 years old when she passed.

Together with the Chicago Defender Charities, our ABC 7&rsquo;s Bud Billiken special celebrates 91 years of a longstanding summer tradition spanning generations and continuing to celebrate the importance of education,&rdquo; ABC 7 President and General Manager John Idler said.Chicago Defender Charities President and CEO Myiti Sengstacke-Rice said, &ldquo;Even though we will miss the anticipation and excitement that comes when the Bud Billiken Parade marches down the streets of Chicago, we are steadfast in our goal to support education and the performing arts. We are grateful to ABC 7 for making sure that the fun, tradition and spirit of our beloved parade will be carried on through this hour-long special broadcast.&ldquo;The backdrop for BUD BILLIKEN: CELEBRATING 91 YEARS will be at Lindblom Math and Science Academy in Englewood, Burton&rsquo;s alma mater, where &ldquo;blast-from-the-past&rdquo; photos of her high school days will be a highlight.Cameras were rolling to catch the fancy footwork of dance teams competing in the &ldquo;Bringing out the Talent Summer Bling,&rdquo; a dance team competition founded by Shkunna McGee Stewart.

A flashback to all the notable guests of past parades, along with a fresh look from Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson about &ldquo;The Bud&rsquo;s&rdquo; influence on CPS students, will be showcased.Going hand-in hand with the Chicago Defender Charities focus on education, the charities has awarded $1.5 million in Bud Billiken scholarships to outstanding students.
