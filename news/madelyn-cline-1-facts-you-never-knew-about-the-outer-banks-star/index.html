<h3 id="outer-banksstars-chase-stokes--madelyn-cline-sind-ein-paar">&ldquo;&lsquo;Outer Banks&rsquo;Stars: Chase Stokes &amp; Madelyn Cline sind ein Paar&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://shrimp.condenastdigital.de/glamour/_BjiJinRj7uJHw/c_fill,w_500,h_500,q_80/2020/08/89703550b3e8e61e8b716c5c3eab3d29-jpg-5f47b7ce1c61b.jpg" alt="img">
Während sie für die Netflix-Serie &ldquo;Outer Banks&rdquo; ein Liebespaar spielten, hat es auch im echten Leben zwischen Chase Stokes und Madelyn Cline gefunkt. Was viele Fans der beiden Stars schon vermuteten, machten sie nun &ldquo;Instagram-official&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Chase Stokes und Madelyn Cline: &ldquo;Outer Banks&rdquo;-Paar macht Liebesbeziehung öffentlich</p>
<p>Am 15. Juni 2020 postete Chase Stokes auf seinem Instagram-Account ein Bild, auf dem man die Beine zweier Menschen, etwas Essen und den Strand sieht. Ziemlich eindeutig, dass es sich hierbei um ein romantisches Dinner handelt und eines der Beine seins ist. Die Frage, wem das zweite Bein gehört, beantwortet der zweite Schnappschuss. Dort ist seine Kollegin Madelyn Cline zu sehen. Mit einem schüchternen Lächeln im Gesicht ist sie gerade dabei, eine Weinflasche zu öffnen. Was seinen 3,5 Millionen Followern nun längst bewusst ist, macht Chase in seinem Kommentar zu den Bildern noch einmal deutlich: &ldquo;Die Katze ist aus dem Sack!&rdquo; Das rote Herz hinter dem Sprichwort verdeutlicht noch einmal: Die beiden schweben auf Wolke sieben und haben keine Lust mehr, ihre Gefühle füreinander zu verstecken.</p>

<p>Madelyn selbst verzichtet auf ein Liebesgeständnis auf ihrem Instagram-Account, postet in ihren Storys lediglich den Post von Chase. In den Kommentaren unter seinem Beitrag wird sie dafür umso deutlicher. So schreibt sie mit Verweis auf die &ldquo;Outer Banks&rdquo;-Handlung: &ldquo;Topper schlägt in die Luft!&rdquo; Denn in der Serie ist Topper (Austin North) der Ex-Freund von Sarah Cameron (gespielt von Madelyn Cline).</p>
<p>Auch im echten Leben zusammen: Fans und Stars feiern &ldquo;Outer Banks&rdquo;-Paar</p>
<p>Auch die Fans und Kollegen der beiden zeigen sich von der Beziehung begeistert. Fast zwei Millionen Menschen likten das Foto innerhalb kürzester Zeit. Co-Star Jonathan Daviss scherzte: &ldquo;Das wurde aber auch Zeit.&rdquo; Er wusste also seit Längerem von der Beziehung, über die im April 2020 erstmals in der Öffentlichkeit gemunkelt wurde.</p>

<h3 id="how-old-is-the-cast-of-outer-banks-on-netflix">&ldquo;How Old Is the Cast of Outer Banks on Netflix?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/outerbanks-107-unit-03097crc-1588266322.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0601xh&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
Hollywood loves to cast actors well into their 20s and even 30s as high-schoolers, and Netflix&rsquo;s latest teen-centered drama, Outer Banks, is no exception. The show follows two sets of adolescents—the wealthy Kooks and working-class Pogues—as they search for buried treasure in their North Carolina beach town.</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re not channeling the Goonies in their pursuit of loot, these teens partake in summer flings, go boating, and indulge in a beer or two. Each character is said to be around 16, so the latter activity isn&rsquo;t exactly above board. However, the actors who play them are well above legal drinking age. None of the age differences are as egregious as, say, Stockard Channing as Rizzo in Grease (34?!) or any number of the singing &ldquo;teens&rdquo; on Glee. Still, it&rsquo;s interesting to unpack the age gap between the cast of Outer Banks and the characters they play. Ahead, a look at how old the ensemble is today.</p>
<p>Chase Stokes as John B</p>
<p>Age: 27</p>
<p>This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.</p>
<p>Stokes is more than a decade older than his character, the leader of the Pogues. At the end of the first season, John B is on the run with his forbidden lover Sarah. You may recognize Stokes from an appearance on Stranger Things and will next appear on the TNT series Tell Me Your Secrets.</p>
<p>Madelyn Cline as Sarah</p>
<p>Age: 22</p>
<p>This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.</p>
<p>The actress who plays the leader of the Kooks is more than five years older than her onscreen counterpart. In the show, Sarah has a complicated relationship with her father (Charles Esten) and an even more complex love triangle with John B (Stokes) and Topper (Austin North). Cline previously appeared in the Nicole Kidman drama Boy Erased and season 2 of Stranger Things.</p>
<p>Madison Bailey as Kiara</p>
<p>Age: 21</p>

<p>The hippie-lite Kiara, or &ldquo;Kie,&rdquo; is about five years younger than Bailey, who appeared on The CW show Black Lightning.</p>
<p>Jonathan Daviss as Pope</p>
<p>Age: 21</p>
<p>This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.</p>

<p>Age: 21</p>
<p>This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.</p>
<p>JJ, an avid surfer and John B&rsquo;s best friend, is played by a slightly older Pankow, whom you may remember from Netflix&rsquo;s The Politician.</p>
<p>Austin North as Topper</p>
<p>Age: 23</p>
<p>The final third of the John/Sarah/Topper love triangle has a secret heart of gold and nationally-ranked surf skills. He&rsquo;s played by North, who appeared on the Disney Channel series I Didn&rsquo;t Do It.</p>
<p>Drew Starkey as Rafe</p>
<p>Age: TBD</p>
<p>This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.</p>
<p>In some ways, not knowing Starkey&rsquo;s true age checks out. On the show, he plays the mysterious 19-year-old Rafe, a college dropout struggling with drug addiction. You may know him from roles in The Hate U Give and Love, Simon.</p>
<p>Julia Antonelli as Wheezie</p>
<p>Age: 17</p>

<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2020-04-27-at-1-38-24-pm-1588009121.png?crop=1.00xw:0.778xh;0,0.0607xh&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
Watching Outer Banks is the closest I’m gonna get to going on a beach vacation in 2020, and honestly, I’m not mad. One part murder mystery, one part treasure hunt, and one million parts thirsty summer drama, the show follows a group of teens called the Pogues, who are trying to find $400 million worth of gold that’s been ~lost at sea~. Ya know, just normal stuff all high schoolers go through.</p>
<p>As you’re likely well aware because there’s no way you haven’t watched this show yet, the Pogues consists of John B (still have questions about why his name isn’t just John, but whatever), Kiara, Pope, and JJ plus their rich-kid rivals Sarah, Topper, and Rafe—all of whom are supposed to be 16 years old.</p>
<p>The thing is, none of these actors are 16 in real life. Like, they’re not even close.</p>

<p>Age on the show: 16</p>
<p>Age IRL: 27</p>
<p>Yep. Our main floppy-haired man is more than 10 years older than his character. So, like, if you’re wondering why none of the guys in your high school looked like John B, THIS IS WHY.</p>

<p>Age on the show: 16</p>

<p>I mean, she’s at least closer to her character’s age than Chase is, but still. We’re talking about a six-year age difference here.</p>

<h3 id="how-old-is-the-cast-of-outer-banks">&ldquo;How Old is the Cast of &lsquo;Outer Banks&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/outerbanks-cast-bts-00120r-1-1587417075.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.756xh;0,0.0846xh&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
Outer Banks is Netflix&rsquo;s latest YA series that has fans on the edge of their seats as a group of friends go on the ultimate treasure hunting adventure that could leave them living large. However, finding the treasure isn&rsquo;t as easy as it seems and despite the fact that these group of young Pogues can basically get away with everything that they wants since the island looks down on them, they&rsquo;re getting more attention than they ever did thanks to their new hunt. John B., Kie, JJ, and Pope might be totally young on the show, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&rsquo;re also played by actual teens IRL.</p>
<p>Of course, that is the same with most teen TV shows nowadays. Since the days of Gossip Girl, Glee, and 90210, teens on television have been played by actors in their 20s. While this might have something to do with some of the scenes that these actors shoot, it probably has more to do with labor laws that would prevent them from working a certain amount of hours if they were minors. So, in order to complete production as quickly as possible, older cast members are hired to play teenagers.</p>
<p>But just how much older is the cast of Outer Banks? And what age are they trying to play on the show? Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know about the real ages of the cast of Outer Banks.</p>
<p>Chase Stokes as John B.</p>
<p>Netflix</p>
<p>Age: 27</p>
<p>On the show, John B. is a minor as evidenced by child services coming to put him into foster care due to him not having a guardian in his life. This means that Chase Stokes is about 10 years older than his character.</p>
<p>Madelyn Cline as Sarah Cameron</p>
<p>Netflix</p>
<p>Age: 22</p>
<p>This might not be her first Netflix series, but Madelyn is not that much older than her character, Sarah.</p>
<p>Madison Bailey as Kiara &ldquo;Kie&rdquo;</p>
<p>Netflix</p>
<p>Age: 21</p>
<p>Madison is one of the youngest cast members, but she&rsquo;s only one month older than her co-star Jonathan.</p>
<p>Jonathan Daviss as Pope</p>
<p>Netflix</p>
<p>Age: 21</p>
<p>Jonathan just celebrated his 21st birthday and is also the youngest of the cast.</p>
<p>Rudy Pankow as JJ</p>
<p>Netflix</p>
<p>Age: 21</p>
<p>Rudy is about turn 22 in August, but he is still part of the 21-club in the show&rsquo;s group for now.</p>
