<p>Daniel Van Boom/CNET</p>
<p>Friday is worldwide iPhone 12 day, but what does an iPhone launch look like during the coronavirus pandemic? Apple&rsquo;s launch in Sydney, Australia, showed that people are indeed still willing to line up for a new iPhone.</p>
<p>A few dozen people lined up at the Apple Store in Sydney&rsquo;s CBD, fewer than last year, but perhaps more than could be expected in the coronavirus era, by 8 a.m. when the store opens. Jun, the first in line, marked his place at 11:30 p.m. the night before. He bought an iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro and will be back on Nov. 13 when the iPhone 12 Pro Max launches.</p>
<p>As far as world cities go, Sydney is one of the least affected by COVID-19. New South Wales, the state of which Sydney is the capital, has recorded a total of 4,363 cases and 53 deaths. By comparison, New York has had 260,000 cases, London has had 39,400, and Tokyo 29,350.</p>

<p>Customary applause for Sydney’s first iPhone buyers pic.twitter.com/o14OkHAjjE — Daniel Van Boom (@dvanboom) October 22, 2020</p>
<p>Still, Apple has put measures in place to shield Apple Store employees and customers from coronavirus. A temperature check and mask were required to enter Sydney&rsquo;s store, with masks provided on entry for those without. One-on-one sessions with in-store specialists were socially distanced, and customers could wait outside and have their phone delivered to them by an employee if they didn&rsquo;t want to come inside the store.</p>
<p>Jun said he is concerned about coronavirus, but, said he trusted Apple to enforce social distancing in line and in store, gesturing at a customer 1.5 meters behind him.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if Apple Stores in cities more affected by COVID-19 will get a similar turnout. In San Francisco, for example, Apple&rsquo;s Union Square store is open but customer activity is more tightly controlled. Customers can&rsquo;t freely enter and browse. The company books 15-minute &ldquo;check-in windows&rdquo; with customers picking up devices or wanting to shop one-on-one with an Apple Store employee. People save a bar code to the Apple Wallet on their phones and check in at their allotted time at barriers outside the stores. When customers are allowed in, guards takes their temperature and direct them to a table to get help from a store employee.</p>
<p>Daniel Van Boom/CNET</p>
<p>For hardcore Apple fans, queuing for hours (or days) has been a staple of every iPhone launch. Hundreds of people lined up in New York, London and a few other major cities for the very first iPhone. Before long, it became a worldwide phenomenon. September meant new iPhone, and new iPhone meant crowds outside Apple Stores.</p>
<p>Pundits have long predicted the death of the iPhone launch ceremony, especially as online delivery became easier and more efficient. Yet despite diminished numbers &ndash; there were certainly more people at last year&rsquo;s iPhone 11 launch, despite the iPhone 12 being a more substantial upgrade &ndash; Sydney&rsquo;s launch shows Apple diehards are indeed still willing to brave a long night to be part of the fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The experience is good here,&rdquo; said Mitch, who came to the store to pick up his new iPhone before work. &ldquo;Every time I pick up a device here, it&rsquo;s actually so good. They sit you down, everything comes out to you. They walk you through the whole process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro that launch on Friday are two of four models Apple is releasing this year. Coming on Nov. 13 are the iPhone 12 Mini, the iPhone 12 with a smaller display, and the iPhone 12 Pro Max, the iPhone 12 Pro with a bigger display.</p>
<p>The new iPhones come with a slew of improvements, including to the display, which is now OLED in all models and has improved crack protection, processor and cameras. But the biggest jump is 5G capability, which all four phones are equipped with. Due to spotty coverage and limited availability, 5G is still something of a nascent service. But with dramatically increased speed and reduced latency, it promises to be the new standard for mobile internet within a year or two.

<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5ec2413e988ee33da20ea3a3?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
A new iPhone launch is usually synonymous with winding lines at the Apple Store, but the company is implementing some new measures in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Apple will be using a reservation system for stores that are open, should lines begin to form.</p>
<p>That means customers waiting in line may be asked to return at a specified time to make their purchase.</p>
<p>Apple Stores that are temporarily closed will have an Express Storefront setup, where customers can pick up items ordered ahead of time without entering the store.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s iPhone 12 launch is expected to be one of its biggest product releases in years, and the company is preparing for an upgrade &ldquo;supercycle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visit Business Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>If this were any other year, the launch of the iPhone 12 would mean winding lines outside stores around the world as customers wait to become among the first to get their hands on Apple&rsquo;s new devices.</p>
<p>But 2020 isn&rsquo;t like any other year. Apple is launching its new iPhone in the midst of a global pandemic, with many stores closed and the open ones under strict public health guidelines. The experience of visiting your local Apple Store to pick up an iPhone 12 or 12 Pro when they debut on Friday will be very different than years past.</p>
<p>Apple has implemented some new shopping options throughout the pandemic to more easily limit how many shoppers are allowed in stores at a given time, and these will be in effect during an iPhone launch for the first time this year. Apple told Business Insider it is also introducing an in-person reservation system for those waiting in line on iPhone launch day, while upholding the same safety protocols it has been enforcing for months.</p>
<p>If a long line forms outside of stores that are currently open, queued customers may be asked to return during a specified time slot to make their purchase, Apple said.</p>
<p>The company is also offering the option to shop one-on-one with an Apple Store specialist for help navigating the new products, financing options, or carrier plans.</p>
<p>Another measure new to this year&rsquo;s iPhone launch is Apple&rsquo;s Express Storefront. As its name implies, the Express Storefront is a designated area outside the Apple Stores that are temporarily closed because of the pandemic where customers can pick up a product that they&rsquo;ve already ordered online.</p>
<p>The Express Storefront format isn&rsquo;t specific to the iPhone launch; rather, it&rsquo;s a new option for some currently closed stores that Apple began piloting in September, starting with its Burlingame, California, store. The ability to shop with an Apple specialist also isn&rsquo;t specific to launch weekend but is relatively new and has been rolled out over the last few months.</p>
<p>At the same time, Apple will continue implementing the safety protocols and shopping options it&rsquo;s offered over the last few months during the pandemic. These include in-store or curbside pickup and contactless delivery for products ordered ahead of time.</p>
<p>Those who visit the Apple Store will have to wear a face mask in order to enter, and Apple will take contactless temperature checks upon entry. Store occupancy will be limited and social distancing rules will be enforced for locations that are open, the company said.</p>
<p>Apple hasn&rsquo;t said how many of its 271 stores in the United States are currently open or will be open for launch day, but 9to5Mac reports that more than 90 percent of stores in the US are operational as of October 18.</p>
<p>The best way to see what options and services are available at your local Apple Store is to check the website for your specific store through Apple&rsquo;s store locator. That&rsquo;s important because some of the policies can vary by location. The Union Square location in San Francisco, California, for example, is requiring customers to make a reservation in advance to purchase an iPhone 12 on launch day, an employee told Business Insider.</p>
<p>The iPhone 12 is expected to be one of Apple&rsquo;s biggest iPhone launches in years, with some analysts predicting that it could kick off a &ldquo;supercycle&rdquo; of upgrades. The $800 iPhone 12 and $1,000 iPhone 12 Pro are among Apple&rsquo;s first smartphones to support 5G. They also come with a new design, more durable screens, and cameras that are better at seeing in the dark.</p>
<p>Preorders for the iPhone 12 are said to have more than doubled those of the iPhone 11 in its first day of availability, according to estimates from TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, boosted by interest in the iPhone 12 Pro.</p>
<p>The way Apple handles a high-profile product launch like the iPhone 12 is also significant because the company&rsquo;s decisions around how its retail stores operate during the pandemic have sometimes preempted broader COVID-19-related restrictions. The company temporarily closed all of its stores outside of greater China in March, for example, just before stay-at-home orders were issued in parts of the US.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s reputation as a visionary in the retail space and its vast resources suggest the company may set an example for how retailers will navigate product launches throughout the pandemic. Apple&rsquo;s close ties to China — where much of its supply chain is based — have also likely meant that Apple has had an ear to the ground in regards to COVID-19 from the very start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have set the pace for the market,&rdquo; Leslie Hand, vice president of the International Data Corporation&rsquo;s Retail Insights, said to Business Insider in May referring to Apple. &ldquo;I think as we go forward, other retailers will look to make sure they&rsquo;re in the same place.&rdquo;

<p><img src="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/10/Ek-AcplU8AApNjC.jpeg?quality=82&amp;strip=all" alt="img">
As the clock turns to October 23 around the world, the first iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPad Air pre-orders have started arriving to buyers. This also means the new devices are officially becoming available for purchase and pick up at Apple Stores in many countries.</p>
<p>Eager iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro users have taken to Instagram and Twitter to share new pictures of their devices. Both devices are both available in new colors, so we’re eager to see how those new colors look in the real world.</p>
<p>Of course, Apple Stores look a bit different this year for the iPhone 12 launch than in prior years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We’ve previously reported on the various ways Apple has shifted its retail strategy to ensure customer and employee safety this year, including a new Express Storefront pickup concept.</p>
<p>For iPhone 12 launch day this year, Apple Stores are focusing almost exclusively on pickups of previously-placed online orders. As such, many people who pre-ordered their iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Pro for in-store pickup have started seeing their order status change to “Ready for Pickup” in the Apple Store app.</p>
<p>The iPhone 12 is available in five different colors: black, white, Product(RED), green, and blue. The iPhone 12 Pro is available in four different colors: pacific blue, gold, graphite, and silver.</p>
<p>In terms of pricing, the iPhone 12 starts at $829 (or $799 for Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, and AT&amp;T) for 64GB of storage. You can can upgrade to the 128GB configuration for $879 ($849 for Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, and AT&amp;T), or to the 256GB continuation for $979 ($949 for Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, and AT&amp;T).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the iPhone 12 Pro retails for $999 for 128GB of storage, $1099 for 256GB of storage, and $1299 for 512GB of storage.</p>
<p>The iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max will be available for pre-order on November 6, with orders and in-store availability beginning on November 13. Check out a handful of iPhone 12 images below, and let us know when your device arrives, or if you have any stories of your Apple Store experiences, in the comments below.</p>

<p>SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Two of Apple’s latest iPhone 12 models went on sale in China on Friday, after early pre-order data showed strong consumer interest in the 5G-enabled device in the firm’s second-largest market.</p>
<p>The short queues outside Apple stores in the business hub of Shanghai struck a contrast with the crowds that flocked to past launch events, as most ordering has now shifted online.</p>
<p>“I feel great being the first customer to get the new iPhone,” said Yan Bingqing, 30, who arrived before the store opened, and was in a line of about 20 people. “I’ve been waiting a long time.”</p>
<p>A new green shade for the iPhone 12 was also a top trending topic on Chinese app Weibo on Friday, prompting positive reactions.</p>
<p>Apple’s announcement last week initially drew mixed reviews in China, but analysts expect a surge in orders this year, as loyal iPhone owners finally buy new handsets compatible with an upgraded 5G network infrastructure.</p>
<p>Chinese e-commerce retailer JD.com saw pre-orders for all four models of the iPhone 12 hit 1.6 million on the first day of the announcement.</p>
<p>“From the bottom of my heart, it’s a little bit late for Apple to release the 5G iPhone,” said Zhu Lin, another Apple fan who had queued. “I was expecting it last year.”</p>
<p>Apple and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd are the only top phone makers racking up shipment growth in China this year, with an annual rise of 35% for Apple in the second quarter, research firm Canalys says.</p>
<p>Apple’s store launch follows that of Huawei’s Mate 40 flagship device on Thursday, which some in China had said they would wait for before deciding on the iPhone 12.

<p>Apple set Oct. 13 as the date for its latest iPhone&rsquo;s debut, and the day finally arrived. Here&rsquo;s everything Apple announced on Tuesday, including four versions of the iPhone 12 and the $99 HomePod Mini. And here&rsquo;s how to preorder the entire iPhone 12 lineup.</p>
<p>Like Apple&rsquo;s Worldwide Developers Conference and the Apple Watch and iPad launch event earlier this year, the iPhone event took place entirely online, livestreamed on Apple&rsquo;s website. CNET also hosted a live watch party, which you can rewatch above.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s fall product launch this year is expected to touch off a wave of upgrade purchases, analysts say, with fans eyeing the iPhone&rsquo;s new 5G capabilities and boxier look, similar to that of the iPad Pro. A &ldquo;staggering&rdquo; 53% of respondents plan to buy this year&rsquo;s iPhone, according to a survey by . Flashier rivals &ndash; such as Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Z Fold 2, with its foldable display, or Microsoft&rsquo;s Surface Duo, with two screens sandwiched together &ndash; offer new spins on the standard metal-and-glass smartphone construction. But most consumers will likely gravitate toward what they know.</p>

<p>And even if the new iPhone only offers a few new bells and whistles beyond a different exterior design and a new blue color option, it&rsquo;ll draw the lion&rsquo;s share of attention.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s invitation, which often offers clues, had an Apple logo inside circles with hues of blue, orange and red. And there&rsquo;s a pun: &ldquo;Hi, Speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apple</p>
<p>This didn&rsquo;t stop people from speculating about what other mysteries could be hidden in the invite&rsquo;s meaning. Apple was also expected to announce new over-ear headphones during the event, driving some people to ponder whether the circles have to do with audio sounds. (Apple had removed competing headphones from its store ahead of the event.) Alas, the AirPods Studio were not unveiled.</p>
<p>There were also increasing signs that Apple will show off a new HomePod Mini, offering a cheaper take on its $299 smart speaker to more directly compete with Amazon and Google&rsquo;s Nest.</p>
<p>Yes, you can read into Apple event slogans and taglines. &ldquo;Speed&rdquo; is very likely referring to new iPhones.</p>
<p>As for Apple event invite imagery hinting at specific products, that is more up for debate.</p>

<p>Apple also included an augmented reality trick on its website, as it did for last month&rsquo;s event, with circles on the invite turning into floating orbs that reveal the Oct. 13 date.</p>
<p>The new iPhone or iPhones will replace the $799 iPhone 11, the $999 iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max, which started at $1,099 when it launched in 2019.</p>
<p>The prices were expected to largely remain the same, but Apple is expected to upgrade the features, including better cameras, faster chips and the company&rsquo;s newest software, iOS 14. Apple confirmed rumors of an iPhone 12 Mini, possibly as a reaction to some people complaining smartphones are becoming less pocket-friendly.</p>
<p>When Apple jumps into the 5G market, it&rsquo;s expected to immediately become a huge player. This year, Apple likely will ship 50 million 5G iPhones, according to Strategy Analytics, which would make it the second biggest 5G vendor in 2020 &ndash; and that would be in less than three months of sales. By comparison, Samsung shipped more than 6.7 million Galaxy 5G smartphones last year, after its first 5G phones hit the market in May 2019.</p>
<p>Strategy Analytics expects Apple to become the world&rsquo;s biggest 5G phone vendor next year.</p>
<p>A different iPhone launch</p>
<p>Apple hosting its event over the internet isn&rsquo;t the only thing that sets its iPhone announcement apart from those of previous years. The device is also arriving later in the year than it typically does. That&rsquo;s about a month later than typical iPhone launches, something Apple warned about in July when it acknowledged the new smartphones would arrive &ldquo;a few weeks&rdquo; later than normal due to supply issues related to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s announcements also overlap with Amazon&rsquo;s rescheduled Prime Day shopping event, happening today and Wednesday. Typically, Prime Day takes place in July, but this year it was pushed back due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Apple still held its annual September event, though, using it to announce new iPads, a new Apple Watch and its new Apple One subscription service. The service combines its $5-a-month Apple TV Plus, $10-a-month Apple Music, $10-a-month Apple News Plus and $5-a-month Apple Arcade gaming efforts.</p>
<p>Now playing: Watch this: Apple silicon-powered Macs: What to expect</p>
<p>Aside from its new iPhones, there was speculation that today&rsquo;s event would be the first time the company shows off its newest computer, powered by chips the company calls Apple Silicon.</p>
<p>Apple hasn&rsquo;t shared many details about its newest chips, which will replace the Intel processors Apple&rsquo;s relied on for 14 years with processors similar to the ones powering its iPhones, iPads and Apple TVs. Apple said it&rsquo;ll continue to sell Intel-powered computers for now, but the company said the performance improvements, battery life and easier connections with the iPhone and iPad are driving the change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardware and software is fundamental to everything we do,&rdquo; Apple&rsquo;s CEO Tim Cook said when announcing the effort this summer. &ldquo;It will take Mac to the next level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still, people will likely be most interested in the iPhone, and with good reason. Analysts have been increasingly saying they expect this year&rsquo;s upgrade, with its new design and 5G wireless technology, will lead to much higher demand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking a step back we believe iPhone 12 represents the most significant product cycle for Cook &amp; Co. since iPhone 6 in 2014 and will be another defining chapter in the Apple growth story looking ahead despite a softer consumer spending environment,&rdquo; Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note to investors shortly after Apple&rsquo;s announcement went out. Ives said he expects the iPhone 12&rsquo;s launch to be a &ldquo;once in a decade&rdquo; event, with or without the coronavirus.

Now we know what the latest iPhone looks like, we can ask how it compares with its market rival: the Samsung Galaxy S20.</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s virtual iPhone launch - the first of its kind thanks to Covid-19 restrictions - was filled with technical terms and phrases like &ldquo;Lidar&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ultra-Wide Band&rdquo; and &ldquo;nano ceramic crystals&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It announced a £699 iPhone 12 mini, one of four 5G-enabled phones unveiled by the tech giant and the most affordable flagship-series phone the company has announced in several years, alongside the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max.</p>
<p>The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro went on sale on Friday, October 23, while the mini and Pro Max will go on sale on November 6.</p>
<p>Both the Apple and Samsung phones come in various size and price points, so we have compared the standard model iPhone 12 with the Galaxy S20.</p>
<p>iPhone 12 vs Samsung S20 price</p>
<p>Samsung and Apple are neck and neck with the S20&rsquo;s 5G version beginning at £799 compared to the iPhone 12&rsquo;s price of £799.</p>
<p>The iPhone 12 can cost as much as £949 for a model with more storage.

<h3 id="top-five-reasons-to-buy-a-homepod-mini">&ldquo;Top Five Reasons to Buy a HomePod Mini&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/KmNxR5idee5kZAZZlNas0OWrNME=/2500x/https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/hompod_mini_top_5_thumbnail2_feature.jpg" alt="img">
Apple last week introduced a new $99 HomePod mini, which is a more affordable alternative to the full-size HomePod that&rsquo;s been around since 2017. The ‌HomePod mini‌ isn&rsquo;t shipping out until November, but on paper, it sounds great for those who have been eyeing a ‌HomePod‌ but haven&rsquo;t wanted to shell out $299.</p>
<p>Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.</p>
<ol>
<li>$99 Price</li>
</ol>
<p>In our latest YouTube video, we outlined the top five reasons why you might want to buy a ‌HomePod mini‌.</p>
<p>At $99, the ‌HomePod mini‌ is a lot more affordable than the $299 ‌HomePod‌, which was even more expensive ($349) when it first launched. Rumors have suggested that ‌HomePod‌ sales have been weak because of the high price of the device relative to smart speakers from other companies like Amazon and Google, so it was a no brainer for Apple to come up with a cheaper solution.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Intercom</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot easier to justify spending $99 on a home speaker than it is to spend $299, so the ‌HomePod mini‌ will likely be appealing to a wider consumer base than the original ‌HomePod‌. At $99, ‌HomePod‌ is a solid choice if you&rsquo;re looking for a decent speaker that also gives you Siri access and HomeKit control.</p>
<p>With ‌HomePod mini‌ Apple introduced a new Intercom feature that lets you send messages to and from the ‌HomePod‌ and other Apple devices. So, if you put a ‌HomePod mini‌ in oft-used rooms of the house, you can communicate with other family members through the Intercom option.</p>
<p>Parents will be able to do things like call the kids to dinner or make sure they&rsquo;re getting ready for school, and at that $99 price tag, it&rsquo;s more affordable to buy a couple of ‌HomePod‌ minis to place throughout the house.</p>
<p>Intercom messages sent to ‌HomePod‌ are played out loud in the room in your actual voice, and you can send them from any device. You can also send Intercom messages on iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, and even CarPlay.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>HomeKit</li>
</ol>
<p>A ‌HomePod mini‌ is a great way to control HomeKit-connected devices by voice. It&rsquo;s pretty convenient to be able to just say something like &ldquo;Hey ‌Siri‌, turn out the lights in the bedroom&rdquo; at night to turn off the lights, and ‌HomePod mini‌ works with all HomeKit-connected devices.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Stereo Pairing</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s an AirPlay 2 speaker so you can use it in scenes and automations for automatically playing music when desired, plus it serves as a Home Hub to allow you to access all your ‌HomeKit‌ devices when you&rsquo;re away from home.</p>
<p>Two ‌HomePod‌ minis can work together as a stereo pair with left and right channels, serving as audio for an Apple TV or a home theater setup. When paired up, two ‌HomePod‌ minis can create a more immersive sound experience.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Handoff</li>
</ol>
<p>You can pair two full-size HomePods together too, but it&rsquo;s a lot cheaper to buy two ‌HomePod‌ minis than to buy two HomePods.</p>
<p>With handoff functionality, you can bring an ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌ close to your ‌HomePod mini‌ and then the music that&rsquo;s playing on your device will transfer right over to the ‌HomePod mini‌. You can also transfer from ‌HomePod mini‌ to ‌iPhone‌ when you&rsquo;re leaving the house.</p>
<p>Feedback and Launch Date</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a U1 chip that&rsquo;s in the ‌HomePod mini‌ (and not the ‌HomePod‌), and Apple says that this chip will enable a different transfer experience with haptic feedback and personalized listening suggestions.</p>
<p>Have other reasons you&rsquo;re considering a ‌HomePod mini‌? Let us know in the comments below.</p>
<p>‌HomePod mini‌ will be available to pre-order on Friday, November 6, and it will start arriving to customers on Monday, November 16, the official ‌HomePod mini‌ launch date.
