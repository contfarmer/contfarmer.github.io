<p>And how her fans are trying to free her from conservatorship.</p>
<p>Britney Spears&rsquo; recent social media presence has once again sparked discussion among her fans regarding her mental health. Except this time, her fanbase believe that there is a bigger power at play that is controlling her free will. Enter: #FreeBritney. Fuelled by fans on social media, the #FreeBritney campaign has taken the internet by storm. From Paris Hilton to Vera Wang, celebrities are even supporting the musician&rsquo;s right to freedom from the legalities restricting her from living her life how she pleases.</p>
<p>What Is The #FreeBritney Movement?</p>
<p>Although many may not be aware of it, Britney Spears has been held under a conservatorship since 2008, after many public battles with her mental health. The conservatorship she is held under is a legal guardianship appointed by a court, which determines that an individual cannot make their own decisions, due to mental or physical health. In Spears&rsquo; case, her father Jamie Spears, was appointed her financial assets, her estate, and career negotiations. Many have claimed that despite her recent mental health struggles, Spears&rsquo; father has forced her to go on three world tours and is attempting to make the conservatorship permanent, as he believes she suffers from early onset dementia.</p>
<p>Many of Spears&rsquo; fans believe that her father is using this same conservatorship to manipulate and control the pop icon. Particularly, since Spears is worth approximately $85 million. Earlier this year, the arrangement was extended until at least August 22, 2020. With that date coming in a little more than a month, fans are seizing the opportunity to #FreeBritney.</p>
<p>What Spurred The Movement?</p>
<p>Popular podcast Britney&rsquo;s Gram was initially a place for hosts Tess Barker and Barbara Gray to unpack Spears&rsquo; ecclectic Instagram posts , ranging from fairy-tale memes to random painting sessions. However, the pair began worrying about the musician due to the strange nature of her posts, and after they received an anonymous phone call from a member of one of the law firms handling Spear&rsquo;s conservatorship. &ldquo;You guys are on to something,&rdquo; the source told them.</p>
<p>From there, the movement has picked up traction online, with the Instagram account Dirty2000s , releasing a summarised version of the entire situation and urging fans to support the movement. Even supporters of Spears&rsquo; freedom have begun attending rallies outside the courthouse, where her legal proceedings take place.</p>
<p>How Are Her Fans Trying To Help?</p>
<p>More recently, influential celebrities like Paris Hilton and Vera Wang have left comments of support for the musician. Additionally, Spears&rsquo; fans have begun rallying around the musician, as they believe she has been asking for help through cryptic messages in her posts.</p>
<p>Photographer Andrew Gallery, who has worked with Spears in the past, shared information about an intimate letter she allegedly shared with him in 2009 that revealed the truth about her conservatorship and marriage to Kevin Federline. Gallery said he felt compelled to speak up on account of the #FreeBritney movement, and that he couldn&rsquo;t earlier because he was under a contract. He also added that he only had a copy as the original was destroyed by her conservators. In the letter, allegedly written by Spears, she says that she was lied to and set up by her father to take control of her assets and her life.</p>
<p>On July 11, Spears posted on her Instagram account supposedly addressing the recent concerns over her well-being. While she didn&rsquo;t address the movement directly, the post&rsquo;s lack of face-to-face visuals, has led her fans to believe that she wasn&rsquo;t the one who posted it. Her caption reads: &ldquo;I get how some people might not like my posts or even understand them, but this is Me being happy ….. this is Me being authentic and as real as it gets !!!!! I want to inspire people to do the same and just be themselves without pleasing others ….. that&rsquo;s the key to happiness 🌸🌸🌸🌸 !!!!!!&rdquo;

Fans are petitioning to ‘Free Britney’ from her conservatorship (Photo: Getty Images)</p>
<p>Fans of Britney Spears have voiced renewed concern for her wellbeing, sparking a fresh push for the #FreeBritney movement to end her conservatorship.</p>
<p>Toxic hit-maker Britney, 39, has been regularly posting on social media during lockdown, but some fans have commented how her updates seem ‘off,’ claiming she is using them to send secret messages asking for help.</p>
<p>Many have pointed the finger of blame squarely at the conservatorship which Britney has been under for the past 12 years.</p>
<p>The result is a new online petition which has garnered over 134,000 signatures along with the infamous Free Britney hashtag.</p>

<p>What is #FreeBritney?</p>
<p>Free Britney is a fan-driven movement calling for Britney to be ‘freed’ from the conservatorship which controls many aspects of her day-to-day life.</p>
<p>Last year fans protested outside a Los Angeles court during a hearing about the long-running legal arrangement which they believe is a way of controlling and manipulating the star.</p>

<p>They were seen holding signs saying ‘End the conservatorship,’ and ‘Let Britney live out of terror.’</p>
<p>This was also the first time the Free Britney hashtag became a trending topic online.</p>
<p>What is a conservatorship?</p>
<p>A conservatorship is a legal concept of guardianship in America where representatives are appointed following a court ruling that an individual is not capable of making their own decisions.</p>
<p>Usually, it is a course of action reserved for people who are older, vulnerable or suffering from serious mental health issues such as schizophrenia or dementia.</p>
<p>With regards to Britney, her financial and medical affairs are handled by her father and a legal representative.</p>
<p>Her father held power over Britney’s conservatorship for 11 years, managing her financial affairs and daily life since 2008, before he removed himself from the order in September 2019.</p>

<p>Since then, Jodi Montgomery has taken on the role of the pop star’s temporary conservator.</p>
<p>Legal papers filed at a Los Angeles court at the time reportedly stated: ‘[Montgomery] shall have the power to communicate with treating and other expert medical personnel regarding [Britney], and to have access to any and all records regarding [Britney’s] medical treatment, diagnosis and testing.’</p>
<p>Why does Britney have a conservatorship?</p>
<p>Britney was first placed under a conservatorship in 2008 after suffering a series of mental breakdowns requiring medical intervention.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the arrangement was extended until at least 22 August when it is set to be reviewed again.</p>
<p>With this date fast approaching, it has served as the impetus for the current #FreeBritney movement.</p>
<p>Does Britney have any control over her life?</p>
<p>While the legal constraints of her conservatorship suggest she has little control over her life, a lawyer for Britney insisted last year that this was not the case, saying: ‘She’s always involved in every career and business decision. Period.’</p>
<p>Britney herself appeared to confirm this by telling fans on social media: ‘You may not know this about me but I am strong, and stand up for what I want!’</p>

Britney Spears&rsquo; recent social media posts have once again sparked discussion among her fans on the singer&rsquo;s mental health. Concerned with her posts, several of her fans on Instagram observed that she was not behaving normally and wrote, “Girl you okay? Love you + your work but you seem.. off” and “Britney we all love you. we want you to be ok!”</p>
<p>Fans have started the hashtag #FreeBritney, a trend that first came into existence in 2019 after Spears was checked into mental health facility after she refused to take prescribed drugs that her doctor had given her and for driving to an In-N-Out with her boyfriend.</p>
<p>Several of her followers have again started conversing about Britney&rsquo;s conservatorship, under which her assets and life is controlled and monitored by her father and her lawyer.</p>
<p>The hashtags #SaveBritney and #FreeBritney have once again started trending on social media with many fans believing that Britney was sending them secret messages to rescue her and get her out of her conservatorship.</p>
<p>A conservatorship is a legal concept of guardianship in America, where an individual is appointed a guardian or a conservator by the court to help them with their day to day affairs. Such an arrangement is made for mentally or physically incapable individuals or for senior citizens or people suffering from extreme mental health issues, like schizophrenia or dementia. The conservator makes all the decisions in their life.</p>
<p>In Britney’s case, her estate, financial assets, visitors and career negotiations are being overlooked by her father, Jamie Spears and an attorney.</p>
<p>After her break up with her husband Kevin Federline in 2007, the singer underwent a very public meltdown and even shaved her head. Since then the singer has been under conservatorship.</p>
<p>In 2008, the singer was committed to a psychiatric ward twice and after the second time, her father petitioned with the Los Angeles County Superior Court for an emergency “temporary conservatorship.” The arrangement was later made permanent.</p>
<p>Since then Britney&rsquo;s life and career has been completely owned and controlled by her father. The singer does not have any right to spend her own money, and all her activities are monitored.</p>
<p>Fans argue that if Britney was mentally unwell, she wouldn&rsquo;t have had a thriving career and released 4 albums, and earned over USD 138 million since the time she was put in conservatorship. Fans believe that her conservatorship is just a means to exploit her and her wealth which according to court documents from 2018 is at least $59 million.</p>
<p>Over 134,000 concerned fans have now signed a petition asking for Spears to get her own lawyer and finally get out of the conservatorship.</p>
<p>Fashion industry watchdog, Diet Prada, took to their Instagram and shared about the whole episode and pointed out why it was important for Britney Spears to break free. &ldquo;This is heartbreaking. Swipe to slide 5 for the shady details on Britney’s conservatorship, which is usually reserved for individuals who are incapacitated. I know some people’s instincts might be to not take this seriously or laugh because the world has made a joke of her existence to a certain extent, but this is a woman who is denied access to her own children, finances, and any control over her own life. The law is corrupt and so are the middle-aged men who are ruining a thriving, successful woman’s life. Britney has a court hearing coming up on July 22nd. Check our stories for a swipe up of actionable items you can do to help #FreeBritney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spears was a Mickey Mouse club star that also featured Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera. The singer&rsquo;s pop debut was in 1999 and her first album &lsquo;Baby One More Time&rsquo; was a smash hit.

<h3 id="freebritney-perché-si-torna-a-parlare-del-movimento-per-salvare-britney-spears">&ldquo;#FreeBritney, perché si torna a parlare del movimento per salvare Britney Spears&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.wired.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/15130258/GettyImages-1157263385-1.jpg" alt="img">
Sono anni che i fan della cantante sono preoccupati per la sua salute e per gli effetti che la tutela legale del padre ha su di lei. Una nuova lettera infiamma i commenti sui social network</p>
<p>Sta tornando in queste ore alla ribalta l’hashtag #FreeBritney che identifica sui social network il movimento di fan preoccupati per la salute mentale della cantante Britney Spears. Il caso, in particolare, si è riacceso in questi giorni dopo che Andrew Gallery, un fotografo che aveva collaborato con la popstar nel 2008 ai tempi del suo ritorno sulle scene dopo una grave crisi nervosa che l’aveva caratterizzata l’anno prima, ha letto su TikTok una lettera che lei stessa gli avrebbe affidato all’epoca: scritta in terza persona e copiata da un’altra mano perché l’originale sarebbe andato distrutto, la missiva sembra avvalorare i sospetti più volte esternati dai sostenitori di Spears: che la ragazza, cioè, sia manipolata e controllata dalla sua famiglia, in particolare dal padre James Parnell. Nelle scorse ore anche il popolare account Diet Prada, celebre per stanare gli scandali di brand di moda e celebrità, ha realizzato un lungo e articolato post sottolineando la situazione critica.</p>
<p>Dopo il breakdown del 2007, Spears era stata messa sotto la tutela legale del padre e dell’avvocato Andrew Wallet, i quali deciderebbero per lei qualsiasi cosa, supervisionando persino il suo uso del telefono, le decisioni in fatto di soldi, cibo, amicizie, spostamenti e molto altro ancora. Passata quell’emergenza psichiatrica, la curatela è stata prolungata più volte, tanto da essere ancora in corso. Nel frattempo i fan notano comportamenti sempre più strani nelle rare esternazioni pubbliche della cantante, soprattutto via social media, come durante la quarantena nei diversi video in cui aveva montato sue sfilate e coreografie casalinghe su varie musiche. Nel 2019 Spears è stata anche ricoverata in una struttura psichiatrica, in seguito a un periodo di particolare stress lavorativo ma anche dopo una fase in cui sembrava aver ritrovato il successo di un tempo, grazie all’album Glory e a una residency a Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Da qualche anno a questa parte il movimento #FreeBritney torna a far parlare di sé in varie ondate, organizzando anche proteste fuori dei tribunali in cui si decide periodicamente il prolungamento della tutela da parte del padre James (che nel 2019 è stato accusato di aver percosso il nipote Sean Preston, con conseguente riduzione della custodia di Britney Spears sui propri figli). È difficile comprendere dove stia la verità nelle varie ricostruzioni dei fatti, e anche la lettera citata da Gallery suscita alcuni dubbi soprattutto sulle tempistiche con cui è stata resa pubblica (il fotografo sostiene di non aver parlato prima perché “sotto contratto“). Negli scorsi mesi numerose celebrità, fra cui Miley Cyrus e Rose McGowan, hanno sostenuto a loro volta il #FreeBritney e sembra esserci una preoccupazione crescente nei confronti di questa star che ha pagato e forse sta ancora pagando a caro prezzo la fama debordante che l’ha investita a partire dagli anni Novanta.

<h3 id="freebritney-appello-dei-fan-per-liberare-britney-spears-dal-padre">&ldquo;#FreeBritney, appello dei fan per “liberare Britney Spears dal padre”&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.sky.it/images/skytg24/it/spettacolo/musica/2020/07/15/britney-spears-freebritney-appello/0-britney-Getty.jpg" alt="img">
Sui social ha preso corpo un hashtag lanciato dai supporter della cantante, che chiedono la “liberazione” della popstar dalla tutela legale del padre cui è sottoposta dal 2008, dopo aver avuto un crollo psicologico. Indiscrezioni di stampa rivelano che l’uomo starebbe usando un forte controllo sulla vita della figlia. Al movimento ha aderito anche Chiara Ferragni</p>
<p>I fan di Britney Spears chiedono la “liberazione” della cantante dal padre. Con un hashtag lanciato sui social, diventato in fretta virale, migliaia di persone hanno aderito all’appello #FreeBritney. I supporter della popstar vorrebbero svincolare la popstar dalla tutela legale del padre cui è sottoposta dal 2008, dopo aver avuto un forte crollo psicologico (COME È CAMBIATA NEGLI ANNI). Al movimento ha aderito anche Chiara Ferragni, che ha condiviso un post in cui viene spiegato quello che sta succedendo tra le sue storie di Instagram.</p>
<p>I fan contro il padre di Britney leggi anche Pride, Britney Spears alla comunità LGBTQ+: &ldquo;Siete voi a tirarmi su&rdquo; Secondo indiscrezioni pubblicate dai giornali Usa, Jamie Spears, papà di Britney, avrebbe tenuto negli anni un pressante controllo sulla vita della figlia e starebbe controllando la sua carriera e la sua vita privata. Inoltre ora sarebbe sul punto di chiedere al tribunale della California una proroga del suo ruolo, nonostante l’ormai completo recupero psicologico della cantante. Il mantenimento del ruolo nella “conservatorship” consente all’uomo di essere anche il tutore del patrimonio e quindi avere un sistematico controllo su ogni aspetto economico, lavorativo e sociale della quotidianità della figlia.

<p><img src="https://images2.corriereobjects.it/methode_image/socialshare/2020/07/15/1f45bd08-c673-11ea-a52c-6b2a448f1d2c.jpg" alt="img">
L’ultima ad unirsi all’appello è stata Chiara Ferragni, l’imprenditrice digitale che nelle ultime ore ha ripostato la vicenda nelle sue Stories di Instagram. Ma la campagna #FreeBritney, lanciata dai suoi fans a sostegno di Britney Spears, in realtà risale all’anno scorso quando la cantante era stata ricoverata in un istituto di salute mentale. La spiegazione ufficiale, confermata dalle riviste di gossip americane, era semplice: la 38enne avrebbe dovuto curarsi dallo stress provocato dalla grave malattia del padre Jamie, sottoposto a diversi interventi per problemi all’intestino e al colon.</p>
<p>Ma subito dopo ha iniziato a circolare un’altra spiegazione, del tutto ufficiosa: che la giovane era sì stata ricoverata ma contro la sua volontà (e forse costretta dal padre). La cantante stessa aveva smentito con un breve video su Instagram, ma i fan hanno iniziato ad organizzarsi per aiutarla. C’è chi ha lanciato degli appelli online e chi è addirittura sceso in piazza. Da qui nasce l’hashtag #FreeBritney, in italiano «Liberate Britney».</p>
<p>A sostegno di questa ipotesi c’è la decisione del suo legale, che data del marzo 2019, di confermare a Jamie Spears la tutela sulla figlia. Tutela ottenuta nel 2008 durante l’«anno nero» della cantante e legata anche al controllo del suo patrimonio. E’ proprio questo il nodo cruciale secondo molti fan, che vedono nella tutela del padre solo uno strumento per mettere le mani sui soldi di Britney Spears. Ipotesi avvalorata anche dalle dichiarazioni della madre Lynne, che dopo aver divorziato da Jamie ha detto che lui non sarebbe più in grado di seguire la figlia (ma molti fan si sono insospettiti: che quella interessata al patrimonio sia soprattutto lei?).

<p>Los fans de Britney Spears están creando el movimiento viral #FreeBrirtney. Estamos viendo videos donde la voz de la cantante es mucho más grave y distinta a lo que hemos escuchado durante décadas en sus canciones. Además de múltiples publicaciones con el hashtag anterior y una petición para liberar a Britney. Hasta celebridades como Miley Cyrus han expresado su preocupación por la intérprete.</p>
<p>Aquí todo lo que debes saber sobre lo que está pasando con el icono de los noventas.</p>
<p>#FreeBritney</p>
<p>Publicidad</p>
<p>Es un esfuerzo por liberar el icono pop de una custodia legal y permitirle ser la única que toma decisiones sobre su vida y sus finanzas. Esta tutela fue implementada en 2008 por el padre de la cantante, Jamie Spears, quien ha tenido el control de ella desde entonces, alegando que ella no está bien de sus facultades mentales.</p>
<p>Spears, de 38 años, ha estado bajo tutela después de sufrir varias crisis. Básicamente el arreglo establece que tiene que pedirle autorización a su padre para hacer lo más mínimo. No puede salir de su casa, votar, usar un celular no monitoreado, manejar su coche, gastar su propio dinero, saber cómo gastan su dinero, hablar de la custodia en público, dar entrevistas que no tengan guión, además que le quitaron la custodia de sus hijos.</p>
<p>El arreglo siempre ha sido polémico entre los fans de Spears, quienes creen que se está utilizando para manipularla y controlarla. Spears vale al menos 59 millones de dólares, según los documentos judiciales presentados en 2018. Y todo esto, es administrado por su padre.</p>
<p>¿Qué es una guardia legal?</p>
<p>Es una tutela legal en la que se pueden nombrar representantes cuando un tribunal está de acuerdo en que un individuo no puede tomar sus propias decisiones. En este caso, los activos financieros de Spears, su patrimonio y las negociaciones de carrera se están gestionando entre su padre, Jamie Spears, y un abogado. Incluso los visitantes pueden ser restringidos.</p>
<p>A principios de este año, el acuerdo se prorrogó al menos hasta el 22 de agosto. Con esa fecha llegando en poco más de un mes, los fans están aprovechando la oportunidad de #FreeBritney. Hay múltiples cuentas publicando información y también una petición.</p>
<p>Explotación de su imagen</p>
<p>Los fans y seguidores de este movimiento encuentran incongruente que nombren incapaz a Britney de tomar decisiones y básicamente, de vivir independientemente, pero que consideren que sí puede trabajar. Desde el arreglo legal donde no puede ni salir de casa, han lanzado cuatro discos de la cantante, ha hecho tres tours mundiales, hizo la residencia en Las Vegas durante cuatro años, lanzó colecciones de perfumes y lencería, y hasta fue juez en The X Factor.</p>
<p>In case you still haven’t heard about the #FreeBritney movement, here’s everything you need to know. Whether you’re a Britney fan or not this is a violation of her basic human rights. pic.twitter.com/qESj3qVIX8 — Saint Hoax (@SaintHoax) July 14, 2020</p>
<p>Aproximan que ha ganado 130 millones de dólares al año. De lo cual no puede tocar nada. Así los fans creen que la custodia sirve para explotar a la cantante, mientras no se le permite hacer nada fuera de lo gestionado por su padre. Tampoco puede contratar ni despedir a nadie de su equipo. No tiene voz en ningún aspecto profesional, ni personal.</p>
<p>Cambio de voz</p>
<p>Otra parte de #FreeBritney es que los fans tienen videos para creer que nunca le han permitido a Britney cantar con su verdadero tono de voz. Se cree que tiene una voz mucho más grave, pero que los productores y la disquera pensaron que ese tono de voz de niña sería más icónico y representativo para hacer una marca.</p>
<p>Alegan que en 2006 estaba lista para lanzar un disco para reinventar su voz. Pero tumbaron el proyecto. Así que ahora con esta campaña han hecho recopilaciones de videos que muestran cómo era la voz de Britney antes.
