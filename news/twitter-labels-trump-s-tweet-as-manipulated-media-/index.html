<p>Twitter Inc added a ‘manipulated media’ label on a video posted on U.S. President Donald Trump’s Twitter feed on Thursday that showed a doctored news clip with a mis-spelled banner flashing “Terrified todler runs from racist baby.”</p>
<p>The original video, which went viral on social media in 2019, showed a black toddler and a white toddler running towards each other and hugging. It was published <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/10/us/new-york-toddlers-hugging-trnd/index.html">https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/10/us/new-york-toddlers-hugging-trnd/index.html</a> with the headline “These two toddlers are showing us what real-life besties look like” on CNN’s website last year.</p>

<h3 id="how-trustworthy-and-far-reaching-is-twitters-flagging-of-potus-trumps-posts">&ldquo;How Trustworthy and Far-Reaching Is Twitter’s Flagging of POTUS Trump’s Posts?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn1.img.sputniknews.com/images/107965/81/1079658172.jpg" alt="img">
The social media giant has flagged yet another post by Donald Trump as &ldquo;manipulated media” sparking debate on whether this move and a series of similar others have clear-cut political undertones in them, as well as if it is indeed &ldquo;censorship&rdquo;, which would have long-lasting impact on the US political and social life.</p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s recent move to inform the general public that another presidential tweet is ostensibly propaganda has led many to see the move as part of the ongoing tussle between Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p>The partisan “gang war” is responsible for that kind of &ldquo;grey&rdquo; social media censorship, says Denis Rancourt, a researcher at the Ontario Civil Liberties Association.</p>
<p>“The twitter censorship and grey-deplatforming of Trump are a demonstration that both common sense and the US constitution are being increasingly eroded by partisan fighting,” he argues, stressing that the same historically inherent battle also makes US foreign policy and &ldquo;illegal violations of national sovereignties&rdquo; chaotic and irresponsible.</p>
<p>Noting that freedom of expression “is hanging by a thread” in the US, the commentator remarks that “the scissors” are also there, emerging time and again. In light of increased reports about partisan censorship and the pendulum tilted towards mainstream media and stories favouring the Democrats, Rancourt believes it is getting more and more difficult “to think of the USA as a democracy, as opposed to a propaganda show.”</p>
<p>In this connection, he points to the division of the media field into two global - but distinctly uneven - spheres of influence:</p>
<p>“The Republicans still have cable TV, some penetration on social media, and a few mainstream stars such as Tucker Carlson, but, otherwise, it is a Democrat mind field constantly fertilised by a designed and NGO-aligned educational curriculum,” the academic notes.</p>
<p>For others, the political undertones underlying Twitter&rsquo;s action do not seem that evident.</p>
<p>Kevin Curran, professor of Cyber Security as the School of Computing, Engineering and Intelligent System, Ulster University, says he doesn’t know exactly to what extent Twitter’s move was political.</p>
<p>“I can see how the Trump administration feel that the president is personally subject to much higher scrutiny than others,&rdquo; he says, admitting that the president has fair grounds to claim other opponents &ldquo;do not experience the same judgement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of shadow-banning of certain accounts by Twitter, he says the trustworthiness of the moves fully depends on who exactly is technically responsible for them.</p>
<p>Whether or not such labelling is trustworthy “is directly proportional to the size of the team involved and indeed the collective intelligence of that group.” The team will likely have some cultural and political leanings, so a technical feature overseen by the team “is always going to fall short of perceived fairness”, the commentator says citing an omnipresent human bias.</p>
<p>However, he doubts that such flagging could have a serious lasting effect on people’s way of thinking, including in the run-up to the presidential vote, as the electorate would hardly pay any significant attention to any technical flagging of something they genuinely believe in.</p>
<p>“People on social media will keep seeing stories which reflect their internal viewpoint. Very few people change. I think social media will have little impact on elections,” Curran sums up.</p>
<p>The other day, Twitter marked yet another tweet by President Trump - for the third time in the past month - as &ldquo;manipulated media”. In the post, Trump shared a fake CNN clip with two toddlers , one black and the other one white, running in the street, to the sounds of an ominous jingle and a CNN-style caption reading “terrified todler[sic] runs from racist baby.”</p>
<p>Then, in a quite an unexpected twist, the video shows the pair hugging and having fun, rounding off with the verdict: ”America isn&rsquo;t the problem. Fake news is. If you see something, say something.”</p>
<p>Facebook and Twitter have since removed the so-called &ldquo;racist baby&rdquo; video citing a copyright claim by one of the parents of a toddler shown the video. Tensions between Trump and social media have generally been on the rise of late, with his posts increasingly scrutinised and flagged - something that prompted him to blatantly refer to social media as platforms controlled by the &ldquo;Radical Left&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Twitter previously labelled Trump&rsquo;s tweets on the George Floyd protests that used the line &ldquo;when the looting starts, the shooting starts&rdquo;, as well as his outspoken remarks on mail-in voting strongly endorsed by the Democrats. Hardly had the backlash eased off, when Twitter removed a Trump campaign video &lsquo;tribute&rsquo; to George Floyd that denounced aggressive protesters, who have committed acts of vandalism in recent weeks, and praised peaceful demonstrations.</p>
<p>Facebook then removed a Trump campaign ad that displayed a red triangle, after pointing out that the symbol was widely used in 20th century Nazi concentration camps.</p>
<p>A Trump spokesperson stated that the triangle was nothing more than an emoji while claiming, falsely though, that the symbol had been used by the Antifa, a loosely organised left-wing group. The conflict over the repeated labelling of his personal tweets has now led POTUS to announce that he would introduce a new executive order that would facilitate filing lawsuits against social media platforms.</p>

<h3 id="why-twitter-labeled-trumps-tweets-as-misleading-and-facebook-didnt">&ldquo;Why Twitter labeled Trump’s tweets as misleading and Facebook didn’t&rdquo;</h3>

The Interface is a daily column and newsletter about the intersection of social media and democracy. Subscribe here .</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Oh boy, there’s an executive order! About social media! And also the entire internet! And the president signed it, reports Chris Megerian at the Los Angeles Times:</p>
<p>The order directs Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to request new regulations from the Federal Communications Commission to determine whether a social media company is acting “in good faith” to moderate content. In theory, that could open the door to users suing social media platforms if they feel their posts are restricted inappropriately. But it could also make the companies more likely to take down false or misleading content rather that just add a disclaimer — the opposite of what Trump wants. “That’s the irony of all this,” said Nathaniel Persily, a Stanford University law professor who studies technology and democracy. “The platforms will be much more aggressive in their automated filtering to go after content that could raise their legal liability.”</p>
<p>An executive order like this had first been proposed last August, after the White House invited ordinary Americans to share stories about times when they felt they had been unfairly censored by social networks. According to Issie Lapowsky and Emily Birnbaum at Protocol, Trump ordered that his staff “do something” about Twitter labeling his tweets, and so “they picked this [order] off the shelf and essentially rammed it through,” according to an unnamed official.</p>
<p>As to the merits of the president’s complaint: independent audits have found that social media posts by liberals and conservatives get similar levels of engagement, but conservatives have consistently made claims of discrimination anyway based on anecdotes. Even as Fox News consistently gets more engagement on Facebook than almost any other publisher, conservatives have come to define “bias” ever downward — so that it now covers any outcome they don’t like, whether it’s poor placement in search results, the removal of bot followers, or fact-checking.</p>
<p>That has led an increasing number of conservatives to sue social networks alleging infringements on their rights. What these cases have in common is that courts keep throwing them out, as Adi Robertson reported this week in The Verge, in a piece that surveys a large handful of recent attempts.</p>
<p>Interestingly, to the extent that there’s a nexus between Twitter and the First Amendment, courts have found that it is found when the president blocks users — a practice they have found to be unconstitutional, Robertson writes:</p>
<p>People have been suing internet platforms for banning them since long before Trump took office; back in 2009, for instance, a PlayStation Network user sued on the grounds that Sony had created a “company town.” (The user lost.) Courts have overwhelmingly concluded that social media networks can ban, limit, or otherwise suppress users’ posts. Conversely, government figures like Trump actually face strict rules about blocking users. Last year, a court required Trump to unblock Twitter accounts that had criticized him, determining that his Twitter account specifically — not the site as a whole — constituted a public space protected by the First Amendment. Other public officials have lost similar lawsuits from constituents.</p>
<p>That leads to the question of what practical effect today’s executive order will have, and Democratic members of Congress, legal scholars, academics, and most journalists I follow have been united in predicting it will not survive legal challenges. Here’s Russell Brandom with a good, concise explanation of the reasons in The Verge:</p>
<p>The biggest one is the First Amendment, which prevents the US government from limiting private speech. Telling Twitter how and when it can moderate is going to look an awful lot like limiting the company’s private speech — particularly when the inciting incident was about adding content rather than blocking it. In practical terms, it means that there is certain to be a court challenge alleging that the order is unconstitutional, which will hamstring any attempted action by the FCC. That’s not the only legal problem, although I’m not sure we have room to run through all of them here. It’s not clear that the FCC has the authority to do any of this on the basis of an executive order. It’s really not clear that you can change 230 (which is part of a law, let’s remember) without congressional approval. And even if you could, all the usual concerns about changing 230 still apply. This wouldn’t just hit Twitter. The FCC would suddenly be in charge of YouTube, Craigslist, and every comments section on the internet.</p>
<p>Yesterday I noted here that while Trump’s bluster against social networks often results in a flurry of coverage, it hasn’t ever really gone much further. Well, this is going further. If the courts strike it down, as everyone expects, then in retrospect it will just look like more bluster. But if Trump finds a legal footing, then a lot of sites on the internet are going to be in trouble — and not just social networks, by the way.</p>
<p>And even if he doesn’t, we’ll still have seen a deeply disturbing encroachment of the federal government on actual free speech — part of a new surge in American authoritarianism that threatens our internet, our elections, and so much more. Today the president is focused on a handful of social networks that have challenged his power. But it still seems both obvious and necessary to say that if he wins, he won’t stop there.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Given that the executive order threatens every social platform equally, you might expect some level of solidarity in the corporate response. And trade groups to which the big platforms belong did put out statements condemning the order as unworkable nonsense.</p>
<p>But Mark Zuckerberg raised some eyebrows Wednesday night when he appeared on Fox News and appeared to draw a distinction between Facebook’s approach to moderating speech and Twitter’s:</p>
<p>“We have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this,” Zuckerberg told ”The Daily Briefing” in an interview scheduled to air in full on Thursday. “I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn’t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,” he added. “Private companies probably shouldn’t be, especially these platform companies, shouldn’t be in the position of doing that.”</p>
<p>On Thursday he elaborated on these points in an interview with CNBC:</p>
<p>I don’t think that Facebook or internet platforms, in general, should be arbiters of truth. I think that’s kind of a dangerous line to get down to, in terms of deciding what is true and what isn’t. And I think political speech is one of the most sensitive parts of a democracy. And people should be able to see what politicians say. And there’s tons of scrutiny already—political speech is the most scrutinized speech already by a lot of the media. And I think that that will continue. [&hellip;] You know, just because we don’t want to be determining what is true and false, you know, doesn’t mean that politicians or anyone else can just say whatever they want. And our policies are grounded in trying to give people as much voice as possible while saying, if you’re going to harm people in specific ways &hellip; we will take them down no matter who says that.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg then mentions a case in which Facebook removed a post by the president of Brazil. “There are lines, and we will enforce them,” he said. “But I think in general you want to give as wide of a voice possible. And I think you want to have a special deference to political speech.”</p>
<p>The weird thing about all this is that, as best I can tell, Facebook and Twitter’s policies around election misinformation are essentially the same. Facebook introduced policies prohibiting voter suppression and intimidation in 2018, and expanded its guidelines in October. The policies prohibit:</p>
<p>Misrepresentation of the dates, locations, times and methods for voting or voter registration (e.g. “Vote by text!”); misrepresentation of who can vote, qualifications for voting, whether a vote will be counted and what information and/or materials must be provided in order to vote (e.g. “If you voted in the primary, your vote in the general election won’t count.”); and threats of violence relating to voting, voter registration or the outcome of an election.</p>
<p>Twitter adopted similar rules this month.</p>
<p>You can argue that Trump’s baseless warnings about voter fraud related to voting by mail haven’t yet “misrepresented methods for voting or voter registration.” But you can’t say Facebook isn’t an arbiter of truth on election information. If you go on Facebook tonight and post that “Republicans vote a week later Democrats,” Facebook will remove that post without even sending it to a fact-checker first.</p>
<p>Of course, Jack Dorsey complicated all of this by posting a confusing Twitter thread in which he said of the company’s decision to label two of Trump’s tweets: “This does not make us an ‘arbiter of truth.’ Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves.” Maybe Twitter isn’t playing truth-decider in this case — it just added a link to some tweets, after all — but it does so in plenty of other cases, and in fact updated its policies just this month so it could do so more often.</p>
<p>So what was Twitter’s policy rationale for labeling Trump’s tweets? Will Oremus has a tick-tock in One Zero that explains how the tweets traveled through the company. A third-party fact checker flagged them as potentially violating rules against election misinformation that date back to 2018. Twitter decided they did not, but a secondary review found that they could be eligible for one of the company’s new labels, which it introduced this month as part of an effort to fight misinformation about COVID-19.</p>
<p>Twitter said it made the decision to add links to Trump’s tweets about vote-by-mail fraud in line with this new policy, even though the connection between vote-by-mail and COVID-19 may not be clear to many people. (The idea is that more people will want to vote by mail to avoid getting sick at the polls, which happened to 52 people during the recent election in Wisconsin.)</p>
<p>Given everything Trump tweeted before Twitter decided to label two of his tweets — threatening nuclear war comes to mind — it does seem strange the company chose mail-in-ballots, of all places, to challenge the president. It would have been a more clear-cut violation if the president had tweeted “Democrats aren’t allowed to vote in November,” for example, or “I’m canceling the election.” But the spirit of Trump’s tweets is to suppress voter turnout and misrepresent the legitimacy of legally cast, mail-in ballots — and that seems like as good a content-moderation hill for a company to die on as any other.</p>
<p>It is messy, though, and while Twitter has always been messy, Facebook works hard to keep things consistent. And this is the basic reason Trump’s tweets got a label on Twitter but the same words, cross-posted to Facebook, went unchanged. Trump might have walked right up to the line but with his threats about voter fraud, but Facebook didn’t see a clear violation. The real policy, as ever, is what you enforce. Twitter took a novel approach to putting limits on the president; that’s fine for Twitter, but Facebook is staying out of it.</p>

<p>⭐ Twitter is continuing to fact-check Donald Trump’s tweets as the war between the president and social media platforms escalates. And other people’s tweets, too. Here are Kate Conger and Mike Isaac at The New York Times:</p>
<p>Late Wednesday, it added fact-checking labels to messages from Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry who had claimed that the coronavirus outbreak may have begun in the United States and been brought to China by the U.S. military. Twitter also added notices on hundreds of tweets that falsely claimed a photo of a man in a red baseball cap was Derek Chauvin, an officer involved in the death of George Floyd, an African-American man who died this week after being handcuffed and pinned to the ground by police. The Twitter label alerted viewers that the image was “manipulated media.”</p>
<p>A German official suggested Twitter reincorporate in Germany if things get too bad with Trump. “Here you are free to criticize the government as well as to fight fake news,” tweeted Thomas Jarzombek, who works on economic development. (Douglas Busvine / Reuters)</p>
<p>Facebook is rolling out a new policy to limit inauthentic behavior. The company is going to require that the people behind “high reach” profiles verify their identity. Viral posts from unverified accounts will have limited reach. This is a really interesting move, and I’m planning to learn more and share soon. (Taylor Lyles / The Verge)</p>
<p>Researchers are trying to “flatten the curve” of the infodemic by rooting out coronavirus misinformation. They say the battle that can’t be won completely — it’s just not possible to stop people from spreading ill-founded rumors. (Philip Ball and Amy Maxmen / Nature)</p>

<p>The tenant screening industry is growing, fueled by the rapid expansion of rentership in the US. The companies produce cheap and fast reports for an estimated nine out of 10 landlords across the country. But the reports are extremely flawed, attributing crimes to perspective tenants that they never committed. (Lauren Kirchner and Matthew Goldstein / The Markup and The New York Times)</p>
<p>Industry</p>
<p>⭐ Amazon plans to offer permanent jobs to about 70 percent of the people it hired to temporarily meet consumer demand during the coronavirus pandemic. The company will begin telling 125,000 warehouse employees in June that they can keep their roles longer-term. Jeffrey Dastin at Reuters has the story:</p>
<p>The decision is a sign that Amazon’s sales have increased sufficiently to justify an expanded workforce for order fulfillment, even as government lockdowns ease and rivals open their retail stores for pickup. Amazon started the hiring spree in March with a blog post appealing to workers laid off by restaurants and other shuttered businesses, promising employment “until things return to normal and their past employer is able to bring them back.”</p>

<p>Kuaishou, the second-largest social video app in China, is launching an app in the US to challenge TikTok. The app, called Zynn, allows users to upload, edit and share short videos. In a twist, it’s also paying users to watch content and recruit other users. (Yunan Zhang / The Information)</p>

<p>YouTube is full of scams advertising access to OnlyFans content for free if you follow a few steps to “unlock” premium accounts. The videos instruct users to download and interact with apps for a certain time in exchange for access to OnlyFans that never materializes. (Samantha Cole / Vice)</p>
<p>There’s a scientific explanation for why Zoom is so exhausting. Looming heads, staring eyes, a silent audience, and that millisecond delay disrupt normal human communication. (Betsy Morris / The Wall Street Journal)</p>

<h3 id="trumps-voter-fraud-claims-refuted-by-fec-commissioner-in-fact-check">&ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s voter fraud claims refuted by FEC commissioner in fact-check&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.axios.com/jSKTCx9UY3omE4R-G3tbsB9xlpY=/fit-in/1920x1920/2020/05/28/1590649007683.jpg" alt="img">
Federal Election Commission commissioner Ellen Weintraub posted an extensive fact-checking thread to Twitter late Wednesday debunking claims by President Trump and some Republicans that mail-in voting can lead to fraud.</p>
<p>Why it matters: Weintraub weighed in after Trump threatened to take action against Twitter for fact-checking him on his earlier unsubstantiated posts claiming mail-in ballots in November&rsquo;s election would be fraudulent, and she directly addressed Twitter&rsquo;s action against the president in her post.</p>
<p>What she&rsquo;s saying: &ldquo;U.S. citizens will vote by mail this year in record numbers. In the face of a global health emergency, election officials across the country from both parties are working heroically to ensure that voting by mail is accurate, accessible, safe &amp; secure,&rdquo; she tweeted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s simply no basis for the conspiracy theory that voting by mail causes fraud. None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big picture: Weintraub&rsquo;s comments come as White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told news outlets including Axios that President Trump planned to sign an executive order aimed at social media companies on Thursday.</p>
<p>Trump accused Twitter of interfering in November&rsquo;s elections by fact-checking him.</p>
<p>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey clarified on the microblogging site Wednesday night that the firm fact-checked Trump&rsquo;s tweets amid concern they &ldquo;may mislead people into thinking they don&rsquo;t need to register to get a ballot (only registered voters receive ballots).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trump and some Republicans have repeatedly railed against states that have announced plans to expand voting-by-mail options during the coronavirus pandemic, casting doubt on the reliability of the system.</p>
<p>Of note: Weintraub recommended in March that Americans should vote in the general election by mail if physically going to the polls remained unsafe because of the threat of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Last year, Weintraub told CNN there was &ldquo;no evidence of rampant voter fraud in 2016 or really in any previous election,&rdquo; despite Trump&rsquo;s claims.</p>
<p>Weintraub said at the time such statements from the president can cause &ldquo;people to lose faith&rdquo; and &ldquo;to question the results.&rdquo; She also sent him a letter asking him &ldquo;to provide any evidence&rdquo; that could prove his claims.</p>

Will Tech’s Monopolies Survive 2020?</p>
<p>How the triple turmoil of a pandemic, protests, and a presidential election threatens Silicon Valley’s status quo.</p>
<p>Photo: Wang Ying/Xinhua via Getty</p>
<p>Welcome back to Pattern Matching, OneZero’s weekly newsletter that puts the week’s most compelling tech stories in context.</p>
<p>There was a brief moment, at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic’s first wave in the United States, when it looked like Big Tech might be back in the public’s good graces. With stay-at-home orders across the country, screens were no longer an addictive distraction from real life, but the locus of real life itself. Zoom was powering business meetings; Houseparty, happy hours. Facebook was once again a dominant force in news; Apple and Google were partnering on a privacy-conscious contact tracing app. Politicians in the United States and Europe who had been laying the groundwork for new regulations suddenly had more urgent things to worry about.</p>
<p>That moment has passed. The lifting of lockdowns has been greeted not with sighs of relief at a return to the status quo, but with rallying cries to change it. There are protests in the streets. A presidential election looms. While criminal justice reform tops the domestic agenda, the appetite for tech reform appears to have returned as well.</p>
<p>The Pattern</p>
<p>Big Tech is back in the hot seat.</p>
<p>💬 The European Commission this week opened two antitrust probes against Apple, focusing on how its App Store rules and Apple Pay system, respectively, hamstring competitors. The App Store investigation was sparked by a 2019 complaint from Spotify about Apple’s practice of taking 30 percent of all subscription revenues from users who sign up for third-party apps on iOS. That puts Spotify at a disadvantage in competing with Apple’s own Apple Music service, from which Apple keeps 100 percent of revenues. (In 2018, Spotify stopped allowing users to pay via iOS.) The Apple Pay investigation, meanwhile, will examine how Apple limits the use of its devices’ “tap and go” payment functionality to Apple Pay alone, once again giving its own service a big edge over competitors.</p>
<p>💬 Spotify is hardly the only company affected. I wrote in depth in February about the brewing antitrust case against Apple, and the developers lining up to testify against it. In a twist of timing, one of those developers, Basecamp, launched a new paid email app, called Hey, on the same day the EU investigation was announced. Apple rejected it, on the grounds that it doesn’t allow the in-app subscription options that would give Apple its 30-percent cut. Protocol’s David Pierce recounted how that decision went down, while The Verge’s Dieter Bohn blasted Apple for inconsistencies in how it enforces its rules. Even Apple blogger Jon Gruber, who often defends the company, agreed that the company’s rent-seeking has gone too far. (Meanwhile, if you’re interested in Hey, read developer Kaya Thomas’ OneZero review of the buzzy, pricey new email platform.)</p>
<p>💬 Even mighty Facebook can’t get its apps onto Apple devices when they compete directly with Apple’s own offerings. The New York Times reported Thursday that Apple has rejected Facebook Gaming, the social network’s new casual gaming app, at least five times in the past four months, citing policies against apps that function primarily as game stores. Google, for its part, quickly approved Facebook Gaming on the Google Play store in April. Illustrating the user-unfriendly effects of Apple’s restrictions, the Times article explains that Facebook’s approach to getting its app approved has involved continually making the interface less intuitive, on the theory that this would make it less store-like.</p>
<p>💬 That Apple governs its App Store with impunity, and often to its own advantage, is not new. Neither is it new that Apple’s own apps sometimes compete with, copy, and crowd out those made for its platforms by independent developers. What is different now are the scope of Apple’s first-party app ambitions, the number of developers willing to risk the giant’s ire by speaking out, and the willingness of people in power to listen. In OneZero this week, Owen Williams argues that the EU case could be “a defining moment for the technology industry, as companies like Google and Facebook may find themselves scrutinized in a similar way.” And speaking of Google…</p>
<p>💬 Google made a similar power play this week by integrating its Meet videoconferencing software into the Gmail app. It’s a transparent attempt to leverage Google’s dominance in one market — email, in this case — against a rival (Zoom) that was outcompeting it in another market.</p>
<p>💬 The regulatory fervor is not confined to Europe. Back in the United States, the right broadened its assault on Section 230 this week, as Sen. Josh Hawley introduced a bill that would make it easier to sue tech companies for inconsistencies in how they moderate content. The move comes two weeks after Donald Trump signed an executive order challenging the legal protections that online platforms enjoy under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Gizmodo’s Dell Cameron argues that the bill, like Trump’s order, is mostly toothless: It still allows companies to set their own rules of moderation, as long as they stick to them and apply them equally to all parties “in good faith.”</p>
<p>💬 And yet that even that mushy qualifier could open the door to enough lawsuits that some companies may simply decide a more hands-off approach is safest. Which is, of course, what Trump and Hawley want: for social platforms to keep their paws off of racist or false content from right-wing sources, including the president himself. This week conveniently brought us an illustration of the kind of dustup that could turn into a lawsuit, when NBC News reported that Google had banned the financial site ZeroHedge and conservative political site The Federalist from its ad network for spreading racist conspiracy theories about the anti-police brutality protests. As an uproar spread — both sites have large, vocal followings — Google disputed NBC News’ story. Google said The Federalist was never demonetized, but that it had reached an agreement with the publisher that involved removing racist comments from The Federalist’s comment section.</p>
<p>💬 These are the types of interventions that liberals and civil rights activists, along with some of tech companies’ own employees, have been calling for. (Some civil rights groups are now calling on companies to boycott Facebook’s ad platform.) They’re also the type that get the right riled up and build momentum for bills like Hawley’s, as Ben Shapiro and Ted Cruz were quick to rail against Google’s moves this week. As I wrote in a previous newsletter, we appear to have at last reached the point where the big platforms have to pick a side. Twitter was the first to do so, when it started flagging some of Trump’s tweets as misleading, and the company kept up its enforcement against him this week by putting a warning label on a video he tweeted. The video fabricated fake CNN footage of a “terrified” Black toddler running away from a “racist baby,” then implied that the network was spreading divisive fake news (a classic example of Trumpian projection).</p>
<p>💬 Facebook has opted for the laissez-faire approach to Trump’s posts, but even it felt compelled to take action this week when the liberal blog Media Matters for America reported that the president was running Facebook ads with Nazi iconography. (Trump’s campaign then claimed the inverted red triangle was an antifa symbol — which is a lie, according to historians who study the group.) Facebook removed the 88 offending ads.</p>
<p>💬 Antitrust enforcement and Section 230 reform are separate issues. But the growing momentum behind both is indicative of a larger trend: Big Tech has lost the benefit of the doubt. That happened long ago in Europe, but it is finally happening in the United States as well, from both major parties. And any notion that the pandemic or a Republican presidency would ease the regulatory pressure on Silicon Valley has now been put to rest. Americans of all ideologies are fed up with business as usual, their polarization arguably stoked by the tech platforms themselves, and their economic stability undermined by the rise of the gig economy. In other words, we’re living in a mess that is partly of the tech industry’s making. And now that mess is coming back to haunt it.</p>
<p>Undercurrents</p>
<p>Under-the-radar trends, stories, and random anecdotes worth your time</p>
<p>🗨️ Two Black leaders at Pinterest left the company over racial discrimination, saying they were subjected to offensive comments, unfair pay, and retaliation. CEO Ben Silbermann subsequently issued a public apology and admitted “parts of our culture are broken,” Bloomberg’s Sarah Frier reported. But the ex-employees, Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks, who made up two-thirds of the platform’s public policy and social impact team, said on Twitter that they heard the apology only through the media. Their allegations are part of a wider reckoning over tech companies’ treatment of Black employees, and they dent the reputation of a platform that had previously earned praise for some progressive policies — which, it turns out, Ozoma and Banks had been criticized by their managers for championing. Read Ozoma’s full thread here.</p>
<p>🗨️ Lesser-known face recognition companies are eagerly courting law enforcement, looking to fill the vacuum after IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon stepped back. Clearview AI, NEC, nd Ayonix are among those poised to capitalize by ignoring the anger over surveillance technology’s discriminatory effects on Black communities, the Wall Street Journal reported. My OneZero colleague Dave Gershgorn has written about an even longer list of companies, including many that you might not expect, that have been trying to cash in on a face recognition gold rush. In Bloomberg Opinion, Cathy O’Neil makes the case that face recognition by law enforcement will continue until or unless Congress repeals post-9/11 legislation, such as the Real ID Act, that prioritized antiterrorism efforts over civil liberties.</p>
<p>🗨️ Instagram’s algorithm systematically incentivizes its users to show skin in their photos, according to a report from the nonprofit AlgorithmWatch.</p>
<p>🗨️ The great scourge of bots on social media may be overstated, bot expert Darius Kazemi argued, in a New York Times article by Siobhan Roberts.</p>

<h3 id="washington-dc-mayor-muriel-bowser-on-black-lives-matter-trump">&ldquo;Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser on Black Lives Matter, Trump&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&amp;c=sc&amp;poi=%5B510%2C345%5D&amp;w=1000&amp;h=524&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F06%2F10%2FMuriel-Bowser-.jpg" alt="img">
From left: Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser and Georgia Rep. John Lewis on Black Lives Matter Plaza in front of the White House on Sunday.</p>
<p>It’s been a long spring for Muriel Bowser. The two-term Washington, D.C., mayor has been simultaneously dealing with both the novel coronavirus pandemic and high unemployment from the social distancing shutdowns to slow infections.</p>
<p>The virus has spread close to her: She lost one of her advisers to the coronavirus disease COVID-19. Meanwhile, she’s grappled with the financial burdens in her city, rising worker by unemployed worker. She spoke out for D.C.’s fair share of stimulus money after it was unusually treated like a U.S. territory, instead of a state, in a federal relief bill passed in March. And while the weeks roll on into summer, the District seems stuck in phase one of reopening.</p>
<p>Get push notifications with news, features and more.</p>
<p>She’s been criticized from many sides. And yet, at least publicly, she has maintained her composure. “I think best when I’m calm,” the 47-year-old single mother, who has held elected office in the nation’s capital for 15 years, tells PEOPLE.</p>
<p>Then George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>In D.C. — as in many other parts of the country — protests against police misconduct and racial injustice spread in the wake of video showing Floyd, who is black, pleading for air while a white office knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes.</p>
<p>The largely peaceful demonstrations sometimes seethed into violence, with looting and arson. Bowser declared an emergency, called in the D.C. National Guard and imposed a curfew — as had many other local leaders nationwide. But Bowser’s job balancing public safety with immense public outcry was made yet more complicated: Her city includes the White House, and President Donald Trump has not been shy about sharing his thoughts on the unruly demonstrations.</p>
<p>The morning after the first night of protests in D.C., during which the president was taken to the White House’s underground bunker reportedly following a brief intrusion on the grounds, Trump applauded the job of the Secret Service and thanked them for his safety. In a lengthy Twitter thread, however, he seemed to relish the violence that could have been unleashed on the crowds outside the gates.</p>
<p>“Nobody came close to breaching the fence. If they had they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and the most ominous weapons, I have ever seen,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Then he pilloried Bowser, who “wouldn’t let the D.C. Police get involved.”</p>

<p>Bowser said that wasn’t true and volleyed back with her own tweets. “My police department will always protect DC and all who are in it [including Trump] …. I stand w/people peacefully exercising their First Amendment Right after the murder of #GeorgeFloyd &amp; hundreds of years of institutional racism.”</p>
<p>“There are no vicious dogs &amp; ominous weapons,” she wrote. “There is just a scared man.”</p>
<p>The war of words tipped over into too much for Bowser when the Trump administration sent in military and other federal agents in response to the protests near the White House. The night of June 1, they forcibly cleared peaceful protesters from the area, ahead of the imposed curfew, so Trump and other officials could walk to the nearby St. John’s Episcopal Church in a photo-op that his aides argued was meant to project resolve amid chaos. (St. John’s had been damaged by a small fire during the protest.)</p>
<p>The trip drew widespread backlash, including from local religious leaders.</p>
<p>Bowser called it a “political stunt,” then she devised a stunt of her own — a message, in her words, of humanity instead of division.</p>
<p>All she needed was some space.</p>
<p>She had to cede Lafayette Square across from the White House, a historic location for protests, because it was, in fact, federal land, and was now fenced. The street leading up to the park, however, was in her jurisdiction. She wanted transform a section 16th Street that leads up to the park into “a place where people felt safe addressing their grievances.”</p>
<p>She commissioned muralists to write “Black Lives Matter” in giant yellow letters in the dark of night. On Friday morning, the city woke up to a newly named Black Lives Matter Plaza that runs past the St. Regis and Hay Adams hotels, with the D.C. flags’ stars and stripes ending the mural just before St. John’s.</p>
<p>At the unveiling, a recording was played of Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous 1968 speech in support of striking sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee.</p>
<p>Image zoom People walk down 16th Street after volunteers, with permission from the city, painted &ldquo;Black Lives Matter&rdquo; near the White House.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of anger, there’s a lot of distrust of police and the government, there are people who are craving to be heard and to be seen and to have their humanity recognized,” Bowser said at a Friday afternoon press conference. “We had that opportunity to send that message loud and clear on a very important street in our city. That message is to the American people, that black lives matter, black humanity matters and we as a city raise that up as part of our values as a city.”</p>
<p>By 2 p.m., the president weighed in with a new Twitter attack, calling Bowser “incompetent” and slamming her for what he called an out-of-control budget. He said she was “constantly coming back to us for ‘handouts.’ ” He took issue with the mayor’s complaint that the city would not be paying for hotel rooms for out-of-state National Guards, whom she hadn’t requested alongside the D.C. guardsman she had, instead asking that they be sent home with active-duty military.</p>
<p>“If she doesn’t treat these men and women well, then we’ll bring a different group of men and women!” Trump wrote.</p>
<p>Bowser read the tweet quickly during her press conference. Asked about it by a reporter, she said, “There are so many things that I could respond to in that tweet, but I think we all have to just refocus on what’s in front of us. Our nation is hurting, it’s in need of healing and leadership at all levels, all the way from the top to mayors like me and to all of us, to focus on how we bring people together.”</p>
<p>Asked later about the president’s criticism of her competency, she smiled. “You know the thing about the pot and the kettle?”</p>
<p>The city’s blocks-spanning mural was not universally lauded. Black Lives Matter DC was upset with Bowser using their slogan without accepting their platform.</p>
<p>A day after the mural was unveiled, the group changed the painted D.C. flag to an equals sign. While some activists&rsquo; call to defund the police has gained renewed attention, Bowser said she was not swayed. &ldquo;My budget doesn&rsquo;t fund it a penny more than we need and certainly not a penny less. &hellip; [C]ertainly we wouldn&rsquo;t want the people on our forces not to have the proper training or equipment that makes for better community policing.,&rdquo; she told NPR this week.</p>
<p>“There are going to be a lot of different opinions,” Bowser tells PEOPLE.</p>
<p>She is proud of the mark the mural has made. “We think it’s going to have a place not just in D.C. history, but in American history,” she says. The city council also quickly passed emergency legislation aimed at further police reforms, though Bowser — who said she supported it — urged a slower process with more public discussion.</p>
<p>“Allowing for community input and vetting by our residents can only serve to refine and strengthen changes to policing in the District,” she wrote.</p>

<p>While Bowser worked seven days in a row when the George Floyd protests began, she takes time out for her adopted 2-year-old, Miranda, whom the very private mayor debuted on the Today show in 2018, when her little girl was 4 months old.</p>
<p>“She still needs Mom to take care of her to love her and be present,” Bowser tells PEOPLE. The novel coronavirus — still spreading even as the national unrest has overlapped it as a crisis — keeps doting grandparents away. But Bowser, the first single mom to helm the capital city, downplays the stress of juggling. “There are a lot of moms out there who have a lot more to deal with than I do and less resources to do it,” she says.</p>
<p>Mother and toddler live near Rock Creek Park and Bowser, who never married, says she walks with close friends and talks about all that’s going on at work and at home. “I don’t do well with silos in my life,” she says. “It all blends together.” She was happy to have this Sunday off, which gave her a chance to garden and catch up on housework.

<h3 id="the-toddler-in-chief-thread-is-now-3-years-old">&ldquo;The Toddler in Chief thread is now 3 years old&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YGBVLRR5FMI6TMIL6BNCFZ2YMU.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">

<p>Looking back on the past three years of curating this thread, a few things stand out. The persistence of the toddler analogy as deployed by Trump staffers has been surprising. After two years, I had accumulated 719 tweets; over the past year alone, I added 639 entries. I wondered whether, as Trump purged more and more staff, those who remained would be such die-hard loyalists that they would be less willing to talk about the president like a toddler.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Such concerns proved to be misplaced. In the 24 hours after Trump mused about the possibility of injecting people with disinfectants to ward off the coronavirus, NBC News, CNN, Axios, the New York Times and The Washington Post all ran stories containing administration officials’ reactions to the debacle. Each of them included novel information about an exasperated staff coping with a restless president who is bouncing off the walls of the White House. Combined, these stories led to one of the busiest days ever for the #ToddlerinChief thread. This theme will persist as long as Trump is president.</p>
<p>Another lesson is that Trump’s toddler traits have been on such full display during the biggest crisis of his presidency. The toddler thesis explains much of the federal government’s pandemic response. In some ways, this is surprising. When the stakes have been high, Trump has been able to demonstrate a modicum of discipline. During the waning stages of the 2016 campaign, Trump had demonstrated a willingness to listen to his advisers and stay on message.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>You would think that a national crisis would have forced Trump’s instinct for self-preservation to kick in, but no. Since his brief rally-round-the-flag bump dissipated, he has been trapped in a doom loop: Sagging poll numbers lead him to believe he can fix the situation with more press coverage, which inevitably results in more gaffes, which lead to more sagging poll numbers. Little wonder, as CNN’s Harry Enten observes, that Trump is dominating Biden in media coverage and yet losing to him all the same.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Even if Trump’s advisers succeed in getting him to throttle back his news conferences, it probably won’t do him much good. For one thing, he’s already done a lot of self-damage. There is no shortage of material for political ads.</p>
<p>For another, if he does not lash out in the news conferences, he will lash out on Twitter instead, and just as much self-sabotaging will happen.</p>

<p>Those tweets were so bad that Trump deleted them and later claimed it was just “sarcasm,” which is about as believable as his alleged sarcasm about injecting disinfectant into coronavirus patients.</p>
<p>My final takeaway is that, weirdly, there is one reassuring element to Trump’s immaturity: It suggests that a smoother, more illiberal version of Trump will not do as well politically. Trump’s toddler mode of governance has hampered his ability to govern, but some fear that a smarter Republican — say, Josh Hawley or Tom Cotton — will sand away Trump’s rough edges, win the presidency and govern in an even more illiberal manner.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>What this misses is that a large fraction of Trump’s supporters revel in the president’s immaturity. They like the fact that he’s rude, crude and thoroughly immature. Because being mature is hard. It requires attention to manners, norms, customs, appearances and other people’s feelings. If you act like an entitled, petulant brat, however, you get to do fun things if you occupy a position of power, like, say, ordering U.S. Military Academy cadets back to campus for a speech. Or take this anecdote, from a 2017 Time cover story about dinner with Trump at the White House:</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The waiters know well Trump’s personal preferences. As he settles down, they bring him a Diet Coke, while the rest of us are served water, with the Vice President sitting at one end of the table. With the salad course, Trump is served what appears to be Thousand Island dressing instead of the creamy vinaigrette for his guests. When the chicken arrives, he is the only one given an extra dish of sauce. At the dessert course, he gets two scoops of vanilla ice cream with his chocolate cream pie, instead of the single scoop for everyone else.
