<p>Move over, Mr. Monopoly. There’s a new entrepreneur in town, and she’s taking over the boardroom, er, board game.</p>
<p>Toymaker Hasbro Inc. on Tuesday announced the launch of Ms. Monopoly, a modernized reboot of its iconic money-making board game meant to celebrate female trailblazers and create a world where women make more money than men. It also brings to mind a little-known fact about Monopoly, though Hasbro didn’t mention it: A woman invented the game more than a century ago.</p>
<p>There’s a new mascot on the game’s cover, too: the brunet Ms. Monopoly, niece of the dapper, top-hat-wearing Mr. Monopoly (also known as Rich Uncle Pennybags). Alas, she does not sport a monocle, but she does wear some pretty mean M-shaped earrings.</p>
<p>“The Ms. Monopoly game marks the first time in the franchise’s history where a new character will grace the cover — and while Mr. Monopoly is a real estate mogul, Ms. Monopoly is an advocate whose mission is to invest in female entrepreneurs,” Hasbro said in a statement.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The capitalism game features a new look but similar classic game play. Spots on the board such as railroads and the electric company are replaced with ride-hailing services and Wi-Fi, and properties such as the coveted Park Place make way for groundbreaking inventions and innovations created by women throughout history, including chocolate chip cookies, solar heating and modern shapewear.</p>
<p>Instead of building houses and hotels, players build business headquarters. The game pieces include a hard hat, wristwatch, book, jet, goblet and free weight.</p>
<p>“Ms. Monopoly celebrates everything from scientific advancements to everyday accessories — all created by women,” Hasbro said.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>A slogan on the box bills it as “the first game where women make more than men,” flipping the real world’s gender pay disparity. In 2018, women earned 85% of what men earned, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of median hourly earnings of full- and part-time workers in the United States. And companies founded only by women received just 2.3% of venture capital funding in the U.S. last year, according to PitchBook — though it is trending upward.</p>
<p>In the game, the banker doles out $1,900 of Monopoly money to each female player at the beginning, while each male player starts with $1,500, according to USA Today. After that, female players collect $240 when they pass “Go,” whereas their male counterparts collect the traditional $200.</p>

<p>The Monopoly game was the brainchild of a woman named Lizzie Magie at the turn of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>According to the 2015 book “The Monopolists,” which chronicled the storied history of the iconic American game, Magie was an ardent feminist stuck in a low-wage stenography job. She created what she called the Landlord’s Game to propagate the ideas of Henry George, a 19th century proponent of “single tax theory,” who believed that land ownership was the only thing that should be taxed.</p>
<p>Her game shared many features with Monopoly as we know it, including play money, properties that could be bought and sold, and a “Go to Jail” directive (all of which also exist in Ms. Monopoly). When Magie received a patent for her Landlord’s Game in 1904, “less than 1% of all patents issued in the United States went to women,” according to “The Monopolists.”</p>
<p>Decades later, unemployed salesman Charles Darrow learned the game from friends, repackaged it and, in 1935, sold it as his own creation.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Hasbro made no mention of Magie in its Tuesday news release and did little to explain her omission when pressed by the Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>“The Monopoly game as we know it was invented by Charles Darrow, who sold his idea to Parker Brothers in 1935,” a Hasbro spokeswoman told The Times on Tuesday. “However, there have been a number of popular property-trading games throughout history. Elizabeth Magie — a writer, inventor and feminist — was one of the pioneers of land-grabbing games. In 1904, she received a patent for the Landlord’s Game, which was meant to educate people about the dangers of wealth concentration.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to celebrate next month’s launch of Ms. Monopoly and spotlight other women who have challenged the status quo, Hasbro said it surprised several young female inventors and entrepreneurs with the game and approximately $20,580 in real money “to fuel their inventive spirit and further their projects.” A trio of teenage girls was featured in a video vignette announcing Ms. Monopoly’s launch.</p>
<p>Ms. Monopoly is the latest revamp of the treasured board game, which has seen thousands of spinoffs and themed reboots since its official debut in the Depression era. (In what was considered a major overhaul in 2017, the game did away with the scorned thimble, wheelbarrow and boot tokens and replaced them with a T-Rex, rubber duck and penguin.)</p>
<p>The new game is available for pre-order now at Walmart and will be available at most major retailers nationwide and in select countries globally starting later this month for a suggested retail price of $19.99.</p>

<p>Pawtucket, R.I.-based Hasbro suffered a blow when Toys R Us stores shut down last year, but the business has since regained momentum. Last month it struck a deal to buy Entertainment One Ltd., the owner of popular animated series “Peppa Pig,” for $4 billion. The toymaker’s stock is up more than 43% this year.

The Mandela Effect is a phenomenon that makes us question even the most mundane memories from the past. In June 2019, the famed New York Times crossword puzzle made it the theme, and defined it as, &ldquo;a recent refinement of false memory that typically refers to pop culture or current event references.&rdquo; Named by paranormal researcher Fiona Broome, it&rsquo;s basically remembering something that doesn&rsquo;t match with historical records. For example, the stuff you use to make your home smell fresh isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;Febreeze&rdquo; (more on that later).</p>
<p>Broome has said that she &ldquo;loves&rdquo; the idea that the Mandela Effect, or others claiming they distinctly recall different events or details, could be proof that we&rsquo;re existing in alternate realities. We&rsquo;re not so sure that&rsquo;s the truth, but these comparisons between popular belief and reality is making our jaws hit the floor as we type. Check out 40 of the most gobsmacking &ldquo;facts&rdquo; below.

Politics Crashes the TV Party</p>
<p>The first of two 30-second ads from President Trump’s campaign, which together cost more than $11 million, aired in the first commercial break after kickoff. The spot focused on Alice Marie Johnson, a woman who was serving a life sentence in federal prison on charges related to cocaine distribution and money laundering when her case was brought to Mr. Trump’s attention by Kim Kardashian West, the reality television star. Mr. Trump commuted Ms. Johnson’s sentence in 2018.</p>
<p>It was the first Super Bowl to feature national ads from two presidential candidates, and the political tone of the ads stood out in a broadcast filled with companies trying to avoid sensitive topics the day before the Democratic caucuses in Iowa.</p>
<p>Before the second-half kickoff, the billionaire presidential candidate Michael R. Bloomberg presented an ad about gun control that featured Calandrian Simpson-Kemp, whose football-loving son died in a shooting in 2013. Mr. Bloomberg has swarmed the Democratic field with over $275 million in advertising, according to the ad-tracking firm Advertising Analytics. This was not his first Super Bowl commercial touching on gun laws — he did the same in a 2012 ad with Thomas M. Menino, then the mayor of Boston.</p>
<p>The Jay-Z Influence</p>
<p>Another exception to the escapist fare was a spot on police shootings. Surprisingly, it came from an organization that has shied away from the issue: the National Football League. The spot showed the retired 49ers wide receiver Anquan Boldin reflecting on the 2015 death of his cousin, who was shot by a police officer, and it included a dramatic re-enactment of the killing.</p>
<p>The commercial promoted the N.F.L.’s Inspire Change initiative, a social outreach program that the league has put together with Roc Nation, the entertainment company founded by Jay-Z. Colin Kaepernick — Mr. Boldin’s onetime 49ers teammate — set off an uproar a year after the killing by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism and police brutality. The N.F.L. struggled with its response for years.

Law enforcement officers stand guard as protesters hold up signs during a rally against the death of George Floyd in Washington, D.C., May 31, 2020. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)</p>
<p>For reasons that do not bear going into here, the mostly forgotten novelty singer C. W. McCall came up in conversation with my brother the other day, and I ended up watching the 1978 film Convoy, which was inspired by the McCall song of the same name. In the late 1970s, truckers were the new cowboys, and Convoy is a kind of slapstick Western that pits admirable but law-breaking truckers against corrupt police officers. It ends with Kris Kristofferson’s antihero (known by his CB handle, “The Rubber Duck”) attempting to perpetrate a suicide bombing against a bunch of cops and soldiers blocking a border crossing into Mexico. A silly movie like Convoy can’t end like that, so instead a deus ex machina contrivance delivers the cops and the soldiers and the Rubber Duck, too, to safety. Even so, it is a rousing ode to lawlessness and terrorism — and the most popular film of Sam Peckinpah’s career.</p>
<p>Speaking of movies . . .</p>
<p>When Harvey Weinstein was sued by several women who claimed to have suffered sexual harassment or sexual assault at his hands and put some tens of millions of dollars on the table to settle the complaints, some blockheads denounced the accusers as women who “just want money” rather than genuine justice. The same thing was said about people who reached settlements with Michael Jackson after accusing him of sexually abusing them as children. The criticism begs the question. Who says that justice cannot take the form of money? Who says justice cannot take the form of other kinds of compensation?</p>
<p>Consider a less emotional kind of offense: Imagine that a powerful business executive had defrauded me of $100,000. That’s a lot of money. Now, imagine that I also had him dead to rights on the fraud and was ready to go to the police, when he made me an offer: What if he returned my $100,000, plus interest generously calculated for the time I was deprived of my money, plus $1 million in further restitution. Would I, the victim of the crime, rather have my money back plus $1 million, or spend months and years watching an uncertain criminal case build to a climax that might — might — end up looking something like six months in jail plus probation? I’d take the $1 million. Some people would look at that as the rich being able to buy their way out of criminal accountability; I’d look at it as the victim of a crime getting justice in the form of something that left him better off, rather than justice in the form of something that did not leave him better off. If one of Weinstein’s victims would rather have a check than add a little to his prison time, who are we — who are any of us — to tell her that she is wrong?</p>
<p>I am an optimist with a generally libertarian view of the individual’s relationship to the state, and for a long time I had very high hopes for private justice, by which I do not mean the abolition of the state and its legal mechanisms but the supersession of it by more fruitful alternatives in some circumstances. Many good-faith disputes already are better handled in voluntary arbitration than through the traditional courts, especially when they involve highly specialized matters with which judges and juries are sure to be unfamiliar. Many kinds of hurt and suffering cannot be undone, simply locking offenders away in cages is not always the best course of action for the victim or for society at large (and those interests may not be identical), and other alternatives often are preferable. There is a question of balancing restitution, rehabilitation, and deterrence. But there are also the more fundamental questions: Does this leave the victim better off in real terms? Does it make the general society safer?</p>
<p>Private justice can go wrong easily and dramatically, as events in the past few weeks have shown. There is nothing wrong, in principle, with laws permitting citizen arrests in certain circumstances, but that can quickly turn into bloodthirsty vigilantism, as in the case of Ahmaud Arbery. For a less lethal example, think of the case of Amy Cooper and Christian Cooper and that now-infamous Central Park confrontation. Christian Cooper was practicing a form of private justice: People are supposed to keep their dogs on leashes in the Ramble, Amy Cooper did not comply, and Christian Cooper, who had prior experience with this problem, was carrying dog treats, promising Amy Cooper that he was going to do . . . something, and “you’re not going to like it.” (I disagree with my friend Kyle Smith that this was an obvious threat to poison her dog; the threat was vague and might have meant any number of things.) Christian Cooper was practicing a pretty benign form of private justice in lieu of calling the NYPD every time somebody failed to leash a dog. Amy Cooper, who clearly did not like being called out on her petty offense, threatened to call the police and say that she was being threatened by an African-American man. Many of her critics insist that this was her in effect seeking to have him assassinated; if that really is the case, then the problem is the NYPD, not Amy Cooper, and it is not going to be solved by the personnel department at Franklin Templeton, with its uneven sense of justice.</p>
<p>(Franklin Templeton is much more forgiving of much more serious offenses if you happen to be the son of one CEO and the brother of two others.)</p>
<p>The case for private justice is, in part, that if we can resolve a private dispute without dispatching men with guns to the scene, then we are better off doing so; but if we are better off doing so because our law-enforcement authorities cannot be trusted to behave in a less than willfully homicidal fashion, then we have a problem that private justice is not going to solve.</p>
<p>Which brings us to Minneapolis and beyond. My friend and colleague Andy McCarthy believes that it took too long to arrest and charge Derek Chauvin in the case. (Indeed, Andy was registering this complaint on a National Review podcast when the arrest was announced.) I do not have Andy’s criminal-justice background (he is a former federal prosecutor, of terrorists among others), but it did not seem to me that the few days it took to arrest Chauvin was an unbearable delay of justice. One wants the authorities to move with some deliberation in these matters.</p>
<p>We might consider the rioting and the arson, then, as another attempt at private justice. One theory of the riots is this: Believing, with good reason, that the police will seek to protect their own and that officers who break the law will enjoy considerations that that typical offender would not, that racial injustice is systemic, and that reform is unlikely or impossible in the foreseeable future, the disorder and destruction is understood as a kind of fine on society at large. These riots fail as an attempt at private justice on the fundamental grounds: They do not leave the specific victim (or, in this case, his survivors) any better off, they do not actually advance the project of reforming police practice, and they leave society worse off, especially in the case of many of the communities on whose behalf the protesters purport to agitate. Of course it is the case that most of the looters and hell-raisers are not thinking things through in these terms, but I am not sure that really matters to our understanding of the situation.</p>
<p>Criminal violence as social sanction is not an unfamiliar idea: The theory of the riot is a lot like the theory of lynching, another violent crime that once was excused as rough justice. Lynching is a stain on American history, but there are other examples of criminal acts used as social sanction that were and are generally tolerated and sometimes even celebrated. In his famous essay on animal-trespass law, “Of Coase and Cattle,” Robert Ellickson found that the ranchers of Shasta County, Calif., rarely sued one another for damage caused by stray animals. Rather than sue one another or file legal complaints, the ranchers generally engaged in forms of private justice that had almost nothing to do with the formal assignment of rights and obligations under the actual law. This was made possible by a norm of “neighborliness,” reciprocity, and long-term relationships with repeated personal interactions, which make pettiness socially awkward. When there were actual legal disputes, Ellickson found, those cases normally involved newcomers who had not been habituated to community norms or situations in which one of the parties believed the other to be acting dishonestly and dishonorably, for example with one rancher going to law because another “had not only deliberately trespassed, but had also aggravated the offense by untruthfully denying the charge.”</p>
<p>But legal means were not the only means, and they were not the preferred means. These law-abiding, neighborly ranchers would also resort to unquestionably criminal acts.</p>
<p>Another common response to repeated trespasses is to threaten to kill a responsible animal should it ever enter again. Although the killing of trespassing livestock is a crime in California, six landowners — not noticeably less civilized than the others — unhesitatingly volunteered that they had issued death threats of this sort. These threats are credible in Shasta County, because victims of recurring trespasses, particularly if they have first issued a warning, feel justified in killing or injuring the mischievous animals. Despite the criminality of the conduct (a fact not necessarily known to the respondents), I learned the identity of two persons who had shot trespassing cattle. Another landowner told of running the steer of an uncooperative neighbor into a fence. The most intriguing report came from a rancher who had had recurrent problems with a trespassing bull many years ago. This rancher told a key law enforcement official that he wanted to castrate the bull — “to turn it into a steer.” The official replied that he “would have deaf ears” if that were to occur. The rancher asserted that he then carried out his threat.</p>
<p>This is roughly the equivalent of someone vandalizing your car for being illegally parked in front of their house. We had some neighbors’ guests pull accidentally into our driveway instead of our neighbors’ over the weekend, and we would have been perfectly happy to have them park there — we like our neighbors, and we have reciprocal ongoing relations with them that smooth over the little frictions that proximity brings. But much of modern urban life, with its institutional attitudes and endless bureaucracies, is not very well suited to cultivating the neighborliness that Ellickson wrote of, and that is especially true of relationships across cultural, racial, and class lines, which, given the fallen nature of human beings, are almost always more difficult than relationships among people who are like us.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to Convoy: It was made less than a decade past the worst bout of political violence and civic unrest the United States had seen since the Civil War, and almost exactly ten years after George Wallace had prefigured Donald Trump’s promise that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Convoy was itself part of a cinematic convoy, a little peloton of films such as Smokey and the Bandit glorifying charismatic outlaws who triumphed over wicked cops, fat old white men played by such actors as Ernest Borgnine and Jackie Gleason.</p>
<p>Many conservatives have noted accurately that the same progressive media figures who had their dresses over their heads about the anti-lockdown protests engaged in practically yogic exertions to put the violence and looting in Minneapolis and elsewhere in the best possible light and to give the most sympathetic possible account of it. These same progressive solons heaped abuse on the Tea Party protests, which were portrayed as a lynch mob in waiting, and every other episode in which a Republican has stepped into his penny loafers and raised a placard, back to the so-called Brooks Brothers Riot of 2000. They are not wrong to note the double standard.</p>
<p>At the same time, it surely is the case that if Convoy were a 2020 film about black outlaws or pissed-off Arabs, it would not receive the kind of welcome it did when it was a cri de cœur from white (mostly) truckers, and poor old Sam Peckinpah would be run out of town as an America-hating so-and-so. Bias isn’t a plot against the public good — it’s a consequence of the fact that we all live inside the scanty space of our skulls.</p>
<p>We are not an entirely orderly people, we Americans. We live by a shared idea rather than shared blood, and more than any other people in the world are defined by a group of legal and political documents rather than by ancient consanguinity. We salute George Washington, but there’s a little Whiskey Rebellion in us, too, a little John Brown, a little Patrick Henry, a little μολὼν λαβέ — and we are a lot more tolerant of that among white people than among others, especially among African Americans. I want order in Minneapolis and elsewhere. I want people to be safe and secure in their homes and businesses. There isn’t any liberty without peace. The riots are not leaving anybody better off, but consider that video of George Floyd’s death: Does that look like peace to you?</p>
<p>We are looking for that peace, and the justice that sustains it, in different ways. As Ellickson wrote, one of the most common means of “self help” for people seeking justice through private means is gossip, which is, essentially, what those Twitter mobs are: weaponized gossip. One of the many shortcomings of weaponized gossip is that gossip need not be true: Ask Brett Kavanaugh, or the Covington kids, or the University of Virginia, or the Duke lacrosse team . . . A kind of private justice is what Christian Cooper was after with his dog treats, and then with the video that led to Amy Cooper’s losing her job for an incident in her private life that had nothing to do with her work. Destruction of property as a means of sanction? It is happening in Minneapolis and other cities right now. But it happened before, on a smaller scale, among those Shasta County ranchers, too. Why did they resort to that? It wasn’t a lack of courts or lawyers or police officers.</p>
<p>It was a lack of mutual respect, honesty, honor, and neighborliness — the priceless things that cannot be had for a sum of money or drilled up out of the ground but can only be cultivated, slowly, painstakingly, with great effort and in great humility.</p>
<p>Words About Words</p>
<p>A very enjoyable article by horology writer Jack Forster describes the price of a certain exotic wristwatch as “over €1 million.” I understand leaving a lot of room on the upside for a shocking price like that, but — and pardon my English-major math here — my understanding is that there is an infinity of sums “over 1 million.” €1.1 million? €11 million? A more irritating version of this is the combination of “more than” or “over” with a very specific figure: “Senator Snout has voted to raise taxes more than 23 times.” More than 23 — like 24? Or like 23 trillion?</p>
<p>Rampant Prescriptivism</p>
<p>“Enamored with or enamored of?” asks a correspondent. Generally of, because enamored means “to be filled with love.” In American English, we often write with, probably under the influence of the phrase “in love with,” though in British English it is almost exclusively of. You can also write enamored by, but that means something different: If Paul is enamored of Susan, he is filled with the love of Susan. If Paul is enamored by Susan, he inspires love in Susan.</p>

<p>About that Amy Cooper story: Franklin Templeton, the firm that fired her after being bullied into it by a Twitter mob, says it does not “tolerate racism.” It is more tolerant in other cases. Franklin Templeton went out of its way to see to the well-being of a scion of the firm’s founding family, who was named to the company’s board of directors after doing time for a felony assault that left his wife with broken facial bones. You can read all about it in my New York Post column. It is good that there is grace and forgiveness for wayward financiers and sons of CEOs. Perhaps some of that could be spread around a little more.</p>

<p>The terrifying truth that we must keep in mind in troubled times such as these is that the world is what we make of it, a vast structure that we build one brick at a time with our own decisions. We can proceed with charity and grace, or we can proceed with violence and the threat of violence. The choice is yours and mine, as it always has been.</p>

<h3 id="cleveland-orchestra-unveils-bravo-the-badger-mascot-on-april-fools-day">&ldquo;Cleveland Orchestra unveils Bravo! The Badger mascot on April Fools&rsquo; Day&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/PgyPynW-EB0MlVDVRKCEHZU5I1A=/1280x0/smart/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width2048/img/musicdance_impact/photo/bravo-badger-rev5jpg-12030d79b7f8a72a.jpg" alt="img">
CLEVELAND, Ohio - The Browns have Brownie the Elf. The Cavs have Sir CC. The Indians, amidst debate, have Chief Wahoo.</p>
<p>Now, the Cleveland Orchestra has a mascot, too: Bravo! The Badger.</p>
<p>On Sunday, April Fools&rsquo; Day, the orchestra unveiled the new character that will serve as its emblem going forward. He&rsquo;s a grinning badger complete with all the trappings of the stereotypical classical music snob: monocle, top-hat, vest, overcoat, bow tie, Baroque wig and horn. About his neck dangles what appears to be a gold record, or phonograph.</p>
<p>The mascot, said chief brand officer Ross Binnie, &ldquo;embodies everything good about the Cleveland Orchestra and this terrific community&rdquo; of Northeast Ohio, especially now, in the midst of the orchestra&rsquo;s centennial season.</p>
<p>Dressed in finery, the badger, Binnie explained, models refinement and &ldquo;symbolizes a level of depth and passion for music that few other ensembles in the world today can match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time, Binnie added, Bravo! is a badger, a lowly, common creature more &ldquo;approachable&rdquo; than many other animals. In that sense, he said, the mascot also speaks to the orchestra&rsquo;s &ldquo;openness to share with anyone who cares to join us in our mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Top officials at the Cleveland Orchestra, including music director Franz Welser-Most, executive director Andre Gremillet and chief artistic officer Mark Williams, declined to comment. Musical Arts Association President Richard Smucker also was unavailable.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the group, however, reminded fans that Sunday is April Fools&rsquo; Day and that no pronouncements the orchestra makes on that day should be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Previous April Fools&rsquo; Day announcements have included the signing of an orchestra violist to the Cavaliers and the discovery of a vast system of caverns and underground waterways beneath Severance Hall.

<h3 id="dominos-the-pizza-that-never-sleeps">&ldquo;Domino&rsquo;s, the Pizza That Never Sleeps&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/static/b/theatlantic/img/lacroix-default-thumbnail.png" alt="img">
Still, it&rsquo;s entirely possible Domino&rsquo;s pizza has simply remained the kind of thing that you just think tastes good at 2 AM, when you&rsquo;ve been not-sleeping during a New York weekend and feel like being fed by an over-earnest corporation at an absurd hour. It almost doesn&rsquo;t matter, because it&rsquo;s very easy for Domino&rsquo;s to start feeling like a pal on those nights when you tumble drunk and alone into a taxi and realize that you need to eat, urgently. You leave a party in Chelsea or a venue in Williamsburg, stumble into a car in a pile of your own unraveling frippery, mess clumsily with your iPhone for two minutes, and have a pizza ready to take to bed by the time you get home.</p>
<p>There are times in the life of a harried urbanite that such a thing feels like no lesser miracle. It&rsquo;s some idea you bring home routinely until, in true New York City fashion, you realize you&rsquo;ve gotten a little attached to it.</p>
<p>The online ordering interface offers high design for the low-down. An utter lack of pretense and that impression of a meaningfully-earnest desire for approval pervades the entire site. There&rsquo;s a ladleful of quaintness: &ldquo;Awaiting your delicious selections,&rdquo; it promises underneath the &ldquo;My Order&rdquo; header. Popular items are placed front and center in case you have &ldquo;no time to waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can even build your own &ldquo;Pizza Profile&rdquo; so that Domino&rsquo;s will remember Your Location and Your Store. There are always coupons available so you can find the &ldquo;perfect hot online deal,&rdquo; and the Build Your Own Pizza utility promises you can &ldquo;watch the pizza of your wildest dreams come to life.&rdquo; And you can, through a visual simulation that lets you customize the amount and color of sauce, the density of your cheese, whether you place toppings only on half your pie or throughout.</p>
<p>It feels a little game-like, and it ought: in 2011, Domino&rsquo;s made waves with an iPad game called Domino&rsquo;s Pizza Hero, a complex touch-based simulation that challenged players to learn the demanding ropes of real pizza-making staffers. The game fits snugly among the kitchen sims popular on tablet devices, and aims to be genuinely-difficult &mdash;-to play it is to feel as if Domino&rsquo;s takes the craft of pizza-making incredibly seriously. It&rsquo;s also a subversive, avant-garde training and recruitment device where skilled players will be prompted to apply for jobs at their local franchise once their reward centers have been sufficiently flooded with a sense of success and importance.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the app allows you to submit the pizza you assemble in the game to your local franchise to be fulfilled as a proper order. As such, the company&rsquo;s use of game mechanics and social media has always felt admirably on-point, a success you kind of have to respect when you notice that most corporations have made a tacky mess of leveraging interactive entertainment and social media. Even beloved GrubHub made cynics of its consumers by wincingly offering up animal memes to consumers who lose its random-prize card game, and suggests recent orderers tweet &ldquo;I just got Grub&rsquo;d by the Hub.&rdquo;
