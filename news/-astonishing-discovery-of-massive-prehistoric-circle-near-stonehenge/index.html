<p>A team of archaeologists has discovered a massive ring of prehistoric trenches at the site of an ancient village about 1.9 miles (3 km) from the famous Stonehenge monument in the U.K. The team believes the circle of pits – carbon dated to about 2,500 B.C. – might have guided some people toward religious sites in the area, while warning others not to cross a boundary.</p>
<p>The find also makes the site the largest prehistoric structure in Britain and possibly in Europe. That’s according to University of Bradford archaeologist Vincent Gaffney, lead author of the analysis, which was published online on June 21, 2020 in the peer-reviewed, open-access journal Internet Archaeology. Bradford was quoted in a June 22 article at the New York Times:</p>
<p>It has completely transformed how we understand this landscape – there is no doubt about it.</p>
<p>The ring of shafts is 1.2 miles (2 km) wide, up to 33 feet (10 meters) across and 16 feet (5 meters) deep. It was discovered around a Neolithic village known as Durrington Walls, the site of a henge monument. Researchers have identified up to 20 shafts but estimate there may have been more than 30 originally.</p>
<p>Nick Snashall is National Trust archaeologist for the Stonehenge and Avebury World Heritage Site. She said:</p>
<p>As the place where the builders of Stonehenge lived and feasted, Durrington Walls is key to unlocking the story of the wider Stonehenge landscape, and this astonishing discovery offers us new insights into the lives and beliefs of our Neolithic ancestors.</p>
<p>Archaeologists believe the circle of shafts marks a boundary around the massive henge at Durrington. The features, along with an internal post line, might have guided some people toward religious sites in the area, while warning others not to cross a boundary. Gaffney told the New York Times:</p>
<p>Stonehenge was for the dead. Durrington was for the living. But now, what we are probably looking at was this great big boundary around them probably warning people of what they are approaching.</p>
<p>Gaffney said it was extraordinary that such a major find had been made so close to Stonehenge. He said in a statement:</p>
<p>The area around Stonehenge is among the most studied archaeological landscapes on Earth, and it is remarkable that the application of new technology can still lead to the discovery of such a massive prehistoric structure which, currently, is significantly larger than any comparative prehistoric monument that we know of in Britain, at least. When these pits were first noted, it was thought they might be natural features – solution hollows in the chalk. Only when the larger picture emerged, through the geophysical surveys undertaken as part of the Stonehenge Hidden Landscape Project, could we join the dots and see there was a pattern on a massive scale.</p>
<p>Gaffney said:</p>
<p>The size of the shafts and circuit surrounding Durrington Walls is without precedent within the UK. It demonstrates the significance of Durrington Walls Henge, the complexity of the monumental structures within the Stonehenge landscape, and the capacity and desire of Neolithic communities to record their cosmological belief systems in ways, and at a scale, that we had never previously anticipated.</p>
<p>The research on the pits at Durrington was undertaken by a consortium of archaeologists as part of the Stonehenge Hidden Landscape Project.</p>
<p>Bottom line: A team of archaeologists has discovered a massive ring of prehistoric trenches at the site of an ancient village about 2 miles from the famous Stonehenge monument in the U.K.</p>

<p>What could be one of the largest prehistoric sites in the UK has been discovered near Stonehenge by a consortium of archaeologists led by the University of Bradford.</p>
<p>A massive 2km-wide ring of prehistoric &lsquo;shafts&rsquo; up to 10m across and 5m deep has been discovered around the &lsquo;super henge&rsquo; at Durrington Walls and the famous site at Woodhenge. The structures have been carbon dated to about 2500BC.</p>

<h3 id="how-illuminating---measuring-luminescence-helps-to-date-a-remarkable-new-discovery-at-stonehenge">&ldquo;How illuminating - Measuring luminescence helps to date a remarkable new discovery at Stonehenge&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20200711_STP001.jpg" alt="img">
F OR MORE than 4,000 years Stonehenge has stood on Salisbury Plain in southern Britain. The landscape surrounding the Neolithic monument contains many secrets, with features dating back to much earlier times. Having surveyed more than 18 square kilometres in the vicinity, archaeologists continue to make surprising discoveries. The latest, a series of deep pits forming a vast circle more than two kilometres in diameter, shows how technology makes it possible to peer even further back into time.</p>
<p>Along with their shovels, trowels and brushes, archaeologists have put together a toolbox of new technologies. Using magnetometers, which can detect how different materials in the ground cause slight changes in Earth’s magnetic field, they found a series of anomalies forming circular disturbances in the ground on a broad arch around Durrington Walls, the remains of another large henge three kilometres north-east of Stonehenge. These were thought to be old filled-in ponds.</p>
<p>But ground-penetrating radar, another archaeological tool, raised questions about that notion. This technique, which reflects radio waves off underground structures, showed that far from being shallow, as ponds would have been, the anomalous features had deep vertical sides. They were some ten metres across and five metres or more deep. Up to 20 shafts were identified, but there may have been 30 or more as some of the land is now covered by buildings and roads. The archaeologists thought it was time to take a closer look with more high-tech tools.</p>
<p>Vince Gaffney of the University of Bradford and a team of researchers from Britain, Austria, Sweden and Norway, drilled into three of the sites to extract core samples. Fragments of shell and bone were found. As these fragments are organic materials containing carbon, they could be subjected to radiocarbon dating. This measures the presence of carbon-14, a mildly radioactive isotope created naturally in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. As this element decays, older samples have less carbon-14 in them than modern ones, and because the rate of radioactive decay is predictable, a date for the sample can be calculated.</p>
<p>The dates, though, varied widely; up to 6000 BC for some of the shells and around 1300 BC for some bones. Moreover, if a pit had been gradually filled in over the years, older material would have appeared at the bottom and younger material near the top. But some of the dates were inverted, showing older material near the top.</p>
<p>To work out what might have gone on, the archaeologists reached for one of their newest tools: optically stimulated luminescence ( OSL ). This measures when fragments of rocks made of quartz or feldspar, two of the world’s most common groups of minerals, were last exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>The OSL process can be likened to measuring the power in a rechargeable battery, explains Tim Kinnaird, who tested the samples from the shafts at his lab at the University of St Andrews. When quartz and feldspar are removed from sunlight and buried, electrons start to accumulate in defects in their crystal structures from exposure, in the ground, to low levels of environmental radiation. When the minerals are re-exposed to the outside world, the electrons are stimulated with enough energy to escape their traps and they go on to release photons of light. As the intensity of this luminescence is directly proportional to the amount of environmental radiation absorbed by the minerals, this can be used to work out when they were last exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>As they report in Internet Archaeology, the OSL analysis allowed the researchers to put the various radiocarbon dates and the different layers in their core samples into some context. The shells were considered outliers, as they probably contained material from earlier times. The inverted dates seemed to be caused by later earthworks, which might have exposed minerals to light and reset their timeclocks. One pit appears to have been recut in the Bronze Age. But there was enough of a reliable sample to date the pits to around 2500 BC, which means they would have been dug by the same people who built Stonehenge.</p>
<p>What purpose the pits served remains speculation. They would have required a massive effort to build, with tools made from stone, wood and bone. They may have been boundary markers, possibly containing large totem-like poles. Henges have cosmological significance and some think Stonehenge was a site for the dead while Durrington Walls, which had wooden structures, was a site for the living. The archaeologists hope to open up trenches throughout the pits to discover more.</p>

<h3 id="archaeologists-discover-giant-neolithic-circle-of-shafts-near-stonehenge">&ldquo;Archaeologists discover giant Neolithic circle of shafts near Stonehenge&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dw.com/image/53895122_304.jpg" alt="img">
Archaeologists have found a wide circle of deep shaft surrounding an ancient settlement near the Stonehenge world heritage site, describing it as the biggest prehistoric structure ever found in the UK.</p>
<p>The site is located approximately 2 miles (roughly 3 kilometers) northeast of Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain. Evidence suggests the shafts date back to the same period, some 4,500 years ago.</p>
<p>A team of archaeologists from multiple universities announced on Monday the discovery of the circle of shafts, describing it as a masterpiece of engineering. The prehistoric structure, spanning 1.2 miles (2 km) in diameter, each about 10 meters (33 feet) wide and 5 meters deep, surrounds the settlement of Durrington Walls.</p>
<p>The red dots are discovered shafts and the plotted circle estimates how they might have been arranged around Durrington Walls</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an unprecedented find of major significance within the UK,&rdquo; said Vincent Gaffney, a leading archaeologist on the project. &ldquo;Key researchers on Stonehenge and its landscape have been taken aback by the scale of the structure and the fact that it hadn&rsquo;t been discovered until now so close to Stonehenge,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>No need for excavations</p>
<p>Using remote sensing technology and sampling, archaeologists were able to make the discovery without the need for excavations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t emphasize enough the effort that would have gone into digging such large shafts with tools of stone, wood and bone,&rdquo; said Gaffney. &ldquo;We are starting to see things we could never see through standard archaeology, things we could not imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the archaeologist said that around 20 shafts had been found but that there may have been more than 30. About 40% of the circle is no longer available for study as a consequence of modern development, he explained.</p>

<p>Recording cosmological beliefs</p>
<p>The archaeologists said the &ldquo;astonishing&rdquo; circle of shafts revealed the desire of Neolithic communities to record their belief systems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It demonstrates the significance of Durrington Walls Henge, the complexity of the monumental structures within the Stonehenge landscape, and the capacity and desire of Neolithic communities to record their cosmological belief systems in ways, and at a scale, that we had never previously anticipated,&rdquo; Gaffney said.</p>
<p>An artist&rsquo;s impression of what the Durrington Walls might have looked like; the shafts discovered appear to form a giant ring around the structure</p>
<p>The archaeologist from the University of Bradford added that the planning involved in contracting a prehistoric structure of this magnitude must have involved a tally or counting system. He said the discovery is all the more extraordinary because it offers the first evidence that the early inhabitants of the UK, mainly agricultural communities, had developed a counting system.</p>
<p>The mysterious Stonehenge — whose purpose still remains unknown today despite decades of research — is one the UK&rsquo;s most famous landmarks, attracting both tourists and those in search of spiritual connections with nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stonehenge has a clear link to the seasons and the passage of time, through the summer solstice. But with the Durrington Shafts, it&rsquo;s not the passing of time, but the bounding by a circle of shafts which has cosmological significance,&rdquo; Gaffney said.</p>
<p>Stonehenge remained closed, as a result of coronavirus, this past Sunday — the summer solstice — forcing people to conduct their annual rituals there at a larger remove than usual</p>
<p>The area surrounding Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain is awash with other sites of apparent importance to ancient British civilizations, such as large long barrows and Durrington Walls, as well as later Iron Age hillforts like Silbury Hill. Not far away, also in Wiltshire, the village of Avebury contains what&rsquo;s thought to be the largest megalithic stone circle in Britain.

Pulling together a professional photo competition is a massive challenge on its own. Doing it in the midst of a global coronavirus pandemic, even more so.</p>
<p>Still, from across the nation and around the world, almost 500 entries made their way into Montgomery for SAC’s and Stonehenge Gallery’s 2nd annual Photography Competition and Exhibit this year.</p>
<p>Richard Metzger, gallery director for Stonehenge, 401 Cloverdale Road, said this year’s call for entries went live in mid-February. Everything was going as planned, until the virus struck in Alabama by the end of March. After several discussions, it was decided they were too far along to not hold it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good thing they didn&rsquo;t cancel.</p>
<p>By May 4, they’d received 499 images from 176 photographers - from 26 states and seven other countries.</p>
<p>The person who faced and overcame the difficult task of picking 50 images from them in just 30 days, and from that the 5 best photos, is Angie Dodson, director of the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts.</p>
<p>During the judging process, Dodson said it helped to think of the work in the four categories: color, black &amp; white, manipulated and alternative process. Those that made the cut somehow transcended their media, subject matter, style and influences. She said they were somehow more than the sum of their parts.</p>
<p>The one that exemplified that idea the most to win Best in Show was “Duality” (from the series “Only Child”) by K.K. DePaul of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“Abstraction figured prominently, as did natural subjects,” Dodson said. &ldquo;Some of that is my eye, my preference. Some of that is more than me - when the quality of the work was simply undeniable.”</p>
<p>Best in Color was awarded to one of Montgomery’s own photographers, Elmore DeMott for “Flowers for Mom, vol. IV Nov. 5.” It is part of her four-year flower-a-day series in honor of her mother&rsquo;s Alzheimer&rsquo;s journey. The series is also a celebration of nature, she said.</p>
<p>Her image for the competition was of a seedpod she found in the woods and took home during a November walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lit that on my kitchen counter to get that photograph,&rdquo; DeMott said. &ldquo;I love its texture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the other individual categories:</p>
<p>Best in Black &amp; White went to “Old Soul,” by Decatur, Georgia photographer Joey Potter.</p>
<p>Best in Manipulation was awarded to “Storm Over The Desert,” by Donna Dangott from College Station, Texas.</p>
<p>Best in Alternative Process went to an international photographer, Gerardo Stübing of Valencia, Spain, for his “Scabiosa Atropurpurea.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;That they succeeded in getting such top quality work from around the world to submit for this show is really something,&rdquo; said DeMott.</p>
<p>These five, and 42 others selected by Dodson, are on display now at Stonehenge. Three of the other photographers were unable to send their images in for the exhibit at Stonehenge, which opened July 10 and will run through July 31.</p>
<p>“Knowing the work would - pandemic-allowing - be shown as a whole, I couldn’t help but think about relationships between the works - how great the image of the spherical structure would look near the abstract circle with stitching near the image of the dam’s row of round portals; how the two stairwell shots might be hung in relationship with one another,” Dodson said. “That also influenced the selections, though, with the number of entries, the work had to have outstanding individual merit as well.”</p>
<p>The competition and exhibition was produced by the local Nine Photography Group, which did the same for last year’s event.</p>
<p>SAC’s Gallery (Society of Arts &amp; Crafts) is a 501(c) 3 nonprofit, committed to advancement or art education and art appreciation for all ages and stages of life.</p>
<p>Stonehenge celebrated its 50th anniversary in February.</p>
<p>Metzger said they are grateful to the National Endowment for the Arts and the Alabama State Council on the Arts for their support.</p>
<p>“In the end, the work shows the world something of Montgomery’s most talented artists… and shows Montgomery something of the diversity of skill found &lsquo;round the globe,” Dodson said.</p>

<h3 id="new-stonehenge-discovery-how-we-found-a-prehistoric-monument-hidden-in-data">&ldquo;New Stonehenge discovery: how we found a prehistoric monument hidden in data&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/344276/original/file-20200626-104522-1ehafw4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1356&amp;h=668&amp;fit=crop" alt="img">
The chances of finding another major archaeological monument near Stonehenge today are probably very small given the generations of work that has gone into studying the site. Stumbling across such a monument that measured more than 2km across must be highly unlikely. And yet that is exactly what our team from the Anglo-Austrian “Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes” research project has done.</p>
<p>We discovered a circle of pits, each ten metres or more in diameter and at least five metres deep, around Stonehenge’s largest prehistoric neighbour, the so-called super henge at Durrington Walls. More amazingly, the initial evidence for this discovery was hidden away in terabytes of remote sensing data and reams of unpublished literature generated by archaeologists over the years.</p>
<p>Durrington is one of Britain’s largest neolithic monuments. Comprising banks and ditches measuring 500 metres across, the henge was constructed over 4,500 years ago by early farmers, around the time that Stonehenge achieved it’s final, distinctive form. The site itself overlies what may have been one of north west Europe’s largest neolithic villages. Researchers suggest that the communities that built Stonehenge lived here.</p>

<p>Over the last decade, there has been a quiet revolution in the landscape around Stonehenge as archaeologists have gained access to enhanced remote sensing technologies. Around 18 sq km of landscape around Stonehenge has now been surveyed through geophysics. Now archaeologists are joining the dots within these enormous data set, and making associations they might not have done otherwise.</p>
<p>The first geophysical anomalies related to our new discovery were recorded (but not published) some years ago when a small number of peculiar circular splodges in the magnetometry data south of Durrington. These were initially interpreted as shallower features, possibly dew ponds, unlinked to the henge. But our research group realised that similar features had been recorded far to the north of the henge by archaeological contractors, interpreted as natural sink holes caused by solution of the chalk bedrock.</p>

<p>Our mapping work suggested all these features were actually linked and part of a single, massive circuit surrounding the henge monument at Durrington. Detailed study, including drilling for underground samples, revealed the anomalies as massive pits, with near vertical sides, containing worked flint and bone. Radiocarbon dating suggested the features were from the same time as the henge.</p>
<p>Shafts and pits are known in prehistoric British archaeology, but the sheer number of massive pits and the scale of the Durrington circuit is unparalleled in the UK. The internal area of the ring is likely to be at least around three sq km. This arrangement of pits certainly gives the impression they bound an important space, and here there may be a comparison to be made with Stonehenge itself.</p>
<p>Stonehenge actually has a territory sometimes called the “Stonehenge Envelope”. This is marked by lines of later burial mounds clustering around the monument, covering an area similar to that of Durrington Walls. The space is marked so clearly that archaeologists have suggested only a special few people may have been allowed to enter the area.</p>
<p>This association of Stonehenge with death and burial has also led to interpretations that it was reserved for ancestors. Durrington, in contrast, is believed to be associated with the living. But our discovery of the pits suggest that Durrington did have a similar special outer area, as large as that associated with Stonehenge.</p>
<p>The pit circle also provide insights into the mindset of the people who built these massive structures. The pits appear to be laid out to include a much earlier monument: the Larkhill causewayed enclosure.</p>
<p>Vincent Gaffney , Author provided</p>
<p>Built more than 1,000 years before the Durrington Walls henge, such ditched enclosures were the first large communal constructions in Britain and they were clearly important to early farming communities. The decision to appropriate this earlier monument into the circuit of the henge must have been a deliberate, symbolic statement.</p>
<p>In fact, the pits appear to have been laid out in a notional circle so that they were all the same walking distance from the henge as the causewayed enclosure. Given the scale involved and the shape of the landscape, which includes several valleys, this would have been difficult to achieve without the existence of a tally or counting system. This is the first evidence that such a system may have been used by neolithic people to lay out what must be considered a sacred geometry, at the scale suggested by the Durrington pits.</p>
<p>The unexpected discovery of a unique set of massive pits within the Stonehenge landscape may also have implications in terms of the site’s management. There are similar individual features scattered throughout the landscape that are unexplored but may be of equal significance. Yet a proposed road (the A303) development includes a road tunnel that will pass close to the iconic site of Stonehenge itself and impact a large corridor of land directly associated with the site.</p>
<p>The issue of value is complex when we’re discussing a period of history in which the digging of pits clearly had a multitude of social values. We would do well to consider the implication of such discoveries before a tragic loss ensues. Future generations are unlikely to forgive us if we damage this unique landscape.
