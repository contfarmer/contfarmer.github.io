<p>PUNS AND ANAGRAMS — It’s nice to see Mel Taub in this space again, for the first time in over a year! We’ve had some fun “Pandas” from the kiddos, but Mr. Taub brings an unmistakably masterful touch to this interesting genre. Today’s puzzle has a lot of flair, a nice range of pun types and word “schtick,” to quote this constructor (from an interview I read very recently). Solvers should still find it approachable.</p>
<p>I always give out the anagrams first, because they can be solved without explanation for the most part, and because they often provide letter hints to the puns that complete the grid — they’re fill, in other words. A skillful constructor can make fill pleasing, and I like Mr. Taub’s anagrams. They’re clean. Look at 14A, “A lot seem to be eaten at brunch,” or OMELETS; consider 2D, “Cowboys throw them at liars,” or LARIATS. They just work nicely, in my opinion, and make the solve fun. Some other examples include LAMENTED, NOMADIC, STINGER and YES AND NO; there was one, STATORS, that was a new term to me that I needed crosses to confirm (it was common crossword fill in the 20th century as “parts of motors,” and I should have known it). TENACES was only known to me via crosswords, too, in all honesty. If you’re stumped by an entry and it’s not explicated here, it’s safe to assume that it’s an anagram.</p>
<p>As far as the puns and “schtick,” let’s look at the varieties, starting with some of the simpler ones and working to the complex.</p>
<p>One auditory pun struck me at 18A, “The heavenly Hunter O’Ryan, say,” which was quite simple if you know your basic constellations and recognize that “say” is one of several cues for a solver to consider the sound of a word. “O’Ryan,” you say? Oh, I see — ORION. HALE was another example of this type of entry. PUT was clever, as long as you know to make “tepee” equal T and P, and “you” become U, all common tricks in these puzzles. DAMASK was a listener entry, as were ABUT and LENA. As long as you knew LAIT is French milk, this entry also fit in this category.

<h3 id="squeaking-across-the-line-for-the-olympic-marathon-trials">&ldquo;Squeaking Across the Line for the Olympic Marathon Trials&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/14/well/14run-nl/14run-nl-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Adkins, 25, an occupational therapist from Colorado Springs, played soccer growing up and ran for her high school track and cross-country teams, but said she didn’t take it too seriously. She walked onto the University of Southern Indiana track team and ran in one national championship, in her senior year: the 10,000 meters at the 2016 N.C.A.A. Division II Outdoor Track &amp; Field Championships, where she finished 12th.</p>
<p>Adkins expected that to be it for her running career, but then realized that there were still ways she could be competitive. She ran the 2017 Indianapolis Monumental Marathon in two hours, 59 minutes, seven seconds. When she moved to Colorado, she thought she was “going to be done with competitive running and do other things, like rock climb and hike and camp.”</p>
<p>But she met a group of fast runners through the Colorado Running Company, a running store in Colorado Springs. “They talked me into trying to actually train for the Boston Marathon instead of just running it,” she said. She trained with a group of the women who were aiming to make the 2:45 Olympic trial qualifying standard but caught strep throat a week before the 2019 Boston Marathon and finished in just over three hours.</p>
<p>She got talked into trying again by her friends and her boyfriend, and signed up late for the California marathon, known as CIM. That meant she missed getting an elite runner bib, and the 2:45 pace group was for runners with elite starts only. Instead, Adkins lined up with the general runner crowd, about 10 seconds behind the elite women’s pack (that’s why her chip time, which measures from when she crossed the starting line herself to her finish, is two hours, 44 minutes, 48 seconds). Only gun time — the time the race starts, not the moment you cross the start line — is considered valid for qualifying purposes.</p>
<p>“It was quite easy to find just a massive pack of girls all running in sync,” she said.</p>
<p>Her plan was “to just hang onto that group,” she said. “At about mile 23, I thought, ‘Oh man, this is where it hurts.’” At that point, the group that was still in the hunt to qualify for the Olympic marathon trials started to break apart.

<h3 id="theres-no-respite-from-a-squeaky-bed">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no respite from a squeaky bed&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/U7OPF7F4NMI6TKFQP3MKBVO4LU.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
Every time our daughters come home for a visit and sleep in that room, they claim the brass bed’s tubular metal frame is so squeaky that the cacophony that erupts when they roll over is loud enough to wake them. You’ve got to replace that bed, they say.</p>
<p>A lot of my success as a parent has come from ignoring the gripes of my children. And I fully intended to do that in this case. A squeaky bed? Too bad. When I was a kid, I slept in a manger, an anvil for a pillow, a mat of bark and fire ants for a blanket.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>But the older they get, the harder it is to just blow them off. There comes a point in every parent’s life when you realize that though you created your offspring, they are their own people, with their own likes, dislikes and viewpoints.</p>
<p>This is amusing at first: a toddler with an opinion! Then you wonder what sort of free-will-wielding monster you created.</p>
<p>Well, this kind of monster: When our bed-frame-dissing daughters came to visit last month, oat milk suddenly materialized in our refrigerator.</p>
<p>“Get that stuff out of there,” I wanted to say. “It makes the regular milk nervous.”</p>
<p>Where do these formerly helpless infants get off bringing oat milk into our home, telling us we should be drinking it instead of cow’s milk, telling us we should be drinking matcha instead of coffee and eating Impossible Burgers instead of possible — probable! — burgers?</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>They come into my house and load the dishwasher in a foreign fashion, with the plates there and the bowls here, rather than the plates here and the bowls there.</p>
<p>And they have the gall to criticize the double bed.</p>
<p>We bought it when we finally became empty-nesters, after the girls moved out and we gave away their single beds and transformed their bedroom — the one they took turns having as their own as they grew up — into a room for guests, which, let’s face it, kids, is what you are now: guests.</p>
<p>Your posters are gone from the walls, your clothes from the closet, your books from the shelves. Your gel pens, your Tamagotchis, your Beanie Babies: gone, all gone — off to Goodwill or stuffed in a box in the attic marked “Fifth Grade.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Frankly, neither one of the girls — women — minds that much. They’re not overly sentimental. They like being adults (I mean, as much as any of us do). They don’t pine for the old. They do, however, have plenty to say about the new, about the Ikea bed frame — a Skweek, I think it is, or a Grøaner. They say it’s basically a large set of horizontal wind chimes, sounding off annoyingly at the slightest wriggle.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>When they came to visit last month, they couldn’t decide who had it worse: the sister who had to sleep in the creaking bed or the sister who had to sleep on the floor atop an inflatable air mattress.</p>
<p>Despite the kvetching, it was lovely to see them both. One night, about a week after they had returned to their respective cities and their respective lives, My Lovely Wife and I put on our pajamas, grabbed our pillows and entered the room that had once been theirs. We had never actually slept in the guest bed ourselves. We were like paranormal investigators determined to spend the night in a haunted house to prove — or disprove — the existence of ghosts.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>We threw back the sheets, slid into bed and settled in for a good night’s sleep.</p>
<p>Or tried to. I’ve been trying to decide how to describe the noise that cursed bed made every time one of us moved a muscle. “Collapsing gantry” probably comes closest. Or “jackknifed plumbing supply truck.” Maybe “cutlery drawer tipped onto concrete floor.” Or “anchor chain dragged across galvanized sheeting.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Anyway, we’re shopping for a new bed. You were right, girls. I’m sorry I ever doubted you.

<p><img src="https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/zwbn51w7oMpQdG2vA9UXGEUNoVI=/506x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-bostonglobe.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4P4YEPCHBUI6VG3UDEHR2U2VGA.jpg" alt="img">
“Have you ever seen the movie ‘Major League’?” Stevens said later, referring to the 1989 film about a group of baseball misfits who can’t do anything right. “We pitched like Ricky Vaughn that whole quarter . . . At least we got a laugh out of it. I don’t know. We just threw it all over the place. I feel we should apologize to all the fans sitting around the bleachers.”</p>
<p>But these were not plays that he wanted to remember, and they certainly were not meant for a highlight reel. Instead, they just provided some unintentional levity after the 123-115 win.</p>
<p>ATLANTA — After the Celtics’ game against the Hawks was complete Monday, coach Brad Stevens retreated to his office in the visitor’s locker room and watched a collection of fourth-quarter clips that one of his assistants had compiled.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>It was easy to chuckle about the fumbling and bumbling since the night still ended with a win, but it certainly was not pretty.</p>
<p>There was Javonte Green driving and whipping a behind-the-back pass to nowhere. There was Gordon Hayward having his pass batted down and recovered by Grant Williams, who promptly hurled a crosscourt offering into the front row. There were others, and they probably could have been accompanied by a laugh track.</p>
<p>Observations from the Celtics’ fourth-straight win</p>
<p>Boston committed 10 fourth-quarter turnovers in all, and for a brief moment looked as if it would allow a 13-point lead to vanish. But it helped that the Celtics were playing the 13-win Hawks, and it also helped that when they actually held onto the ball long enough to shoot it, those shots usually went in.</p>
<p>“It was ugly, but we figured it out,” Jaylen Brown said. “We made a lot of mistakes, but we made less mistakes than they did, so we won.</p>

<p>“As we inch toward the playoffs, we’ve got to clean up habits and do a better job. We can’t just take plays off or shoot bad shots because we’re playing against Atlanta. We’ve got to continue to play the game the right way.”</p>

<p>The Celtics should not turn the ball over 10 times over a 12-minute span, regardless of their personnel. But this was not the group they intend to have when games truly matter.</p>
<p>All-Star point guard Kemba Walker sat out because of a sore knee, guard Marcus Smart was sidelined with a thigh contusion, Enes Kanter’s playing time was limited in his first game back from a hip contusion, and Daniel Theis suffered a third-quarter ankle injury and did not return.</p>
<p>Theis’s scare looked like the most important moment of this night. The center landed awkwardly, rolled his right ankle, and stayed on the ground in pain as play continued to the other end. He was eventually helped to the locker room by two medical staffers.</p>
<p>Theis was also hit in the face on his fall, but after undergoing concussion tests and X-rays, he was diagnosed with a sprained ankle and was actually cleared to return to the game, if needed.</p>
<p>“When I walked out, I was ready to go back in, but the other guys were playing well,” Theis said. “Then, at one point, I was sitting and it got cold and a little stiff and I said, ‘All right, I can’t go back in.’ Because if I get cold and can’t move the right way, I can’t help the team.”</p>

<p>Theis said he is hopeful that he will be able to face the Magic on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tatum led the Celtics with 28 points and seven rebounds. But if things had unfolded a bit differently, his game would have been remembered for a gaffe, the ninth turnover of Boston’s sordid spree.</p>
<p>Tatum pushed upcourt on a fast break with just 1:32 left and Boston leading, 117-111. If he attacked for a layup or even just pulled the ball out and let time tick away, Atlanta’s hopes would have mostly been dashed. Instead, he lofted an ill-advised alley-oop pass to Brown that thudded off the backboard.</p>
<p>Atlanta’s John Collins quickly scored at the other end to slice the Hawks’ deficit to 4. After yet another turnover, this one by Brad Wanamaker, the Hawks had a chance to pounce. This time, however, the Celtics forced a turnover instead of committing one, as Brown tipped a Trae Young pass, and Williams scored at the other end as the shot clock neared its expiration.</p>
<p>Stevens was asked how his team had won despite the sloppy mess that was its fourth quarter.</p>
<p>“Not sure,” he said. “I don’t think throwing the ball all over the gym is a good recipe to win. But we fought, we made some tough plays, we made some timely plays, and I thought we got a lot of good contributions from a lot of people.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Hayward had 24 points and Brown added 21, but the more important lifts came from the bench. Wanamaker finished with 16 points and five assists and Williams added 13 points and six rebounds, while also playing some sound defense when matched up against Young, the Hawks’ All-Star.</p>
<p>Young blitzed the Celtics with a 17-point opening quarter that included one 3-pointer from about 5 feet inside midcourt.</p>
<p>But Boston did a better job corralling him after that, holding him to 17 more for the rest of the game.</p>
<p>“He was hitting from really far out, and I think for some reason that surprised us, like we hadn’t seen him do it before,” Hayward said. “But I think we made a better effort to force him over the top and try to just be up a little bit more, to be honest.”</p>
<p>Despite their ugly fourth quarter, the Celtics committed just five turnovers up to that point. And they made 53.3 percent of their shots overall and 41.4 percent of their 3-pointers.</p>

<h3 id="tablighi-the-wire-calls-crossword-puzzle-by-dainik-bhaskar-communal">&ldquo;Tablighi: The Wire calls crossword puzzle by Dainik Bhaskar &lsquo;communal&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Wire-Tablighi-Jamaat.jpg?fit=900%2C600&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
The Tablighi Jamaat has emerged as a superspreader in India. Cases linked to the Islamic missionary have popped up across the country. Furthermore, they have engaged in despicable conduct with the healthcare staff attending to them. Even so, there have been dedicated attempts made to whitewash the deeds of the Islamic missionary organization. The latest to join the fray is Leftist rag The Wire run by an American citizen, Siddarth Varadarajan, and Newslaundry. At the heart of it is a crossword puzzle. On the 7th of April, one of the most popular Hindi dailies, Dainik Bhaskar, offered its readers a crossword puzzle to solve.</p>
<p>The questions of the crossword puzzle revolved around the Tablighi Jamaat and its role in spreading the Wuhan Coronavirus. However, The Wire accused the Hindi Daily of attempting to ‘communalize’ the pandemic for basing its puzzle around the facts of the pandemic in India. As per the far-left propagandist website, “The clues to the crossword are loaded to criticise the Tablighi Jamaat and praise PM Narendra Modi.”</p>
<p>Source: The Wire</p>
<p>Propagandists at The Wire stated, “If you thought solving puzzles could be fun during the lockdown, Dainik Bhaskar, one of the biggest Hindi dailies, has other plans for you. In an attempt to further communalise the coronavirus pandemic in India, the daily published a crossword on April 7 that amplified the role of Tablighi Jamaat’s cluster and also heaped praise on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.”</p>
<p>Newslaundry published a similar report on the crossword puzzle. However, it refrained from making any editorial remarks in its report, probably aware that they were clutching at straws in the report. The far-left rag only reproduced the crossword puzzle with the addition of minor information. It said that the daily’s editions for Haryana, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Chandigarh and New Delhi carried the “corona crossword” and that it did not appear in the Rajasthan editions of the paper, in cities like Jaipur, Alwar, Sikar, Jodhpur and Kota.</p>
<p>Source: Newslaundry</p>
<p>The questions of the crossword puzzle included questions such as “Which association’s negligence led to a surge in coronavirus cases in the country? (4,3)”, “Who is the head of the Islamic association in Delhi that gathers thousands of people? (3,2)”, “The reason for fewer coronavirus cases in our country is the _ solutions taken by our government. (3)”, “Our prime minister has made _ attempts to not break the morale of our countrymen. (4)” and “Which building in Delhi was sealed after a gathering of thousands of people?”</p>
<p>It was quite obvious that the Dainik Bhaskar based its crossword puzzle on the contribution of Tablighi Jamaat to the spreading of the Wuhan Coronavirus across the country. However, for basing the crossword puzzle on facts and actual events, The Wire has accused it of ‘communalizing’ the issue. The Wire has been at the forefront of making the baseless assertion that criticism of the Tablighi Jamaat is aking to spreading hate against the entire Muslim community. It once again demonstrated its flawed conception of reality in the report on Dainik Bhaskar’s crossword puzzles.</p>
<p>Ever since Tablighi Jamaat’s contribution to the Wuhan Coronavirus pandemic emerged, numerous attempts have been made to downplay and whitewash their malicious conduct. A former journalist from Kapil Sibal’s Tiranga TV asserted that she refused to believe that the spurt in Coronavirus cases was due to the Islamic missionary organization and accused the central and state governments of engaging in a conspiracy to save their own face using the Markaz Nizamuddin incident.</p>
<p>A columnist from the Wall Street Journal had claimed that the allegations of sexual harassment levelled against members of the Tablighi Jamaat by nurses at a hospital, which included roaming around the hospital naked and making lewd gestures at the female staff, ‘ring false’ because they are Islamic conservatives. The Wire journalist Arfa Khanum Sherwani, too, accused the nurses of lying and call the sexually predatory behaviour of the Tablighi Jamaat members ‘propaganda’.

Vancouver, with its snowcapped mountains and sleek, squeaky-clean downtown can seem to a new visitor to be lacking in urban grit. Which is exactly why for Sara Harowitz, a Vancouver native, the once blue-collar district of Hastings-Sunrise has so much appeal. Today, the area is a mix of on-trend eateries and boutiques as well as mainstays from its humbler days, and Ms. Harowitz loves the variety. “It’s unpolished, it’s working class, it’s a real Vancouver neighborhood,” says Ms. Harowitz, who edits the online lifestyle journal Basenotes, which explores wellness and female-centric travel, beauty and sustainability.</p>

<p>For the past three years, she has rented the top floor of a cozy house in the area with her long-term boyfriend, a craft brewer. “There are places that are opening that are trendy and design-forward, but it hasn’t lost the Polish sausage place and the local market. It feels like home.” Here are her top Vancouver spots.ᐧ</p>

<li>East Cafe</li>
</ol>
<p>There are trendier java joints in Hastings-Sunrise, but East Cafe, with its homey décor, laid-back baristas and commitment to pulling perfect shots from its vintage turquoise espresso machine, is where Ms. Harowitz prefers to get her caffeine fix. “It’s unpretentious and cozy,” she says. “I love places that are design-forward but I also love a place where I walk in and it just is what it is.”</p>
