<p>Gunmen have killed six French aid workers, a Nigerien guide and a driver in a wildlife park in Niger, according to officials in the West African country.</p>
<p>The group was attacked on Sunday in a giraffe reserve near Koure, a town about 65km (40 miles) from the capital, Niamey. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were intercepted and killed,&rdquo; Tidjani Ibrahim Katiella, the governor of Tillaberi region, told Reuters news agency.</p>
<p>The six worked for an international aid group, Niger&rsquo;s Defence Minister Issoufou Katambe told Reuters. ACTED, an aid group, confirmed its staff members were targeted in the attack.</p>
<p>Officials had earlier described the French nationals as tourists. The reserve is a popular attraction in Niger.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Association of Koure Giraffe Reserve Guides described the attackers as a &ldquo;unit of terrorists&rdquo; and said the dead included its president, Kadri Abdou.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They came on motorcycles&rsquo;</p>
<p>France&rsquo;s TF1 television channel, meanwhile, broadcast images that it said were taken from the scene showing the burnt-out remains of a 4x4 vehicle with bullet holes in the side.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron&rsquo;s office earlier confirmed French nationals had been killed in Niger, without providing any additional details. It said Macron spoke on the phone with Niger&rsquo;s President Mahamadou Issoufou.</p>
<p>A source close to Niger&rsquo;s environmental services said the assault took place around 11:30am (10:30 GMT).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of the victims were shot &hellip; We found a magazine emptied of its cartridges at the scene,&rdquo; the source told AFP news agency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not know the identity of the attackers but they came on motorcycles through the bush and waited for the arrival of the tourists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fighters with links to al-Qaeda and the ISIL (ISIS) group have increasingly mounted attacks across West Africa&rsquo;s Sahel region in recent years despite the presence of thousands of regional and foreign troops.</p>
<p>The violence has hit Mali and Burkina Faso the hardest, rendering large swaths of those countries ungovernable, but it has also spilled into Niger, which shares long and porous borders with its two neighbours.</p>
<p>France, a former colonial power in the region, has deployed thousands of troops in the arid region south of the Sahara desert since 2013 but violence has been on the rise.

<p>Gunmen have attacked a group of aid workers in Niger, killing six French citizens, their local guide and driver, officials say.</p>
<p>The gunmen arrived on motorcycles and opened fire, the governor of Tillab√©ri region, Tidjani Ibrahim, told the French news agency AFP.</p>
<p>They were in the Koure region, which attracts tourists who want to see the last herds of giraffe in West Africa.</p>
<p>The French presidency confirmed the deaths of the French citizens.</p>
<p>The French nationals worked for an international aid group, Niger&rsquo;s defence minister Issoufou Katamb√© told Reuters news agency. Earlier, officials had described them as tourists.</p>
<p>ACTED, a French humanitarian NGO, confirmed its staff members were involved in the incident in Niger.</p>
<p>President Emmanuel Macron spoke on the phone with his Niger counterpart Mahamadou Issoufou on Sunday, a statement said, without giving further details.</p>
<p>In photos seen by the BBC, the victims&rsquo; bodies were found lying on a dirt road by the side of a 4x4 vehicle.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Despite the dangers, tourists head to Koure to see the only giraffes left in West Africa</p>
<p>The vehicle appeared to have been burned out.</p>
<p>The attack happened at around 11:30 local time (10:30 GMT), east of Koure, about hour&rsquo;s drive from the capital Niamey, AFP reported.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear who was behind the attack, but jihadist groups have become increasingly active in Niger.</p>
<p>The French government advises against travel to large parts of Niger, a former French colony.</p>
<p>The threat of terrorism, in particular outside the capital Niamey and near the borders, is high, the French government says.</p>
<p>Militant groups, including Boko Haram, operate in the area and violence by groups linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group has been on the rise in the Sahel region.</p>
<p>France has been leading a coalition of West African and European allies against Islamist militants in the region since June.</p>
<p>Despite this, tourists still visit to see the Niger giraffes, a sub-species distinguished by its lighter colour.</p>
<p>They settled in the area around 20 years ago and have been largely protected from poachers.</p>
<p>The Koure Giraffe Reserve, around 65 km (40 miles) south east of the capital Niamey, draws many tourists.

Jihadist militants on motorcycles killed six French aid workers and their local guide and driver in a giraffe park in Niger on Sunday, according to government officials, the latest attack in a nation hailed by western nations as a bulwark against a rising tide of Islamist militancy across West Africa.</p>
<p>The ambush began shortly after 10 a.m., when the French nationals‚Äô tour group entered the Kour√© Giraffe Reserve, some 40 miles east of the capital, Niamey, according to senior interior ministry officials and the governor of Tillaberi&hellip;

<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/09/world/09niger/09niger-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
DAKAR, Senegal ‚Äî Gunmen killed eight people on Sunday at a wildlife reserve in Niger, including six French humanitarian workers, their Nigerien driver and a guide, according to authorities.</p>
<p>The group had traveled to Kour√© reserve in an area known as the Giraffe Zone, home to the only remaining population of West African giraffes. But they had been there for less than an hour when they were shot, their car set aflame and their bodies left in the sand.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was horrific. We couldn‚Äôt even look at the bodies,‚Äù said Djibo Hama, a spokesman for the Association of Kour√©‚Äôs Giraffe Guides, who saw the aftermath of the attack. ‚ÄúThey had been brutally shot with bullets, but also flamethrowers had charred the car and some of the people. It was terrifying to see them lying on the ground in their own blood.‚Äù</p>
<p>Some areas of Mali have been rocked by terrorist attacks in recent years, as have several neighboring West African countries. But the Giraffe Zone has been widely considered safe. The visitors were French humanitarian workers, said the authorities.

<h3 id="niger-lost-tens-of-millions-to-arms-deals-malpractice-leaked-report-alleges">&ldquo;Niger lost tens of millions to arms deals malpractice, leaked report alleges&rdquo;</h3>

More than $100m of public money in Niger, one of the world‚Äôs poorest countries and a key regional recipient of western aid, was wasted in a series of potentially corrupt international arms deals, a leaked official document alleges.</p>
<p>A confidential government audit of defence spending found that at least $137m had been lost due to malpractice over an eight-year period ending in 2019.</p>
<p>The report by the Inspection G√©n√©rale des Arm√©es, an independent body that audits Niger‚Äôs armed forces, said much of the equipment sourced from international firms in Russia, Ukraine, China and elsewhere was overpriced, had not been delivered or had been purchased without going through a genuine competitive bidding process.</p>
<p>In some instances, it alleges, documents had been forged and false companies set up, apparently to comply with regulations.</p>
<p>According to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, an independent investigative reporting platform that obtained the 53-page audit, more than $320m worth of deals out of a total of $875m were problematic. The OCCRP shared its findings with the Guardian before publication.</p>

<p>Public prosecutors in Niger are investigating the findings, which have become part of a bitter political battle before presidential and legislative elections scheduled for later this year. Opposition politicians hope the scandal will weaken the ruling party and its likely candidate, Mohamed Bazoum, the defence minister.</p>
<p>The scandal has prompted a series of public protests and strikes in Niger despite government promises to recover the lost funds, punish any ‚Äúpublic agents‚Äù responsible and introduce wide-ranging reforms.</p>
<p>The audit was handed to Niger‚Äôs most senior prosecutor in April, who said at the time that those involved would be held accountable. The audit gives figures in euros and West African CFA francs, which were converted to dollars by the OCCRP.</p>
<p>In one deal in 2016, Niger‚Äôs ministry of defence bought two Mi-171Sh military helicopters from Rosoboronexport, Russia‚Äôs state-owned defence company. The auditors questioned the price of ‚Ç¨55m ($62m), which also included maintenance and ammunition, saying they had been unable to explain why the sum appeared to them to be inflated by $19.7m.</p>
<p>The auditors noted that the contract was negotiated by direct agreement without competition in 2016 and questioned the decision to conclude a deal with a company that is under US sanctions. They were also concerned that around ‚Ç¨17.6m had been added to the overall package to cover optional extras. This was the equivalent of acquiring an additional helicopter, they noted. A Rosoboronexport spokesperson declined to answer OCCRP‚Äôs emailed requests for comment.</p>
<p>In another deal mentioned in the audit, $4.9m was paid to outfit the presidential plane with an anti-missile system that was described by auditors as ‚Äúineffective‚Äù.</p>
<p>Despite its deep poverty, Niger has spent heavily over the last decade on arms ranging from attack helicopters and fighter jets to armoured vehicles and automatic rifles. The country‚Äôs new military capabilities and its strategically significant location in the Sahel region have made it an important ally for local and western powers fighting a tenacious Islamic extremist insurgency.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Nigerien troops have been killed in a series of massacres in the conflict. In 2017, five died alongside four US special forces soldiers in an ambush by militants linked to Islamic State. There have been repeated complaints that troops lack correct equipment and training, and receive poor rations and pay.</p>

<p>Niger has received huge sums in development and humanitarian aid from the US, as well as hundreds of millions dollars in military assistance and payments for humanitarian operations from the US during the period examined by the auditors.</p>
<p>In a briefing this week, Maj Gen Dagvin Anderson, the commander of US Special Operations Command Africa, described Niger as ‚Äúa shining example of a partner who may not have a lot of resources but has the will to take what ‚Ä¶ is provided to them by the international community and use it to great effect‚Äù.</p>
<p>A swarm of motorbikes, then heavy fire: witnesses shed new light on Niger attack Read more</p>
<p>France sees Niger as a priority country for humanitarian and development assistance, while the UK has given some minor aid too.</p>
<p>Many of the suspect deals revealed by the report involve a small number of well-connected businessmen with close ties to Niger‚Äôs government. ‚ÄúAll the economic actors mentioned in the audit belong to the ruling party. They come from the same region as the president,‚Äù said Hassane Diallo, the head of Centre d‚ÄôAssistance Juridique et d‚ÄôAction Citoyenne, a Niger-based anti-corruption group.</p>
<p>The government said the country‚Äôs armed forces had never been so well equipped.</p>
<p>According to the audit, as well as a previous investigation conducted by the ministry of finance in 2017, contracts to supply military equipment to the armed forces, including weapons and ammunition, night-vision goggles and a trailer for transporting tanks, may have cost the defence ministry $24.7m more than they should have done.</p>
<p>Investigators also examined a $40m agreement to purchase Chinese armoured personnel carriers. They believed the price had been inflated by $8.2m.</p>
<p>In 2017 a Nigerien company won a $6.5m contract to supply 30 buses to the ministry of defence. More than half of the payment was questionable, the auditors found.</p>
<p>Other contracts used shell companies in Ukraine, the UK and the Czech Republic in an apparent effort to avoid scrutiny of multimillion-dollar payments connected to deals, the auditors found.</p>
<p>Diallo said the deals ‚Äúnot only exposed a hidden financial cost to Niger ‚Äì the poorest country in the world ‚Äì but also show how Niger‚Äôs sovereignty was captured and exploited‚Äù.</p>
<p>Niger ranks last out of 189 countries on the United Nations Development Index, with an average life expectancy of 62 and an average per capita income of less than $1,000 annually.
