<p><img src="https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/americas-got-talent-winners-darci-lynne-farmer-grace-vanderwaal.jpg" alt="img">
With “America’s Got Talent” season 15 now underway, now is the perfect time to check in with the first 14 acts to win “AGT” and see where they are now. Scroll through the photo gallery above to get updates on all 14 “AGT” winners. The most recent of these, singer/songwriter Kodi Lee, was all set to tour until the COVID-19 pandemic put those plans on hold. While the same can be said for all of the past champs, we have some news about them.</p>
<p>Magician Shin Lim turned 13 into a lucky number. Just weeks after he won “America’s Got Talent” in the fall of 2018, he competed on the first season of “AGT: The Champions” and took that title too. In the suspenseful finale of that special edition of the “AGT” franchise show, Shin barely edged out season 12 “AGT” champion Darci Lynne Farmer. That pint-sized singing ventriloquist is one of the most successful of the “America’s Got Talent” winners. She was the third voice thrower to win “AGT” after Terry Fator (Season 2) and Paul Zerdin (Season 10) and tours extensively as does Shin.</p>

<p>Farmer was the third child star to win “AGT,” following in the footsteps of Season 1 winner singer Bianca Ryan (at age 11 the youngest-ever winner) and Season 11 champ Grace VanderWaal, a 12-year-old singer-songwriter/ukulele player. They are also the only three females to win “America’s Got Talent.”</p>
<p>Beginning in season 3, four male singers in a row won: Neal E. Boyd, Kevin Skinner, Michael Grimm and Landau Eugene Murphy Jr. Boyd died in 2018 of heart failure at age 42. This quartet of male singers was followed by three variety acts: the Olate Dogs (season 7), modern dancer Kenichi Ebina (season 8) and magician Mat Franco (season 9).</p>

And so then — sorry, it’s a really long story — I went to my friend Ido [Zmishlany], because we were in a producing session, and I start playing “Good Habits.” And then we start listening to the angsty indie music, and the two puzzle pieces clicked in my mind. I felt like such an idiot. I’m like, “How did I not see this before?” The angsty indie singer is the 6-year-old! She’s grown up now. And I’m so proud of her, because that music is really good, too. I love both of them.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Chanel Makeup</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t want to sound too bougie, but here’s the situation. I started kind of working with Chanel. I don’t want to imply that they’ve signed me. They have brought me out to a couple of things, which is insane. And for specific performances, they offer to dress me. They use Chanel makeup on me as well, and sometimes I get to keep it. You just feel so French.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Koreatown in Manhattan</li>
</ol>
<p>Me and my best friend — she lives in upstate New York, where I live — go to Koreatown every other weekend almost. I don’t even remember how this all started, but we always go to this same restaurant. And I have no idea of the name, to be honest. The food isn’t unbelievable, and it’s not very scenic. I think it’s just more of the tradition at this point that we like the most.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Flea Markets and Vintage Stores</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re ever in New York City, it’s Flamingos. They base [the price] off the weight of what you’re buying, and there are really, really aesthetic cool pieces that are one of a kind.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>“Breakfast at Tiffany’s”</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember how I was telling you about my “Aladdin” addiction? Well, I was addicted to “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” but it was actually worse, because I would watch it multiple times a day. That was a while ago, but it still holds a special place in my heart. It’s like I’m watching my Pinterest board, you know? I have at least a hundred different Pinterest boards for all different things: my future apartment, my future husband, my future shoes, the decorations I want to put in my future car. Audrey Hepburn in “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” is on so many of my boards.

<h3 id="often-compared-to-billie-eilish-grace-vanderwaal-trades-her-ukelele-for-stargirl">&ldquo;Often Compared to Billie Eilish, Grace VanderWaal trades her Ukelele for &lsquo;Stargirl&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://usa-grlk5lagedl.stackpathdns.com/production/usa/images/1589810702163217-grace-vanderwaal-chanel.jpg?w=1920&amp;h=800&amp;fit=clip&amp;crop=faces&amp;auto=%5B%22format%22%2C%20%22compress%22%5D&amp;cs=srgb" alt="img">
Becoming a child star can often come at the detrimental cost of losing oneself, and often the external pressure of media, and now evermore with social media, can leave permanent damage on young talent. However, for Grace VanderWaal, who was the winner of America&rsquo;s Got Talent at only 12-years-old, her early rise to fame has only helped her to build and even stronger foundation as a singer, and a soon-to-be leading actress in the upcoming film Stargirl on Disney+. Now at 16-years-old, her early-found fame has led her to tap into a level of complex songwriting far beyond her years. Compared to the likes of Taylor Swift, and most recently Billie Eilish for the lyrical depth she produces, the gifted songstress is aiming to create a path unique to her own identity.

<h3 id="grace-vanderwaals-first-onscreen-kiss-in-disneys-stargirl-was-a-big-deal">&ldquo;Grace VanderWaal&rsquo;s first onscreen kiss in Disney&rsquo;s &lsquo;Stargirl&rsquo; was a &lsquo;big deal&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/03/12/USAT/3bd2ec9a-67f4-4d6e-941c-e887ab5e33ee-grace1.jpeg?crop=3609,2031,x204,y0&amp;width=3200&amp;height=1801&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
Her ukulele is the same size, but Grace VanderWaal has grown up plenty since she first appeared on TV as a 12-year-old “America’s Got Talent” champion in 2016.</p>
<p>Now, after releasing music, touring the nation and modeling, the singer/songwriter has a new role as the titular star of the Disney movie “Stargirl” (streaming Friday on Disney+).</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll probably recognize her, even though she&rsquo;s grown nearly a foot in four years.</p>
<p>“I don&rsquo;t really know exactly how tall. I think I&rsquo;m 5-foot-8 or something like that,” says VanderWaal, 16.</p>
<p>We caught up with VanderWaal right after she performed on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” to talk about her new movie, forthcoming music and why memorizing a monologue was easier than playing her uke on the set.</p>
<p>Q: You just played your moody new single, “Today and Tomorrow,” accompanying yourself on ukulele. Sticking to your roots with your signature instrument?</p>
<p>Grace VanderWaal:I actually didn’t (write the song with the ukulele in mind). I was just singing in the studio and the producer pulled out a ukulele and started kind of like jamming to it and then we were just like, “That sounds really good.” The whole song just kind of happened. I wrote it while I was filming “Stargirl,” and I showed director Julia Hart and I guess she liked it. So it’s in the (end credits).</p>
<p>Q: In “Stargirl,” you play a teenager who was home-schooled but becomes a good-luck charm for a high school and serenades classmates with her ukulele. How is playing as Stargirl different from performing as yourself?</p>
<p>VanderWaal: It&rsquo;s so different! Just because I&rsquo;m not telling my own story. You know what I mean? (At my shows), I know exactly what I want people to feel. But when you&rsquo;re telling someone else&rsquo;s story, it&rsquo;s more difficult to try to figure out what they would have wanted people to feel.</p>
<p>Q: At least you had plenty of experience playing music before you did it as Stargirl. But what was it like to memorize and perform a monologue? There’s a big speech for your character in the movie.</p>
<p>VanderWaal: That was the easiest part. I feel like I&rsquo;m such a serious person. And I was just saying probably the truest emotions of my personal feelings in the movie (when my character makes a speech about appreciating the beauty of a flower growing). It read easily for me, and I feel like you can see that in the movie.</p>
<p>Q: Last year, you made it sound as though “Stargirl” was a one-off for you. Have you changed your mind about pursuing acting?</p>
<p>VanderWaal: Yes! I learned so much while making this movie, and I&rsquo;m ready to apply it and see if I can be good. You can&rsquo;t really do anything to the best of your ability on the first try or even the second try, but I do want to see. I like to be good at things. If I&rsquo;m doing something, I want to abandon it knowing I did the best I could. There’s this one role that I really, really want, but I don’t want to talk about it because there’s literally like a 30% chance that I’ll actually get it.</p>
<p>Q: You’ve acted in your own music videos before this movie, but you have your first onscreen kiss in “Stargirl.”</p>
<p>VanderWaal: That was a big deal. There were closed sets for every scene like that.</p>
<p>I mean, I was 14, very, very young. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m a grown-up and I&rsquo;ve had like tons of boyfriends, you know? So of course I was nervous, but we all made sure we were just being our characters and (co-star Graham Verchere, who plays Leo) was professional. I think the nerves actually worked well for the movie because Stargirl is supposed to be like that, she’s not some player.</p>
<p>Q: Stargirl has plenty of glittery and playful fashion, while your style has gotten pretty sophisticated through your modeling and recent trip to Paris Fashion Week. Were there any Stargirl items that Grace VanderWaal would really wear?</p>
<p>VanderWaal: There is one outfit that Grace VanderWaal would actually wear in real life, and it was during a dating montage where she was practicing her speech in front of Leo: the pom-pom vest. It didn’t get that much screen time, but I felt so comfortable and confident in that outfit and I would absolutely wear that.</p>
<p>Q: Are you planning any live shows this year after “Kimmel”?</p>
<p>VanderWaal: (Coronavirus) is actually really impacting my schedule. We&rsquo;re afraid that two upcoming festivals I was like looking forward to for months (including BottleRock Napa Valley in May) are probably going to get canceled. It&rsquo;s really messing up a lot of things for a lot of people. But I understand. I mean it&rsquo;s pretty crazy.</p>
<p>Q: You’ve put out a steady stream of singles since your 2017 debut album “Just the Beginning.” Is songwriting still a priority for you?</p>
<p>VanderWaal: Yeah. I’m preparing for Volume 2 of my EP, and I like the music that I’m making, so let’s see how it all turns out. It’s really good, but I wouldn’t say I’m entering a new direction. I’m not rapping or doing new genres.</p>
<p>Q: So we will hear more ukulele?</p>
<p>VanderWaal: Possibly.

<h3 id="compiled-just-for-you-the-emmy-eligible-original-songs-playlist-for-2020">&ldquo;Compiled just for you: The Emmy-eligible original songs playlist for 2020&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9e30337/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2100x1103+0+199/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6f%2F4c%2F33cab4564eb5aa0885aa0e0e9501%2Femmy-contending-original-songs-2020.jpg" alt="img">
The streaming explosion has wildly ramped up competition in all kinds of Emmy categories, with many more contenders and many boundaries broken. The original songs race is certainly no exception, since traditional contenders often find themselves competing these days against pop stars and viral hits.</p>
<p>Streamers such as Apple TV+, Netflix and Disney+ bring new muscle to the fight. But will multiple winners “Saturday Night Live” and the Tonys continue to rule with their brand of novelty tunes? Here are some of the best original songs eligible for Emmys this year.</p>
<p>For the record: An earlier version of this post included the song “Only You” from ABC’s “A Million Little Things.” That song is not original to the show and has been removed from the story and playlist.</p>
<p>As a bonus, these flow together nicely as a playlist (hence the numbering here, which is for the sequence of play, not as an indicator of quality). The whole thing is also available as a YouTube playlist with a bonus track.</p>
<p>× The official lyric video for “Toss a Coin to Your Witcher,” from Netflix’s “The Witcher.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<ol>
<li>‘Toss a Coin to Your Witcher’ (‘The Witcher’)</li>
</ol>
<p>Warning: Sonya Belousova and Giona Ostinelli’s song (with lyrics by Jenny Klein and performed by Joey Batey) is accursedly catchy, likely due to some dark magic in the chorus. So beware of the ear worm, O Valley of Plenty. Now, maybe they didn’t have hair metal back in ye olde sword-and-sorcery days (whenever those were), but although the version in the show doesn’t rock your face off, there are a number of viral covers that do (the song has been remixed and covered by many, many fans), and it’s just so right for that treatment. If you check Dan Vasc’s stab at it on YouTube (more than 12 million views), grab the arms of your chair around the 2:33 mark and ROCK ON.</p>
<p>× Song “One Less Angel” from Amazon’s “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” Season 3.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>‘One Less Angel’ (‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’)</li>
</ol>
<p>Simply nails the show’s turn-of-the-&rsquo;60s period. The vocal by Darius De Haas (the singing voice of crooner Shy Baldwin, played by Leroy McClain) is particularly strong.</p>
<p>× Song “Kiss Me in the Morning” from Netflix’s “The Eddy,” performed by the cast during quarantine and released for International Jazz Day (April 30, 2020).</p>

<p>A legit upbeat jazz tune from the heavily music-themed Netflix show. This version was recorded in quarantine and released to commemorate International Jazz Day 2020 (April 30). The soundtrack also contains a version with a soulful vocal by Jorja Smith.</p>
<p>× Song “That’s Enough” from the Disney+ “Lady and the Tramp,” performed by Janelle Monáe.</p>

<p>Janelle Monáe plugs back into some of her “Electric Lady&rdquo;-era pop-jazz vocal skills.</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>‘I Am America’ (‘We’re Here’)</li>
</ol>
<p>An R&amp;B rave-up anthem you can (must?) dance to, powered by an excellent vocal from Shea Diamond. This is the unscripted series’ theme song, but it remains eligible in this category because there’s no main title sequence. Besides, this playlist needed a shot of attitude.</p>
<p>× In an appearance on the animated “American Dad,” The Weeknd reveals his deep, dark secret &hellip; in song.</p>

</ol>
<p>Then come the novelty songs, which frequently win in this category (“D— in a Box” is how Justin Timberlake got his first Emmy, and seven winners in the last decade could be considered such). This one is not only performed by Grammy-winning, platinum-selling superstar the Weeknd (Abel Tesfaye), but absolutely inhabits his sonic persona.</p>
<p>× The wistful folk song “Five Long Years (Waiting for You),” performed by Peter, Paula &amp; Murray (David Harbour, Kate McKinnon and Aidy Bryant, but not necessarily respectively) on “Saturday Night Live.”</p>

<ol start="7">
<li>‘Five Long Years (Waiting for You)’ (‘Saturday Night Live’)</li>
</ol>
<p>Speaking of novelty songs, “Saturday Night Live,” with 10 nominations and two wins since 2010, has its usual slew of qualifiers this year. Among its best is this early-&rsquo;60s-style folk ballad by a Peter, Paul and Mary-ish trio (played by host David Harbour, Kate McKinnon and Aidy Bryant). In it, they mark their lives by the calendar, “Seasons of Love” style. But perhaps not as pithily.</p>
<p>Other contenders from the show include “Salad,” featuring Bryant with a suitably jarring appearance by Daniel Craig, and the Halloween-themed “Spooky Song,” featuring Chance the Rapper in a shocking recitation of how ghosts in a graveyard met their fates.</p>
<p>× Music video of Olivia Rodrigo performing “All I Want” from Disney +'s “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.”</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>‘All I Want’ (‘High School Musical: The Musical — The Series’)</li>

<p>Written and performed by star Olivia Rodrigo, it’s a memorable power ballad that was certified gold as a single.</p>

<p>× Lyric video for “Weirdos” from Apple TV+'s “Central Park.”</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>‘Weirdos Make Great Superheroes’ (‘Central Park’)</li>
</ol>
<p>The new musical animated series on Apple TV+ has an embarrassment of riches in the talent department. This song is written by Sara Bareilles and sung by Kristen Bell and Tituss Burgess.</p>
<p>× Jennifer Nettles and Walton Goggins perform “Misbehavin’ ” from HBO’s “The Righteous Gemstones.”</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>‘Misbehavin’’ (‘The Righteous Gemstones’)</li>
</ol>
<p>Perfect for that show’s environs and would have been right at home on a “Grand Ole Opry” broadcast. Series costar Jennifer Nettles is a Grammy- and ACM-nominated singer-songwriter, but fans of “Justified” may be surprised to find that Boyd Crowder (Walton Goggins, playing Baby Billy on “Gemstones”) can kick up his heels when he wants to.</p>

<p>× The song “Anything Goes in Florida” from Netflix’s “Big Mouth.”</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>‘Anything Goes in Florida’ (‘Big Mouth’)</li>
</ol>
<p>A hair-metal tribute to some of the Sunshine State’s special qualities. One of the cleanest excerpts from this NSFW rocker: “Come on down and do your worst / Snort a rail off a dolphin / Naked and a-golfin’ / Chances are you won’t be the first.”</p>
<p>× The song “Afterlife” from Apple TV+'s “Dickinson,” performed and co-written by series star Hailee Steinfeld.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>‘Afterlife’ (‘Dickinson’)</li>
</ol>
<p>Performed and co-written by series star Hailee Steinfeld, it would be an unusually forward-reaching choice by Television Academy voters. The lyrics effectively express the protagonist’s morbid/romantic obsessions (“Will death be our last kiss, my love? Oh-oh / When my heartbeat stops, will you stay mine?”). But the music — totally appropriate for the often-anachronistic show — is meticulous electro-pop with layered production &hellip; not the kind of thing that usually gets a nomination, regardless of quality. The same qualification applies, by the way, to Labrinth and Zendaya’s song from “Euphoria,” “All for Us.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>× The song “Wondering,” from “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” on Disney+.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>‘Wondering’ (High School Musical: The Musical — The Series)</li>
</ol>
<p>A wistful ballad perhaps overshadowed by the better-known “All I Want,” but definitely worthy of consideration. Rodrigo and Julia Lester look like formidable young talents. There’s also a lovely acoustic version that showcases the impressive pipes of more of the cast.</p>
<p>× Grace VanderWaal’s song “Today and Tomorrow” from the Disney+ movie, “Stargirl.”</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>‘Today and Tomorrow’ (‘Stargirl’)</li>
</ol>
<p>Speaking of wistful, there’s this unadorned ukulele ditty by the Disney+ movie’s star and real life rising singer-songwriter Grace VanderWaal (co-written by Ido Zmishlany).</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>‘The Eddy’ (‘The Eddy’)</li>
</ol>
<p>A haunting jazz rhapsody written by Randy Kerber and longtime pop producer Glen Ballard and performed by the show’s band, featuring lead actress/vocalist Joanna Kulig (of “Cold War”). Note: This is not the show’s theme, so it is eligible in this category.</p>
<p>× The opening number of the 73rd Tony Awards, performed by James Corden and many others: “We Do It Live.”</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>‘We Do It Live’ (‘The 73rd Annual Tony Awards’)</li>
</ol>
<p>Big, brassy, long (about 10 minutes) and featuring cameos from tons of nominated casts, it’s just the kind of glammy, showy number that gets voters’ attention. Three songs from Tonys broadcasts have won since 2012.</p>

<p>× “Next Year,” from the socially distanced, COVID-19 benefit online show, “Saturday Night Seder.” Lead vocals by Shaina Taub and Skylar Astin.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>‘Next Year’ (‘Saturday Night Seder’)</li>
</ol>
<p>And then, out of nowhere, an online, Passover-themed COVID-19 benefit boasting major-league talent (Jason Alexander, Darren Criss, Rachel Brosnahan, Idina Menzel, for starters) pops up with a beautiful gut-punch closer. The song plays off the Seder-ending, hopeful idea of “Next year in Jerusalem” to tie touchingly into the pandemic. It features award-winning singer-songwriter Shaina Taub (who co-wrote) and reminds us that that Skylar Astin dude (of “Spring Awakening”) can really sing. By the way, the song is co-written by Benj Pasek (“Dear Evan Hansen”); should it win, he would become an EGOT honoree at just 35.</p>

<h3 id="hear-grace-vanderwaals-today-and-tomorrow-ahead-of-stargirl-release">&ldquo;Hear Grace VanderWaal’s ‘Today and Tomorrow’ Ahead of ‘Stargirl’ Release&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GraceVanderwall.jpg" alt="img">
Ahead of her appearance in Disney+ feature film Stargirl, Grace VanderWaal has released new song “Today and Tomorrow.” Stargirl will premiere on the streaming platform on March 13th.</p>
<p>On “Today and Tomorrow,” VanderWaal tenderly sings of unconditional love over the gentle strum of her ukulele. She details the feeling of falling in love with someone, including all the hope and fears that come along with it. “One day I’ll be old and ugly/Will you still be thinking of me?/If we were as brave as we are now/They’ll catch you thinking of me,” she sings toward the end of the sweet, simple tune.</p>
<p>Stargirl is the 16-year-old’s acting debut, with VanderWaal playing the titular Stargirl. It is based on the 2000 book of the same name, written by Jerry Spinelli, which tells the tale of a unique, quirky teen girl who starts at a new high school only to be shunned by the majority of her peers except for a boy named Leo (Graham Verchere).</p>
<p>After winning America’s Got Talent in 2016, VanderWaal has gone on to release one full-length album (2017’s Just the Beginning) and several singles, including last year’s “Ur So Beautiful.”
