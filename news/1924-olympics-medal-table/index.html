<p>Fact of the day</p>
<p>At the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Iranian judoka Arash Miresmaeili was disqualified for weighing in at nearly four pounds above the limit for his weight class of his under-66 kilograms match against an Israeli opponent Ehud Vaks in the first round. It was claimed Miresmaeili had gone on an eating binge to protest the International Olympic Committee&rsquo;s recognition of the state of Israel. Iran does not recognise the state of Israel, and Miresmaeili&rsquo;s actions won praise from high-ranking Iranian officials. Mohammad Khatami, the country&rsquo;s President at the time, was quoted as saying Miresmaili&rsquo;s actions would be &ldquo;recorded in the history of Iranian glories&rdquo;. He was later awarded $125,000 by the Government - the same amount given to Olympic gold medallists.

<h3 id="russia-clinch-mens-ice-hockey-title-at-lausanne-2020">&ldquo;Russia clinch men&rsquo;s ice hockey title at Lausanne 2020&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.insidethegames.biz/media/image/167960/o/veNYs7s9BcdBUMET" alt="img">
Russia sent a warning of the strength-in-depth in their junior ranks, easing to victory over the United States to secure the men&rsquo;s ice hockey gold medal at Lausanne 2020.</p>
<p>The Russian team beat the defending champions 4-0 in a one-sided final at Vaudoise Arena.</p>
<p>Matvei Michkov scored twice, while Ruslan Gazizov and Vyacheslav Malov also got in on the act in a commanding Russian display.</p>
<p>Victory saw Russia leapfrog Switzerland into top spot on the Lausanne 2020 medals table.</p>
<p>Russia ended the third Winter Youth Olympic Games with 10 golds, 11 silver and eight bronze.</p>
<p>The host nation also won 10 golds, but finished the Games on six silver and eight bronze.</p>
<p>Matvei Michkov scored twice to end as the tournament&rsquo;s top scorer ©Getty Images</p>
<p>&ldquo;Physically we were a bit stronger, so when we could we applied some pressure on them,&rdquo; said Michkov, the tournament&rsquo;s top scorer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Discipline plays a really important role.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won today because of discipline and team spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The result may have gone some way to easing the cloud over Russian sport, as the country awaits a final decision on whether its flag will be banned from major events, including the Olympic Games, as punishment for the state-sponsored doping scandal.</p>
<p>It was rarely in doubt as the Russian team dominated at both ends of the rink.</p>
<p>Michkov&rsquo;s first-period double set the tone, before Gazizov made it 3-0 after the restart.</p>
<p>Malov put the gloss on a convincing performance by scoring a fourth in the final period, and the result was greeted with wild celebrations by the Russian team and coaching staff.</p>
<p>Canada claimed bronze with a 4-2 win in the third-place playoff against Finland.

<h3 id="baff-wins-australias-first-winter-yog-gold-medal-by-a-whisker">&ldquo;Baff wins Australia’s first Winter YOG gold medal by a whisker&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://stillmed.olympic.org/media/Images/OlympicOrg/News/2020/01/20/SNOWBOARD%20CROSS/2020-01-20-snowboard-cross-thumbnail.jpg" alt="img">
Australia’s first Winter Youth Olympic Games gold medal arrived in the most dramatic of circumstances on Monday at Villars Winter Park as Josie Baff (AUS) won the women’s snowboard cross final by just 0.05 seconds.</p>
<p>Baff pipped Margaux Herpin (FRA) to grab what was also Australia’s first medal of the Lausanne 2020 Winter Youth Olympic Games. Anouk Doerig (SUI) got the bronze.</p>
<p>“I’m stoked, I’m shocked, I’m very overwhelmed,” Baff said. “The conditions were perfect. Everyone was racing so well. Every single race has been insanely close. Something hit me at the end to win it. I don’t remember much about the race. My mum and dad are in tears and so was I. Everyone will be so happy back home.”</p>
<p>OIS/IOC</p>
<p>In the men’s event it was business as usual for Switzerland, who have won gold medals on all but one of the competition days at Villars. Valerio Jud (SUI) prevailed in another close contest.</p>
<p>OIS/IOC</p>
<p>“I feel really happy,” he said. “The race was a little bit sketchy but the end was good. Having the support from the crowd was very nice.”</p>
<p>OIS/IOC</p>
<p>Niels Conradt (GER) got silver and Alvaro Romero (ESP) bronze.</p>
<p>While the winners are highly experienced boarders, a fascinating exception from further down the field were the Chinese women.</p>
<p>Neither Chai Xin (CHN) nor Nimayongqing (CHN) had been on a snowboard until June 2018. Now, they are full-time athletes determined to perform at a high level at the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games.</p>
<p>China would like to attract more athletes to elite snowboard competition and are investing in the sport.</p>
<p>OIS/IOC</p>
<p>“They put a lot of resources into it,” said Li Zhongyi (CHN), head of the Chinese snowboard team. “They set about identifying some girls who were good athletes. Chai was excellent at kung fu. She had never been on the snow.</p>
<p>“They are making very fast progress. They might not have years of boarding like the European athletes but they are putting in lots of hours every day.”

<h3 id="philip-barker-the-forbidden-olympic-table">&ldquo;Philip Barker: The forbidden Olympic table&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.insidethegames.biz/media/image/160352/o/Philip+Barker.png" alt="img">
Talk of &ldquo;medal tables&rdquo; has been mercifully rare at the Lausanne 2020 Winter Youth Olympic Games, which came to an end this week. But be under no illusion, everyone will be talking about it at Tokyo 2020.</p>
<p>Statistical agency Gracenote has already predicted that the United States will win 119 medals. This will put them top of a table which is expressly forbidden by the International Olympic Committee.</p>
<p>Rule 57 of the Olympic Charter includes the instruction that: &ldquo;The IOC and the Olympic organising committee shall not draw up a global ranking for any country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the Olympic oath requires an acceptance of the rules by everyone, this one Olympic regulation is disregarded on a regular basis by almost every National Olympic Committee and no one raises an eyebrow.</p>
<p>Gunilla Lindberg, general secretary of the Association of National Olympic Committees, has admitted: &ldquo;It is very difficult to avoid because people are interested in how their countries are doing and comparing with other countries. It is a rule, but it always happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a century-old problem. Before the First World War, United States Olympic official James Sullivan made a prediction for the 1916 Olympics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Berlin, I am confident we will win as usual!&rdquo; he said, after the 1914 IOC congress in Paris and elaborate scoring systems were devised to work out who &ldquo;won&rdquo; the Olympics.</p>
<p>Baron Pierre de Coubertin, pictured here in momument form outside the New National Stadium in Tokyo, wasn&rsquo;t keen on medal tables ©Getty Images</p>
<p>Baron Pierre de Coubertin, IOC President in the formative years, would not have been amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The true Olympic hero is, in my view, the individual adult male.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this day, &ldquo;Rule 6 of the Charter states The Olympic Games are competitions between athletes in individual or team events and not between countries. They bring together the athletes selected by their respective NOCs, whose entries have been accepted by the IOC.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the Second World War, the respective NOCs included the Soviet Union, who took part for the first time in 1952.</p>
<p>From then on, East and West drew up medal tables.</p>
<p>IOC President Avery Brundage was so concerned, he sent a letter to each NOC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The International Olympic Committee resents attempts to use the Games as a political instrument, or to pit one country against another,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;We trust that you will do everything in your power to discourage the publication of scoring tables, which are quite worthless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wishes to repeat it once more as follows: Scoring of Points. The Olympic Games are a contest between individuals. They are designed to be a joyous festival of the youth of the world. The competitors give their best efforts - win if they can - but, if not, rejoice with the victors. The Games are not, and must not become, a contest between nations, which would be entirely contrary to the spirit of the Olympic Movement and would surely lead to disaster. For this reason there is no official score of nations and tables of points are really misinformation because they are entirely inaccurate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He conceded: &ldquo;Normal national pride is perfectly legitimate, but neither the Olympic Games, nor any other sport contest, can be said to indicate the superiority of one political system over another, or of one country over another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the 1956 IOC Session in Cortina D’Ampezzo, Brundage raised the matter again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doubts if the newspapers will give up publishing such classifying methods, but it is right that the general public should be informed that scoring by countries means nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, a few weeks later, the New York Times reported that Soviet officials &ldquo;boasted Russian top ranking in the Winter Olympics was what we came for&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be way out in front at the Summer Olympics in Melbourne,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>The IOC were further angered when the East German National Olympic Committee exhorted its athletes &ldquo;not to forget the political question&rdquo; whilst winning medals.</p>
<p>It prompted the British middle distance runner Chris Chataway to write: &ldquo;The Olympic Games is no longer the field for gentlemen. It would be worth getting back all the same to the idea of an Olympic Games as a competition between individuals rather than a prestige battle amongst nations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IOC President Brundage was amongst those who advocated ceremonies with a fanfare of trumpets rather than national anthems, but nothing came of it.</p>
<p>The medal competition became more fierce at the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne ©Getty Images</p>
<p>Almost a decade later, the IOC met for their session in Mexico City ahead of the 1968 Olympics.</p>
<p>And there were those prepared to try again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince George of Hanover then proceeded with his personal proposal to abolish the use of national anthems and flags during the victory ceremony of the Olympic Games.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stressed especially that the Olympic honours should be directed more to the athletes in their personal quality, than as a representative of their country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A total of 34 members voted for the change and only 22 against, but it was never adopted because a motion needed a two thirds majority to pass.</p>
<p>Brundage had also raised the matter with NOCs and reported &ldquo;in general they were against the idea&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Many nations did compete under the Olympic flag at Moscow 1980, but this was in itself to make a political protest.</p>
<p>Sir Denis Follows, chairman of the British Olympic Association, admitted this was &ldquo;a gesture to show our opposition to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He also said that the decision was &ldquo;to remove the nationalistic element which has become far too prominent in the Olympic Games&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Despite this, the medal tables remained every bit as prominent in Moscow.</p>
<p>Unlike a league table in team sports, where points are awarded for a similar contest, the Olympic medal table does not compare like with like. Brundage himself drew attention to this anomaly in the 1950s.</p>
<p>The people of Fiji came out in their masses to celebrate rugby sevens gold in Rio ©Getty Images</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be correct they would have to be weighted, since it is certainly unfair to give the winner of the marathon or decathlon, a winning gymnast, pistol shooter or yachtsman, and a winning football or basketball team the same score. Moreover, to be fair the factor of population should be considered, and if careful analysis were made, it would be discovered that many small nations have won far more Olympic medals on a per-capita basis than the larger countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1976, Sports Review magazine also insisted that &ldquo;the traditional medal table featured in the sporting press throughout the Olympic fortnight is quite meaningless as it fails to take account of a country&rsquo;s population size&rdquo;.</p>
<p>They suggested one showing &ldquo;relative excellence&rdquo; gold medals per million population.</p>
<p>Relative strength showed the total medals per million population.</p>
<p>At the 2016 Rio Olympics, the United States won 46 golds, more than any other nation. Five of those went to Michael Phelps in his Olympic swansong.</p>
<p>Yet in a table based on population size drawn up by olympicmedalspercapita.com, the USA finished only 31st. The Bahamas were top, with one gold medal from a population of just 388,000.</p>
<p>Many of Fiji&rsquo;s 892,000 citizens stopped to celebrate their first gold medal - success in sevens rugby in Rio. By all accounts, news of their victory stopped traffic in Suva and the players became national heroes. The memory of defeating New Zealand and Great Britain will live forever. Few will remember where Fiji finished in the &ldquo;medal table&rdquo;.

China win four golds to top medal table at Asia-Oceania Olympic boxing qualifier</p>
<p>China won four golds to top the medal table on the final day of the Asia-Oceania Olympic boxing qualifier for Tokyo 2020 in Amman.</p>
<p>Finals were held in every weight class today to conclude the event here at Prince Hamzah Hall in Jordan&rsquo;s capital.</p>
<p>All of the finalists had already achieved their main objective of qualifying for Tokyo 2020, with each division offering at least four spots at the Games.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s Jianguan Hu claimed the most dramatic victory for his country as he stopped Thailand&rsquo;s 19-year-old Thitisan Panmot in the first round of the flyweight final.</p>
<p>The Thai was struck on the neck and had to be stretchered out of the arena.</p>
<p>He later failed to attend the medal ceremony with a team official standing on the podium in his place.</p>
<p>Panmot defeated reigning Olympic and world champion Shakhobidin Zoirov of Uzbekistan yesterday to book his place in the gold medal bout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first time that I&rsquo;ve knocked out an opponent and right now I&rsquo;m very worried for him and I hope he is alright,&rdquo; said Hu, the Rio 2016 bronze medallist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came here to achieve a target and I&rsquo;m very happy to leave as the winner of this tournament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s other three golds came in female events.</p>
<p>In the women&rsquo;s flyweight final, Yuan Chan got a split decision verdict against fourth seed Tsukimi Namiki after the Japanese fighter was deducted a point.</p>
<p>There was also Chinese success in the women&rsquo;s welterweight as third seed Gu Hong defeated top seed Nien-Chin Chen of Chinese Taipei, who won the world title in 2018.</p>
<p>Li Qian completed the Chinese treble in women&rsquo;s classes, as the top seed beat Australia&rsquo;s second seed Caitlin Parker at middleweight.</p>
<p>Uzbekistan, who topped the medal table at the Rio 2016 Olympics and last year&rsquo;s Men&rsquo;s World Championships, ended with three titles.</p>
<p>Their haul included gold in the men&rsquo;s featherweight for top seed and world champion Mirazizbek Mirzakhalilov, who proved too strong for Jordan&rsquo;s home hope Mohammad Alwadi.</p>
<p>Elnur Abduraimov then got the better of fourth seed Zakir Safiullin at lightweight in a battle between rivals Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>Tajikistan&rsquo;s top seed Bakhodur Usmonov won his box-off to reach Tokyo 2020 ©JOC</p>
<p>At super heavyweight, Uzbekistan&rsquo;s reigning world champion Bakhodir Jalolov, the top seed, saw off Australia&rsquo;s third seed Justis Huni.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan&rsquo;s reigning world champion and top seed Bekzad Nurdauletov won the light heavyweight gold against Australia&rsquo;s Paulo Aokuso, and his team-mate Vassiliy Levit won the heavyweight crown on split decision over New Zealand&rsquo;s David Nyika.</p>

Sports Minister says boxing will be key as India aims to crack Olympics top 10</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju believes boxing will be a key sport as the country aims to break into the top 10 of the Summer Olympics medal table by Los Angeles 2028.</p>
<p>The politician made the claim in a video conference held with top Indian fighters and officials.</p>
<p>At the Asia-Oceania qualifier for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic boxing tournament, held in Amman in Jordan in March, Indians performed strongly with nine athletes qualifying for the Games.</p>
<p>Tokyo 2020 has now been pushed back to 2021 due to the COVID-19 outbreak, which gives the country&rsquo;s delegation more time to prepare.</p>
<p>More Indians could still appear at the Olympics as a final world qualification tournament is scheduled to take place.</p>
<p>This was due for Paris between May 13 and 24 but was called off due to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Riiju told the almost 140 fighters, coaches and officials who signed-in for the video conference that allowing boxers to return to action as soon as possible was a key priority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have discussions with my officers,&rdquo; he said, according to The Statesman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are planning out a way to start functioning as soon as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought first of all we should allow practice for the players who have qualified for the Olympics and who will be participating in the qualifiers or important championships.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t open all the coaching centres, so we will allow only for elite athletes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Junior camps have to wait for some time as safety will be priority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Riiju has previously claimed that a &ldquo;quantum jump&rdquo; will take India into the medals table top 10 in time for Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The country won two silver medals in the first Olympics in which it competed at Paris in 1900, but has since bettered that total just twice.</p>
<p>At Beijing 2008, India won a gold thanks to Abhinav Bindra in the men&rsquo;s 10 metre air rifle event and two bronzes, and at London 2012 the nation had their best Olympic return by winning two silvers and four bronzes.</p>
<p>At the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, India won a silver and a bronze.</p>
<p>Six-time world champion Mary Kom is one of the Indian boxers who booked a Tokyo 2020 place in Amman.</p>
<p>However, the Boxing Federation of India (BFI) has been embroiled in a dispute with the International Boxing Association (AIBA) after the 2021 Men&rsquo;s World Championships were moved from New Delhi to Belgrade last month.</p>
<p>AIBA said India had not paid hosting fees but the BFI argued that the decision had been taken in &ldquo;haste&rdquo; and without consultation.

Fact of the day</p>
<p>At the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Iranian judoka Arash Miresmaeili was disqualified for weighing in at nearly four pounds above the limit for his weight class of his under-66 kilograms match against an Israeli opponent Ehud Vaks in the first round. It was claimed Miresmaeili had gone on an eating binge to protest the International Olympic Committee&rsquo;s recognition of the state of Israel. Iran does not recognise the state of Israel, and Miresmaeili&rsquo;s actions won praise from high-ranking Iranian officials. Mohammad Khatami, the country&rsquo;s President at the time, was quoted as saying Miresmaili&rsquo;s actions would be &ldquo;recorded in the history of Iranian glories&rdquo;. He was later awarded $125,000 by the Government - the same amount given to Olympic gold medallists.
