<p>Song Title: Abule</p>
<p>Artist: Patoranking</p>
<p>Genre: Afrobeat</p>
<p>Producer: Pheelz</p>
<p>Album: Three</p>
<p>Video Director: TBA</p>
<p>Label: AMARI/EMPIRE</p>
<p>Details/Takeaway: The single is a celebration of his Lagos neighborhood, Ebute Metta, and of hoods worldwide — premiered today on Beats1 with Ebro , and is out now on all DSPs.</p>
<p>The release of &lsquo;Abule&rsquo; will be supported by several digital initiatives, and a music video dropping Aug. 5, all with the theme of representing and protecting your hood.</p>
<p>“I’m proud to be from my abule, because to have made it coming from there it’s only by God’s grace,” PATORANKING says. ”It’s made me who I am today and it’s part of my story. So I waste no opportunity to let people know about my ghetto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel it’s important through this new song to give my fans a chance to celebrate their own abules. And to protect their abules, too. Back in May, my team and I partnered with Ebele &amp; Anyichuks Foundation to go to many ghettos across Lagos to give away masks and relief items. It’s important we stay safe and do our part to protect.”</p>

<h3 id="patoranking-rewards-10-students-with-full-scholarship-at-alu">&ldquo;Patoranking Rewards 10 Students With Full Scholarship At ALU&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PATORANKING-OK-NEW.jpg" alt="img">
Ten young people across Africa have emerged winners of Patoranking’s scholarship opportunity. This follows an announcement from the dancehall, reggae artiste late last year of his partnership with the African Leadership University (ALU).</p>
<p>Out of hundreds of applications received, the lucky students are Chidera Nnadozie, Emmanuel Markwei, Hardness Range, Hanisani Nleya, Amos Kusamba, Emmanuel Okorwoit, Sandra Mugeniwayesu, Abdulmaleek Usman, Kafumba Daramay and Youssouf Ouedraogo. These students are drawn from different African countries including Nigeria, Ghana, Liberia, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Kenya, and will be studying at the Rwanda and Mauritus campuses of the university.</p>
<p>The selected young scholars will be rewarded with a 100 per cent paid tuition and a once in a lifetime opportunity to be part of the next generation of extraordinary African leaders and entrepreneurs at ALU.</p>
<p>“These young Africans have distinguished themselves through their vision, resilience, and the impact they have already made in their communities despite their financial limitations. They have demonstrated exceptional potential in becoming part of the next generation of leaders that will greatly improve the continent, and it’s the potential impact that I see them making that gets me excited.”</p>
<p>Growing up in Ebutte-Metta and not being able to acquire the kind of education he desired due to financial constraints, Patoranking pledged that he will ensure less privileged kids who are resilient, driven, innovative, creative, mission-driven and have demonstrated a positive impact in their communities from a lower-income background get access to quality education.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that opportunity came up at Youth Connekt Africa in 2019, where he met the founder of ALU, Fred Swaniker and a few months later, the ALU Patoranking Scholarship was set up. The 10 students who qualified will resume in September 2020.</p>
<p>“I loved everything ALU represents and strives for, I also attended their Africa Leaders Network in Ghana and it was a fantastic experience, we both believe in the importance of ensuring Africa’s next generation of leaders are educated.</p>
<p>“I believe that exceptional leaders and change-makers can come from anywhere. Financial constraints should not prevent the next great African innovators from gaining the tools, skill sets and networks to bring their ideas to life,” Patoranking asserted.</p>
<p>He added, “I will be following up personally with each Patoranking Scholar throughout the duration of their study at ALU, and will support their development into entrepreneurial leaders”.</p>
<p>However, director of Admissions at ALU, Tino Elgner said they are excited to receive the 10 Patoranking Scholars to both its Rwanda and Mauritius Campuses for the 2020 session.</p>
<p>“The scholarship was highly contested and these young Africans were able to stand out clearly with an impressive story. We are even more confident that they will go on to create positive change starting from their communities.”</p>
<p>Patoranking has made major waves over the last few years with his unique blend of Dancehall, Reggae, and Afrobeats. Since his emergence, the music star has accumulated over 200 million views on Youtube, with his most recent album Wilmar debuted at number 5 on the global Billboard Reggae charts. He was also recently announced as a recipient of the Forbes Africa 30 under 30 class of 2020.</p>

<p>Patoranking made the announcement today via a post on Instagram which read:</p>

<p>This album is dear to the A-list superstar as it holds various meanings and represents energy of kindness, joy, imagination, creativity and growth – all of which are visibly reflected in his personal life and career.</p>
<p>The theme of this body of work is love, life and happiness. “THREE” drops on the 28th of August, 2020 – exactly a year and three months after his second album, “Wilmer.”
