<p>Juventus shocked the footballing world on Saturday evening by appointing Andrea Pirlo as their new manager.</p>
<p>Maurizio Sarri was sacked by the club just hours earlier following the Bianconeri&rsquo;s elimination from the Champions League at the hands of Lyon.</p>
<p>The hiring of Pirlo represents a massive risk for the Serie A champions, mainly due to the fact that the Italian has no experience as a manager.</p>
<p>Pirlo only took over Juve&rsquo;s U23 side last week, but has now been given one of the toughest jobs in world football.</p>
<p>The 41-year-old&rsquo;s success as a player - which included four Serie A titles with Juve - will count for absolutely nothing in the managerial arena.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something Pirlo&rsquo;s former AC Milan teammate and current Napoli manager Gennaro Gattuso was keen to stress when speaking to the Italian media on Saturday night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well he&rsquo;s screwed now. That&rsquo;s the job,&rdquo; Gattuso told Sky Italia after Napoli&rsquo;s 3-1 defeat to Barcelona at the Camp Nou, per Goal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lucky to be starting at Juventus, but this profession is one where a great playing career is not enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to study, to work hard, and you don&rsquo;t get much sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gattuso knows a thing or two about being unexpectedly handed one of the biggest jobs in world football.</p>
<p>In May 2017, he was appointed as manager of AC Milan&rsquo;s youth team before being promoted to the top job following the sacking of Vincenzo Montella later on in the year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being a player and being a coach is really not the same thing at all,&rdquo; Gattuso added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a totally different profession and we can&rsquo;t learn it just from books, we need to get in there and work hard. It&rsquo;s a different world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been warned, Andrea.</p>
<p>Pirlo&rsquo;s knowledge of the Bianconeri will, of course, serve him well as a manager, but it&rsquo;s still hard to look past his lack of experience.</p>
<p>One thing is for certain, games between Juventus and Napoli will have an added edge to them next season with Pirlo and Gattuso on the touchline.</p>

Pirlo is one of the most profound connoisseurs of football in the world – AIC president</p>
<p>The former Italy international has taken charge in Turin days after his appointment as under-23 boss following Maurizio Sarri&rsquo;s dismissal</p>
<p>Andrea Pirlo&rsquo;s appointment as the head coach of is a surprise, says Renzo Ulivieri - but the Italian Football Managers&rsquo; Association chairman believes that the former midfielder could thrive in his new job, hailing him as a &ldquo;profound connoisseur&rdquo; of football.</p>
<p>The former Italy international was handed the top job in Turin just nine days after he was handed the reins of the club&rsquo;s under-23 setup, replacing Maurizo Sarri in the wake of the Bianconeri&rsquo;s exit against on Friday.</p>
<p>The eye-catching decision to promote the 41-year-old - who has never coached at senior level before - caught many unawares, particularly given that Ulivieri says that Pirlo has yet to obtain his full accreditation from the Centro Tecnico Federale di Coverciano, the Italian Football Federation&rsquo;s technical centre.</p>
<p>Speaking out on Juve chairman Andrea Agnelli&rsquo;s choice, onetime and boss Ulivieri pushed back at the suggestion that the decision was a particularly risky one, hailing the World Cup winner as a &ldquo;scholar&rdquo; of the game, suggesting that his insights will stand him and his employers in good stead.</p>
<p>“Was Agnelli more courageous or reckless [in his decision]?&rdquo; he told Calcio Mercato . &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say it was realistic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure in saying that Andrea Pirlo is currently one of the most profound connoisseurs of the game of football in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about technical knowledge, as a coach. I&rsquo;m not referring to those skills acquired on the pitch, as a footballer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are another thing and offer no guarantee of success [as a coach]. Pirlo is a scholar, one who has deepened his knowledge of the subject. He is ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Asked on the situation in regards to Pirlo&rsquo;s coaching license and how he has applied himself as a student, Ulivieri added: &ldquo;He has permission to coach because he attended and completed the course, but he will only make it official in October when he delivers his thesis.</p>
<p>“[He is] careful, sharp. He is someone who looks ahead. He is always precise, someone who doesn&rsquo;t put everything down on paper. He will listen to everything and think, then write on the paper only the things he considers important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pirlo now faces a six-week wait to take charge of Juve for the first time in a competitive game following the club&rsquo;s European exit, with the new campaign set to begin on September 19.

<h3 id="real-madrid-pirlo-sees-isco-as-key-to-juventus-champions-league-win">&ldquo;Real Madrid: Pirlo sees Isco as key to Juventus Champions League win&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://as01.epimg.net/futbol/imagenes/2020/08/09/internacional/1596988065_150791_1596988222_noticia_normal.jpg" alt="img">
Juventus have tasked Andrea Pirlo with regenerating the club after the Old Lady’s Champions League elimination at the hands of Lyon, which led to the sacking of Maurizio Sarri despite the delivery of another Scudetto. It remains to be seen what style of play Pirlo will try and impose on the side after his promotion from the under-23s but it is safe to assume he will try and play attacking football and build around the goal-scoring prowess of Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
<p>The midfield is an area of the team that will require some work with the departure of Miralem Pjanic and the arrival of Arthur from Barcelona. And it could be that Juventus turn once again to Real Madrid midfielder Isco as they seek a spark of quality in the centre of the park.</p>
<p>La Gazzetta dello Sport republished a quote from Pirlo after Juventus were knocked out of the Champions League last season by Ajax: “To win the Champions League you need a player like Isco. The midfield is the key to everything; you have Cristiano but you need to find a way to ignite him.”</p>
<p>Tonali also on Pirlo&rsquo;s radar</p>
<p>Juventus have long been linked with a move for Isco, who rarely starts at Madrid with Zinedine Zidane set on his three-man midfield of Casemiro, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos. However, it seems unlikely that Juve will be able to raise the funds to land the 28-year-old in the current market conditions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic. Sporting director Fabio Paratici has previously intimated that the Old Lady may turn their attention to Italy international Sandro Tonali.</p>
<p>Tonali, 20, is one of the brightest talents in Italian football and has also attracted interest from Inter after Brescia were relegated at the end of the 2019-20 season. However, a call from Pirlo – to whom Tonali has been likened and who also started his career at Brescia - could convince the midfielder to move to Turin.

<h3 id="andrea-pirlo-the-perfect-fit-for-juventus-can-the-maestro-player-be-a-maestro-manager">&ldquo;Andrea Pirlo: The perfect fit for Juventus? Can the maestro player be a maestro manager?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/5BF0/production/_113863532_andreapirlo.jpg" alt="img">
Pirlo spent four years at Juventus as a player, from 2011-15</p>
<p>On Saturday, Juventus broke the internet, in Italy at least, when they announced the sacking of Maurizio Sarri as head coach and the hiring of Andrea Pirlo - the man without an ounce of coaching experience on his CV.</p>
<p>Pirlo, accustomed to making headlines as a legendary player for, among others, Inter Milan, AC Milan and Juventus, is now making headlines as a manager when he hasn&rsquo;t even submitted his final thesis to be called a qualified coach.</p>
<p>Pirlo? Really? The man who started chapter nine of his autobiography with the words: &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t bet a single cent on me becoming a manager though. It&rsquo;s not a job I&rsquo;m attracted to. There are too many worries…&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to have taken on the role of Juve&rsquo;s under-23 coach 10 days ago - a job without pressure - and quite another to take charge of Cristiano Ronaldo and company, while satisfying the obsessions of a side desperate for European success before the veterans retire.</p>
<p>Yet Pirlo is used to surprising us. Can the man nicknamed Maestro continue to impress us as a coach like he managed as a player?</p>
<p>Why Pirlo?</p>
<p>Since Juventus lost the Champions League final to Real Madrid in 2017, things have become a little stale.</p>
<p>They introduced Cristiano Ronaldo to excite the world and promote the Juve brand, and yet Max Allegri&rsquo;s 2018-19 team looked more boring than ever.</p>
<p>They brought in Sarri and Juve did not only continue to be boring, but they were now without the warrior spirit.</p>
<p>Chairman Andrea Agnelli realised he needs to gamble. He felt Antonio Conte was a gamble that worked, while Allegri was the hated Milan coach and yet his arrival bought even more joy.</p>
<p>So perhaps Pirlo, the former Milan maestro and Juventus legend, could bring back the Juve soul that made the team so fun to watch in the earlier seasons of this dynasty.</p>
<p>Juventus have made it clear they want to continue promoting the Juventus brand - the Juve lifestyle if you wish - to bring in a steady revenue and they want sporting brilliance that won&rsquo;t require a revolution. The bearded hipster, who played football like a god, satisfies both requirements.</p>
<p>Everyone will tune into to watch the masterful Ronaldo under the guidance of the cool Pirlo, spending their hard earned cash on the merchandise this will surely produce and perhaps Pirlo&rsquo;s suggested pragmatism will finally get this collection of individuals to play as a team.</p>
<p>Could it all end terribly?</p>
<p>Absolutely. We know so little about Pirlo as a coach that it&rsquo;s difficult to even predict.</p>
<p>As Giorgio Chiellini alluded to in his own book, great players who were &lsquo;aliens&rsquo; on the pitch such as Pirlo, have to accept they need to deal with mere mortals when they become the coach.</p>
<p>Pirlo won&rsquo;t be coaching either himself, or many players who possess his greatness - can he work with that or will it leave him frustrated?</p>
<p>Media playback is not supported on this device Andrea Pirlo scores for Italy against Ghana at the 2006 World Cup</p>
<p>But is this any more of a gamble than the decision to hire Sarri 14 months ago?</p>
<p>Sarri coached a beautiful Napoli side and had lifted the Europa League with Chelsea, but he was still a man with a specific style of play who valued the aesthetic.</p>
<p>As it transpired, the gamble won them one trophy, barely, and resulted in lots of Ronaldo eye rolls, a frustrated Leonardo Bonucci often calming Sarri down from the sidelines and endless criticism of the style of play. Sarri was truly a gamble and probably no more than Pirlo is.</p>
<p>What does Pirlo bring?</p>
<p>Pirlo may not have the coaching experience, and that will be a problem at some stage, but he has other qualities that Agnelli hopes will speed up the development of the team.</p>
<p>Pirlo understands Serie A like few others.</p>
<p>He played for Italy&rsquo;s top three teams, understands the strengths and weaknesses of them all and the culture of the various clubs that will challenge him.</p>
<p>Andrea Pirlo&rsquo;s playing career 1995-1998 Brescia 1998-2001 Inter Milan 1999-2000 Reggina (loan) 2001 Brescia (loan) 2001-2011 Inter Milan 2011-2015 Juventus 2015-2017 New York City</p>
<p>And if Ronaldo rolled his eyes when Sarri spoke, no-one will do the same when it comes to Pirlo. Like Zinedine Zidane at Real Madrid, Pirlo is a legend who has won so much and is there to be emulated and respected.</p>
<p>We know Pirlo is bound to communicate with the players better than Sarri managed, after all he knows the likes of Gianluigi Buffon, Leonardo Bonucci and Chiellini well.</p>
<p>And Pirlo has the self-confidence and belief that Juventus should always be winning, so he won&rsquo;t be expressing the sort of anxiety we regularly saw from Sarri.</p>
<p>Pirlo had only been unveiled as manager of Juventus&rsquo; under-23s on 31 July</p>
<p>In terms of play, all we can provide is conjecture. We know Pirlo wants his teams to dominate the game and have the ball at their feet, much like most modern coaches.</p>
<p>However, unlike someone like Pep Guardiola, who he respects hugely, or Gian Piero Gasperini at Atalanta, Pirlo is not convinced about making defensive sacrifices to benefit attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In military terms,&rdquo; Pirlo explained in his autobiography, &ldquo;success starts in the zone behind the lines. Put more simply, the team that concedes the fewest goals wins the match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This could be welcome relief for Juve fans who watched their side concede over 40 goals this season and lose 21 points from winning positions.</p>
<p>What issues face Pirlo at Juve?</p>
<p>Juve have many problems that need fixing, from lowering the average age of the team to introducing a balanced midfield that will not only help transport the ball to the likes of Ronaldo, but alleviate the pressure on defence.</p>
<p>Juve&rsquo;s forward line boasts excellence in Ronaldo and Paulo Dybala, plus the young Dejan Kulusevski, who is set to arrive from Parma.</p>
<p>At the back they have one of the greatest young defenders in the world in Matthijs de Ligt, two veterans in Chiellini and Bonucci who should be teaching defence at Harvard - according to Jose Mourinho - and Merih Demiral, the pride of Turkey&rsquo;s defence.</p>
<p>Where the problems arise are in the full-back positions and, most importantly, in midfield - Andrea Pirlo&rsquo;s domain. This is where Juve need his attention, his recommendations and his eye to co-ordinate.</p>
<p>However, the most important thing Pirlo needs to do is get his Juve to enjoy playing football again - this past season under Sarri has been long, tedious and overly difficult.</p>
<p>This is a team that should be enjoying the success they&rsquo;ve managed, the brilliance of their various individuals and the friendships that exist all over the club.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to have fun playing the way Liverpool do, and the way Real Madrid have over the years, and maybe, just maybe, they can win some trophies too.

Gianluigi Buffon has responded to the news that his former teammate Andrea Pirlo is now his new boss, after the former midfielder became Juventus manager.</p>
<p>The Italian champions were knocked out of the Champions League on Friday night by Ligue 1 side Lyon, in the shock result of the week, leading to Maurizio Sarri&rsquo;s sacking on Saturday.</p>
<p>In another surprise, Pirlo, who was only announced as the club&rsquo;s under 23 manager last week, was quickly named as Sarri&rsquo;s successor.</p>
<p>It means that Buffon, who signed a deal to stay in Turin until the end of next season, is now managed by his former teammate and he posted on Instagram saying, &ldquo;So now I have to call you Mister!?!?! Good luck for this new challenge Andrea!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a statement on their website Juve announced a two year deal for Pirlo, saying, &ldquo;Andrea Pirlo is the new Juventus coach. 41-years-old and born in Flero in the province of Brescia, Pirlo has had a legendary career as a player that has led him to win everything, from the Champions League to the World Cup in 2006. In his four years at the centre of the Juventus midfield, Pirlo won as many league titles, a Coppa Italia and two Italian Super Cups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, begins a new chapter of his career in the world of football, as it was said almost a week ago: from Maestro to Mister. From today he will be THE coach for people of Juventus, as the club has decided to entrust him with the technical leadership of the First Team, after having already selected him for Juventus Under 23.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The appointment means that Buffon, who left the club in 2018 for PSG but returned last year, is being managed by a man one year younger than him. Together at the Allianz Arena they won four Serie A titles and a Coppa Italia, as well as reaching the Champions League final.</p>

<p>Sarri won his first league title with the Old Lady this season, in a career spanning 30 years, and it was club&rsquo;s ninth in-a-row.</p>
<p>However the side limped over the finish line with only two wins in the final eight games and lost the final two after the title was secure to only finish one point above Inter.</p>
<p>There was already rumours that he might be sacked before the Lyon game but that loss, to a side who finished seventh in the shortened Ligue 1 season, was the final straw.</p>

<h3 id="juventus-bet-on-pirlo-becoming-new-zidane-guardiola">&ldquo;Juventus bet on Pirlo becoming new Zidane, Guardiola&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KP69hB5KbJFeZ9UD9B05mg--~B/aD01MTE7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/afp.com/2057f136506cc9db920052486689999c" alt="img">
A first coaching job and already high expectations, Andrea Pirlo&rsquo;s arrival at Juventus has sparked hopes in Italy that he can follow footballing greats Zinedine Zidane and Pep Guardiola&rsquo;s managerial success.</p>
<p>The 41-year-old former Italy and Juventus star was promoted to the top job in Turin just a week after having being appointed coach of their U23 side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andrea Pirlo is starting a path that maybe one day will lead him to the top of the first team,&rdquo; club president Andrea Agnelli said on July 31.</p>
<p>A week later, Pirlo has already taken over from Maurizio Sarri after the reigning nine-time Italian champions crashed out of the Champions League in the last 16.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A team is made up of dynamics, interpersonal relationships, expressions,&rdquo; said Agnelli on Pirlo&rsquo;s arrival at the club.</p>
<p>And Pirlo speaks the language of players, with four league titles won at Juventus between 2011 and 2015, before ending his playing career in November 2017 after three seasons in MLS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even during the years away from the club, I kept the relationships,&rdquo; said Brescia-native Pirlo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was normal for me to live in Turin and it feels normal to return to work here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I prefer to be invested with a great responsibility, it makes me feel alive,&rdquo; he explained, adding his ambition was &ldquo;to repeat the career I achieved as a player&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Contemporaries Zidane and Guardiola both achieved that feat with with Real Madrid and Barcelona.</p>
<p>But Zidane &ndash; who famously lost the 2006 World Cup final to Pirlo&rsquo;s Italy &ndash; spent two years with Real Madrid&rsquo;s B team, and Guardiola the second-tier Barcelona side, before stepping up and winning the Champions League with the first teams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guardiola and Zidane? Everyone would like to have their same journey,&rdquo; said Pirlo, &ldquo;but you need to earn it by gaining experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Napoli coach Gennaro Gattuso believes that it will be a steep climb for his former Italy and AC Milan teammate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed is he who started immediately at Juventus, I say so because this is a difficult job, it is not enough to have a great career as a footballer behind him,&rdquo; said Gattuso after Napoli were eliminated from the Champions League against Barcelona.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to study and work, we sleep little. I wish him a very big good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;Predestined&rsquo; -</li>
</ul>
<p>Pirlo&rsquo;s appointment is however seen as a natural one for Juventus whose global brand was boosted after Cristiano Ronaldo&rsquo;s 100-million-euro ($115 million) signing in 2018.</p>
<p>A sauve fashion and wine lover, Pirlo is seen as a more natural fit for the club&rsquo;s ambitions to build a globally cool lifestyle brand to attract untapped markets in North America and Asia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a very Juventus decision, very natural, we think he could be predestined, he was as a player he can become as a coach,&rdquo; said chief football officer Fabio Paratici.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In his head he has everything to succeed. He is a lad who has been with us, played with us, has always been in contact with us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in uncharted territory, no one has won nine league titles in a row, no one has had such a long cycle of victories and changes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But winning Serie A is not enough as his predecessors Massimiliano Allegri and Sarri found.</p>
<p>And how Pirlo can help Juventus achieve their biggest dream of a first Champions League title since 1996 remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Former Juventus coach Fabio Capello believes Pirlo &ldquo;has very advanced ideas about football&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a midfielder on and off the pitch, he watches and studies everything. He has had very important coaches, so he lacks nothing to do well,&rdquo; said Capello.</p>
<p>Juventus conceded 43 goals in Serie A, their highest total in nearly a decade, with Ronaldo&rsquo;s 37 goals carrying the team both at home and in Europe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my thoughts on where to put players in the middle of the night, rather than sleeping,&rdquo; said Pirlo, who also won two Champions League titles under Carlo Ancelotti at AC Milan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What form would I use? The 4-3-3, all on and off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really depends on the players available, maybe you find that they adapt better to another system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you realise that the players you thought were one way, are another way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that point you have to adapt. If you impose yourself, you waste time and they they don&rsquo;t deliver.&rdquo;</p>

The video of Pirlo sending Cristiano Ronaldo to the ground that is going viral Serie A Following his appointment as Juventus coach</p>
<p>With Andrea Pirlo being appointed as Juventus&rsquo; new coach, an old video of him going up against Cristiano Ronaldo is being shared again online.</p>
<p>Ronaldo will be Pirlo&rsquo;s star man in the Juventus dressing room, but the first time the Portuguese met the Italian he was still just a rising star at Manchester United.</p>
<p>Their first meeting came in a 2005 Champions League match at Old Trafford, that Pirlo&rsquo;s AC Milan won 1-0.</p>
<p>During that clash, Ronaldo went up against Pirlo and slid to try to block a pass up the wing, only for the midfielder to turn the other way and spread the ball across the pitch while leaving Ronaldo on the floor.</p>
<p>A video clip of that moment has been going viral since Pirlo&rsquo;s appointment.</p>
<p>In total, Pirlo and Ronaldo faced each other 12 times in competitive action, with Pirlo winning six, Ronaldo winning three and three draws.
