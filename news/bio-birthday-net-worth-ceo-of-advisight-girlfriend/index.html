<p>Usually, we consider only people famous who we see on-screen repeatedly. But, there are people who help them gain recognition. They have the power to turn anything/anyone they touch to gold. There are people who have helped celebrities reach their full potential. But, have you ever tried to find those people?</p>
<p>You might say that potential/talent is the real key to anybody’s success. Yes, indeed, it is, but it’s not everything. It’s not the only thing. Generally, there is a whole team behind a successful celebrity helping him/her along the way. That’s where BJKlock comes into the play.</p>
<p>Klock is one such person, one of the most famous men. But, you might have never heard of him. Now, you might be thinking, how come BJ Klock appears out of the blue? Who is he? All of a sudden, how did he become so famous? What exactly he did to become famous? What does he do? What is he famous for?</p>
<p>There is not much information available about him, but we will try to give you as much information as we could retrieve from various sources. He has a little secretive and complicated life. Here, we are providing you information about his personal life, education, profession, net worth, relationship (girlfriend/wife), etc.</p>
<p>Who is BJ Klock and how did he become famous?</p>
<p>BJ (first name Brian) Klock is an entrepreneur, investor, musician, and record producer. The 30-year-old man seems to be one-man-army who is doing it all. He is the founder and CEO of Advisight. Its website describes the company as the “world’s premier market research center.”</p>
<p>Located/headquartered in Los Angeles, Advisight is a management company successfully managing a network of over 500 million people. The firm’s and BJ Klock’s claim to fame is being the company billionaires, brands, and the super famous people who hire them to increase their social presence.</p>
<p>The company’s website claims itself to be an expert in building global influence and capturing long term attention by creating a loyal-super fan base for brands around the world.</p>
<p>Born on February 19, 1990, Klock has written an article on Medium. It says that Klock has enabled some of the world’s most influential personal and corporate brands to dramatically increase visibility, revenue, and profitability for their brand. It also states that BJ is one of the “original influencers in personal development and digital marketing.</p>
<p>In the same article, he has claimed to have accumulated over a million loyal fans for himself. Apart from it, he has built a network of over 500 million followers which received over 100s of billions of views and trillions of impressions on an annual basis. BJ Klock got rich by increasing the brand’s and celeb’s social presence.</p>
<p>Why is it so hard to find information on BJ Klock, if he is so famous?</p>
<p>It sounds confusing, isn’t it? It’s because it kind of is. BJ doesn’t disclose everything that he does and how he does it. He likes to keep a bit of secrecy in his work. You should note that on one hand, he knows how to increase the brand’s visibility. And, on the other hand, he knows how to keep the specifics out of the public domain.</p>
<p>In the year 2017, BJ Klock got famous as he was named as one of the 30 Under 30. Also, he was recognized by Success magazine as of the World’s Best Entrepreneurs. But, it’s not all. Everything about him is not known publicly. There is a lot of information that is not known yet.</p>
<p>But, maybe that’s part of his fame—his secrecy? It seems like this “influencer” prefers to influence quietly.</p>
<p>BJ &amp; his book – How to Get Started When You Got Nothing</p>
<p>In 2020, BJ Klock published an e-book titled “How To Get Started When You Got Nothing“. In this book, he has written/explained his experience and journey how he got started from humble beginnings.</p>
<p>He hasn’t revealed or opened up about his career’s journey publicly, but he shared it through his book. It describes him his journey of becoming one of the world’s most influential businessman.</p>
<p>BJ is a consultant to billionaires, multi-millionaires, CEOs, TV Stars, Professional Athletes, Global Influencers &amp; Celebrities.</p>
<p>Is BJ Klock married? Relationship Status – Girlfriend/Wife</p>
<p>Klock likes to flaunt his career achievements, but on the other hand, he doesn’t like to share about his love life. He hasn’t spoken one time regarding his marital or relationship status. So, we don’t know if he is married or if he is dating someone at the moment. But, it’s a fair question to ask as he has been seen wearing a ring on that specific finger.</p>
<p>During our research, we found one website claiming that BJ Klock is married, but his social profile doesn’t give any evidence to prove the same. Moreover, we couldn’t find any personal photos of him with his potential romantic partner. On the other note, it seems to be plausible that the ring could be only for decorative purpose as he doesn’t wear all the time.</p>
<p>So, we couldn’t conclude anything in specific. It seems that BJ is either single or keeping his love life away from the public eyes.</p>
<p>Will BJ Klock (Net Worth) be richer than Jeff Bezos (Amazon)?</p>
<p>As of 2020, as per the reports, BJ Klock’s net worth of just under $100 million. It is quite amazing and encouraging how BJ has got a huge success and financial growth at such a young age.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos aka the richest man in the world, as of 2020, has a net worth of more than $165.2 billion. It has been reported several times that he is very well on his way of becoming the first trillionaire in the world.</p>
<p>So, it is quite clear that Klock has a long stretch to reach closer to Jeff Bezos, let alone surpass it, anytime soon.

<p>Watch This offers movie recommendations inspired by new releases, premieres, current events, or occasionally just our own inscrutable whims. This week: With Jon Stewart’s Irresistible headed for home-viewing platforms—and with November 3 on the horizon—we’re looking back at other films about elections or political campaigns.</p>
<p>State Of The Union (1948)</p>
<p>Frank Capra always sided with the everyman, the hard-working guy in the street, the quintessential American. Even when he traded the salt-of-the-earth types of You Can’t Take It With You or It’s A Wonderful Life for politics in Mr. Smith Goes To Washington or Meet John Doe, there was still an honorable character at the center played by somebody like Jimmy Stewart or Gary Cooper. Which makes Capra’s Wonderful Life follow-up, State Of The Union, an outlier. The movie pulls back the curtain on the most important race in the country—a presidential campaign—to expose a candidate who’s flawed from the get-go. This only makes it easier for him to be seduced, both literally and figuratively, into tossing his ideals aside on his ambitious climb to the White House.</p>
<p>Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1945 play, State Of The Union quickly introduces Spencer Tracy’s Grant Matthews, a self-made aircraft tycoon who’s far from an everyman. Nevertheless, he’s described by his mistress, the conniving newspaper heiress Kaye Thorndyke (Angela Lansbury), as having the ideal “combination of sincerity and drive that the common herd will go for. They think he’s one of them. He thinks he’s one of them.” Thanks to Kaye’s fierce ambition, the noble yet adulterous Grant is soon lured into a political career, even though it means reconciling with his estranged wife, Mary (played by Tracy’s frequent co-star and longtime romantic partner Katharine Hepburn), to present a united front on a speaking tour.</p>
<p>Grant stays away from the smoke-filled rooms where his ambitious candidacy is plotted by hatless men in rolled-up shirtsleeves swapping favors and counting delegates. Capra shows how a nobody citizen can be turned into a somebody candidate. In 1948, with a then-unpopular Harry Truman in the Oval Office and the Democrats recently losing the House for the first time in years, Grant is gunning for the Republican candidacy. Kaye is ready to wage her entire press empire to get him elected, warning her editors to keep Dewey et al. at each others’ throats to let this “dark horse candidate” through, à la the election efforts of presidential hopeful Wendell Willkie. (The then-23-year-old Lansbury is stunning, holding her own against veteran stars like Tracy and Hepburn. Also great: heartthrob Van Johnson in a rare character role as a wise-cracking journalist.)</p>
<p>While Grant starts out with big ideas/ideals, he soon learns that he’s not going to be able to please all of the people all of the time. When he gets some harsh reviews from either side, he runs straight to the safe, less controversial middle, to the delight of his manipulative handlers and the horror of his honest wife. As Capra favorite Charles Lane’s character comments after reading one of Grant’s speeches, “He must be bowlegged from straddling.” That’s the moral quandary inherent in a candidacy: Is it worth doing whatever it takes to get elected, even if you drop some scruples along the way? If everyone has to make all these deals just to get their name on the ballot, do we ever elect anyone really honorable? “Don’t you want Grant to be a good president?” Hepburn’s Mary asks Adolphe Menjou, playing the main political operative behind her husband’s campaign. “Mary, a good president is one who gets elected,” he replies.</p>
<p>This being a Capra film, Grant doesn’t stay on the dark side long. Although temporarily blinded by the White House gleam, he eventually realizes his campaign is preying on hatred and fear, playing to the lowest common denominator—a sentiment that sounds way too familiar today. Tracy’s Grant offers some platitudes that are difficult to hear given the current political climate, especially when he says, “I forgot how quickly Americans smell out the double-dealers and the crooks.” Well, we used to, anyway. Capra’s films always held up a lofty black-and-white mirror to the way America should be (he doesn’t hold anything back here, blasting “America The Beautiful” over the opening credits), with the ultimate power hopefully belonging to the people (George Bailey) and not the corrupt fat cats (Mr. Potter). It’s an ideal we took a horrible turn from in the last election, which makes State Of The Union a valuable if dated reminder of what this country is supposed to stand for.</p>
<p>Availability: State Of The Union is available to purchase digitally from Amazon, VUDU, and Fandango.

EOBs live band on these four dates and the upcoming tour will be comprised of Hinako Omori, Ross Chapman, Dishan Abrahams and Alvin Ford, Jr.. Ed recently unveiled the first sights and sounds from his debut under the EOB moniker, in the form of the song Brasil. Described by STEREOGUM as a nine-minute shapeshifting epic, Brasil begins life as a plaintive ballad built on the bare bones of OBriens voice and acoustic guitar before blooming into a pulsing motorik driver that beats out into space (CONSEQUENCE OF SOUND). Brasil was also adapted into a nine-minute short film, bringing to life a concept by Ed and director Andrew Donoho thatin the words of ROLLING STONEshows humanity coming together after Earth is visited by an alien power.

After graduating from Toronto&rsquo;s Humber College jazz program, Willis became active in the city&rsquo;s music scene, eventually expanding beyond its limits to work with a variety of different acts like David Crosby, Zac Brown Band, and Parachute Club, among others. A 2009 collaboration with acclaimed Toronto roots band the Henrys led Willis to form a new group with Henrys&rsquo; slide guitarist Don Rooke and veteran violinist Hugh Marsh. As Three Metre Day, the trio recorded the 2012 album Coasting Notes and scored the 2013 independent film Still Mine, the latter of which earned them a best original score nomination from the Canadian Screen Awards. During one of their tours, Willis and the band befriended an unlikely ally in former Iggy and the Stooges guitarist James Williamson, who eventually brought them out to California for some shows and enlisted them to play on Pop&rsquo;s 2013 album Ready to Die.

<p>The best guitar player Ive heard in maybe my entire life is floating around now, Pasquale Grasso - Pat Metheny, Vintage Guitar MagazineBorn in Italy and now based in New York City, the 30-year- old guitarist has developed an astounding technique and concept informed not by jazz guitarists so much as by bebop pioneers like Powell, Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie and the classical-guitar tradition. His new digital-only EP series, available beginning in June from Sony Masterworks, showcases Grasso in the solo-guitar format, where his intensive studies of both mid-century jazz and classical meld into a signature mastery that is, remarkably, at once unprecedented and evocative.</p>

<p>Amuse presents Antigone - St Ignatius of Antioch</p>
<p>February 11, 2020 - Manhattan</p>
<p>Amuse Singers is thrilled to present the NY premiere of James Kallembachs haunting oratorio Antigone as part of our 2019-2020 Season.

Antigones exploration of unrest and the individual at odds with the state is as timely as ever, and it is a striking example of a necessary and ongoing commitment by womens ensembles to contribute to the currently underrepresented body of womens choral literature. The program also includes Joshua Shank&rsquo;s arrangement of Saro and Mary Montgomery Koppel&rsquo;s Mother of Exiles. All works were originally commissioned by the vanguard and visionary Boston-based women&rsquo;s ensemble, Lorelei. The concerts will take place on Sunday February 9 at 4 pm at St Johns Episcopal Church at 139 St. Johns Place in Brooklyn, and on Tuesday February 11 at 7:30 pm at St. Ignatius of Antioch at 552 West End Avenue in Manhattan. Advance tickets are $18 and can be purchased at <a href="http://www.amusesingers.org">www.amusesingers.org</a>. Tickets at the door are $25/$20 for students and seniors.</p>

<p>fireflyfestival.com Billed as “the East Coast’s Premier Music Experience,” Firefly features 100-plus acts for fans of pop, especially electronic/dance-pop, to enjoy. Florence &amp; The Machine is a headliner — sharing top-billing with Mumford &amp; Sons, Kings of Leon and DeadMau5. Other highlights include Ellie Goulding, Disclosure, Chvrches, Of Monsters and Men, AlunaGeorge and Elle King. Earth Wind &amp; Fire surely is the oldest act, although Death Cab for Cutie, Blink-182 and Ludacris are other veterans part of the four-day festival, with the schedules per day and per stage, to be released later. Like any good festival, an untold number of Firefly’s bubbling-under acts have the potential to become your next favorite band — Parson James, Rufus du Sol and St. Lucia among them.

<h3 id="ariana-fletcher-wiki-age-and-facts-about-g-herbos-ex-girlfriend-and-baby-mama">&ldquo;Ariana Fletcher Wiki, Age and Facts About G Herbo’s Ex-Girlfriend and Baby Mama&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.earnthenecklace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ariana-Fletcher-Wiki-Age-and-Facts-About-G-Herbo%E2%80%99s-Ex-Girlfriend-and-Baby-Mama.jpg" alt="img">
Ariana Fletcher may have initially risen to fame for being rapper G Herbo’s ex-girlfriend and baby mama, but she’s made incredible strides of her own since the couple’s unpleasant and very public breakup. Read our Ariana Fletcher wiki to find out everything you need to know about the Instagram star, model, and self-made entrepreneur.</p>
<p>About Ariana Fletcher Age 24 Years Birth July 12, 1995 Chicago, Illinois Gender Female Children Yosohn Santana Siblings Kyle, Ashley Brands KYChe Extensions</p>
<p>To her fans, she’s known as Ari. But her full name is Ariana Fletcher. Born on July 12, 1995 in Chicago, Illinois, Ariana Fletcher has already made a very well-known name for herself. Our Ariana Fletcher wiki tells you everything there is to know about G Herbo’s ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p>Ariana Fletcher Had a Difficult Childhood</p>
<p>By the looks of it, Ariana Fletcher had a somewhat troubled home life growing up. Apparently, she had a very strained relationship with her father and the two have been estranged from one another for a very long time. Although she’s still very close with her mother and sister Ashley, aka creolemiss, not much is known about them.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Ariana Fletcher also had an older brother named Kyle who she was very close with, but he allegedly died when she very young. The cause of his death is unknown and Ariana has made it abundantly clear that she doesn’t like talking about her brother because it’s too painful. To pay tribute to him, she got a tattoo of his face on her left shoulder.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Ariana loved her brother so much that she even named her Instagram handle “therealkylesister.” Her current profile picture is a cute shot of the two of them in a swimming pool as kids.</p>
<p>Also Read: Schuyler Helford Wiki, Facts About Josh Groban’s Girlfriend</p>
<p>Ariana struggled a lot in high school, presumably after losing her brother in an unexpected way. Eventually, she ended up dropping out after dating one of her female classmates. After exploring her sexuality, Ariana decided that dating women wasn’t the right thing for her.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Shortly after dropping out of high school, she began waitressing at Adrianna’s Night Club in Chicago. Around that same time, her Instagram modeling career began taking off.</p>
<p>In addition to posting very risqué pictures of herself in skimpy outfits, Ariana also likes sharing pictures of herself with her son for her fans to admire, while also taking pointed jabs at her baby daddy, G Herbo, in the descriptions.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>This one is captioned: “Halloween is cancelled, Papa not feeling it.” While she could just be referring to the solemn expression on son Yosohn’s face, she could also be referring to G Herbo possibly not wanting to spend Halloween with his son.</p>

<p>G Herbo and Ariana Fletcher’s Rocky Relationship Made Headlines</p>
<p>G Herbo and Ariana Fletcher reportedly started dating sometime in 2012 and their son Yosohn Santana was born in April 2018. Allegedly, the couple broke up shortly thereafter, amid rumors that he was cheating on her with none other than rapper Fabolous’ stepdaughter, Taina Williams.</p>
<p>Their breakup was tumultuous, to say the least. Despite previous allegations of abuse against her rapper ex-boyfriend, Ariana reportedly dropped the charges and decided to allow G Herbo to spend more time with his son. But not before having him arrested following a serious altercation earlier this year.</p>
<p>In a since-deleted tweet, Ariana explained what happened, saying, “He kicked my door down to get in my house because I wouldn’t let him in, beat the f*** out of me front of my son then he took my son outside to his friends and had then drive off with my son.” She continued to describe the assault in graphic detail. She deleted the post from her Instagram account, but not before fans had time to screenshot it.</p>
<p>Ariana and G Herbo allegedly had an agreement that he could spend time with his son as long as his new girlfriend wasn’t around. When the rapper posted pics of Taina and Yosohn together in the same room celebrating his 24th birthday, that’s when things hit the fan once again.</p>
<p>In another since-deleted, expletive-laden Instagram post, Ariana held no prisoners as she seriously called her ex and Taina out for the whole world to see with numerous defamatory allegations against both of them, much to the delight of her fans.</p>
<p>Lmfaooooo Ari not playing with Herb ass 😭 pic.twitter.com/TBfxaaBdPi — Lex Thee MUA 🦄 (@lexthemua_) October 9, 2019</p>
<p>She wrote:</p>
<p>“NOW IM TAKING IT ALL THE WAY THERE. I try to be a cool a** baby mama, let you get my son even tho you don’t ever even get him foreal for whatever reason. I helped you get your cases dropped so you couldn’t go to jail. I be being so cool with you and you really done pushed me past my mf limit now, MY SON B****? IS YOU ON DOPE? Cause when I just checked you and this b**** the other day y’all swore that wasn’t my baby but this s*** is CLEAR AS F****** DAY MY SON! You dumb broke crybaby b****. I asked you to not have my son around this h**. I told you to your face not to have him around this lame a** h** and yo h** a** agreed and said you and her know better ain’t no disrespecting me when it come to my son. N**** you swore on all yo dead homies you don’t have my son around. Stupid b**** sitting here with her face frowned up while you got my son. The b**** used to f*** bibby, she’s a c** rag a**, wanna be wifey a**, tryna luck up a** h**. Please lie and say s*** didn’t so I can post it. You wifed a h** that wanna pretend to be a good girl shorty a** is a professional side b**** that you fell for. How you wife a h** that f***** with one of yo main homies. Yo h** so f****** slow she gives you 24 rolled woods full of weed and you just got out of a f****** drug program 2 weeks ago. AIR HEAD!”</p>
<p>It suffices to say that Ariana is probably a lot better off without that kind of drama in her life. For a while, she was dating American professional boxer Gervonta Davis, but it appears that the couple broke up earlier this year after Ariana celebrated her son’s first birthday with her baby daddy G Herbo.</p>
<p>Gervonta even went as far as deleting all pictures of him and Ariana from his Instagram account, and she quickly followed suit. She also called him out on Twitter, stating that he’s “a b****,” but deleted the tweet.</p>
<p>In a recent video on her YouTube channel called TheRealKyleSister, she stated that she’s “not dating anyone” and she’s “100% single.” She went on to say, “I don’t wanna start dating no time soon” and “I just need time for myself. I need time for me and I don’t wanna jump back into nothing.”</p>
<p>She Has Her Own Hair Extension Company</p>
<p>Ariana started her own hair extension company with her cousin, Britney. Although Ariana is the face of the company and does a lot of the promotions online through her various social media channels, Britney handles the business’s management and finances.</p>
<p>When asked about the inspiration behind her company name, Ariana said, “So me and my cousin, we was talkin’ ‘bout it cuz I always liked to wear my hair in different colors, like different styles and s***.” People were always complimenting her unique hairstyles so she figured she “might as well start selling [her] own s***.”</p>
<p>The name KyChe is a combination of Kyle—Ariana Fletcher’s brother’s name—and Che, his son’s name. For more information on KyChe, check out the KyChe Extensions Instagram and the company website. But be forewarned, because some of the images on the homepage are definitely NSFW!</p>

About Carmen Flood Age 23 Years Birth January 23, 1997 Gender Female Parents Melanie Kareem, Steve Flood Address Topanga, California Country United States Nationality American Job Actor Alumni Carnegie Mellon University, Malibu High School Hometown Malibu, California Shows Brews Brothers</p>
<p>Netflix’s comedy library has an entertaining new show—Brews Brothers—that’s premiering on April 10. The show will follow two brothers who want to create the best beer and save their family’s brewery business. Carmen Flood joins the cast of Brews Brothers in the first major role of her career. Her character, Sarah, is a friend of the brothers, whose two very different personalities force her to play the go-between in their conflicts. Before this talent-to-watch gets too famous to keep up with, we’ve got Carmen Flood’s wiki with all her deets.</p>
<p>Carmen Flood Learned Belly Dancing from Her Mom</p>
<p>Carmen Flood was born on January 23, 1997 to Steve Flood and Melanie Kareem. The California girl grew up in Malibu, where she played soccer at Malibu High School.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Happy Golden birthday today, my amazing daughter! Turning 23 years old on January 23! Posted by Melanie Kareem on Thursday, January 23, 2020</p>
<p>Carmen Flood’s parents aren’t together. It seems that Carmen spent most of her childhood with her mom.</p>
<p>Melanie Kareem is married to a musician named Jamie Papish.</p>
<p>Kareem owns and runs the Melanie Kareem Middle Eastern Dance School in Topanga Canyon. She teaches belly dancing, so Carmen Flood grew up learning the dance style.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>According to her resume, Flood has over a decade’s experience as a professional belly dancer. She also played the clarinet for nine years.</p>

<p>Flood Studied Acting at Carnegie Mellon</p>
<p>Carmen Flood excelled in music, dance, and athletics in school. And after graduating from high school in 2015, she was ready to put another feather in her cap by studying acting at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).</p>
<p>Before she graduated in 2019 with a BFA in acting, Flood gained theater experience and even got to channel her playwright and poet skills. Besides acting in CMU productions, she was the playwright behind a production called E.P.A.P at CMU.</p>

<p>Brews Brothers Is Flood’s First Big Role</p>
<p>While she was a student at CMU, Flood participated in theater productions. But she also has some on-camera experience.</p>
<p>She worked in short films like Dog and Antonio Bellaire. She even did a Red Cross PSA. Since returning to California from Pittsburgh, Flood has already secured her big break in a Netflix series.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Flood is part of the main cast of Brews Brothers, a comedy series on Netflix. The series stars Alan Aisenberg and Mike Castle as the titular brothers who have nothing in common except their desire to create the perfect brew and save their family business.</p>
<p>Their polar opposite personalities are connected by Flood’s character Sarah, a mutual friend who tries to resolve their differences even though they can never seem to find common ground. This role is certainly going to get Carmen Flood noticed and bring her more acting jobs in the future.</p>
