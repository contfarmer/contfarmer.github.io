<p>Media playback is not supported on this device Kilmarnock and Celtic share the spoils at Rugby Park in the Scottish Premiership.</p>
<p>Chris Burke&rsquo;s penalty earned Kilmarnock a deserved Scottish Premiership draw with reigning champions Celtic.</p>
<p>The visitors could not build on Ryan Christie&rsquo;s free-kick that flew by goalkeeper Danny Rogers from 35 yards.</p>
<p>Striker Nicke Kabamba was hauled down by Celtic centre-half Christopher Jullien and Burke beat debutant keeper Vasilas Barkas from the spot.</p>
<p>Celtic dominated possession and Killie were dangerous on the break, but neither could add to the scoreline.</p>
<p>Alex Dyer&rsquo;s hosts have now not won in seven outings stretching into last season, but will be pleased to have ended a run of six consecutive defeats to the Glasgow side.</p>
<p>Celtic had beaten Kilmarnock 3-1 three times last season, but Neil Lennon&rsquo;s side on this occasion had to settle for stretching their undefeated run away from home to 13 games.</p>
<p>Dyer had looked to the experience of Gary Dicker in midfield, picking the Irishman ahead of Greg Kiltie, but the holding midfielder paid the price of a professional foul on Odsonne Edouard as Christie fired home the free-kick from what was Celtic&rsquo;s first effort on goal.</p>
<p>Former Aberdeen goalkeeper Rogers made his debut at half-time last week as a replacement for fellow summer signing Jake Eastwood and looked to be deceived by the flight of the ball as the Scotland midfielder&rsquo;s strike from all of 35 yards found the inside of a post.</p>
<p>Kilmarnock refused to be knocked out of their stride and centre-half Jullien was at fault as the hosts levelled.</p>
<p>He allowed Rory McKenzie to push him off the ball on the touchline and, when the pass was played through to Kabamba, the big striker wriggled clear of the Frenchman before being man-handled to the ground.</p>
<p>Barkas was rarely under threat again on his debut, but the Greek goalkeeper&rsquo;s despairing fingertips could not prevent Burke finding the corner from the penalty spot for the winger&rsquo;s second goal in two games.</p>
<p>In the other goal, although a foul was eventually given, Rogers redeemed himself with a fine late save to deny last weekend&rsquo;s hat-trick hero, Edouard.</p>
<p>What did we learn?</p>
<p>A few eyebrows have been raised by Dyer&rsquo;s preference for Englishman Kabamba ahead of Scotland striker Eamonn Brophy two weeks running.</p>
<p>But the big former Hartlepool United 27-year-old justified his selection, roughing up Jullien and fellow centre-half Kristoffer Ajer in a way that few have previously. If he can continue that form, and the evergreen Burke can continue to inspire on the wing, a long-awaited win must surely be on the cards soon.</p>
<p>Celtic started the season last weekend in a style you would expect of a side aiming for a 10th league title in a row, but their famed fighting spirit was missing on this occasion and it is rare sight to see a Neil Lennon side being bullied by the opposition.</p>
<p>Some have suggested that Celtic are an unstoppable juggernaut on the way to a historic milestone, but Kilmarnock have shown that 10 in a row is not a foregone conclusion and that others in the Premiership might have something to say about that.</p>
<p>Man of the match - Nicke Kabamba</p>
<p>Nicke Kabamba won the penalty and bullied the Celtic defence throughout</p>
<p>What did they say?</p>
<p>Media playback is not supported on this device Kilmarnock: Nicke Kabamba &lsquo;is a joy to watch&rsquo; - Alex Dyer</p>
<p>Kilmarnock manager Alex Dyer: &ldquo;They gave 100% and were calm even when they went a goal down. We had a little spell after the goal went in when we panicked a little bit, but we weathered the storm and I thought we were quite comfortable. There is no need to blame the goalkeeper - he knows it&rsquo;s a long way out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Media playback is not supported on this device Celtic: There&rsquo;s a bit of rust there - Neil Lennon</p>
<p>Celtic manager Neil Lennon: &ldquo;We knew it would be a tough place to come. So we have to take the point and move on - it&rsquo;s not the end of the world. There were aspects to our game we could do better - particularly second half we had all the ball but just lacked finishing touch, our final ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>Kilmarnock will hope to build on the draw but will not get it easy as the visit a Ross County side on Wednesday who have opened with two straight wins.</p>
<p>Celtic are also on their travels again and will be hopeful of taking out their frustration on St Mirren, who lost 3-0 away to Rangers earlier.

<h3 id="kilmarnock-1-1-celtic-chris-burke-penalty-sees-celtic-drop-points-in-second-scottish-premiership-game">&ldquo;Kilmarnock 1-1 Celtic: Chris Burke penalty sees Celtic drop points in second Scottish Premiership game&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.skysports.com/assets/favicon.ico" alt="img">
Chris Burke&rsquo;s penalty gave Kilmarnock a deserved 1-1 draw with Celtic, as the champions dropped points in only the second game of the season.</p>
<p>Neil Lennon&rsquo;s team got off to the perfect start at Rugby Park, taking an 11th-minute lead when stand-in Kilmarnock goalkeeper Danny Rogers was beaten cheaply by Ryan Christie&rsquo;s long-range free-kick.</p>
<p>But with Christopher Jullien struggling to deal with Kilmarnock&rsquo;s physical forward play all afternoon, he hauled down Nicke Kabamba in the Celtic box allowing Burke to step up from 12 yards and level up from the spot (24).</p>
<p>Player ratings Kilmarnock: Rogers (7), Millen (7), Broadfoot (8), Findlay (8), Waters (6), Power (7), Dicker (7), Tshibola (7), McKenzie (6), Burke (7), Kabamba (8).</p>
<p>Subs: Haunstrup (6), Kiltie (n/a).</p>
<p>Celtic: Barkas (7), Frimpong (6), Jullien (4), Ajer (6), Taylor (6), Brown (5), McGregor (6), Forrest (6), Christie (7), Elyounoussi (5), Edouard (5).</p>
<p>Subs: Kimala (6), Elhamed (5), Ntcham (n/a), Bolingoli (n/a).</p>
<p>Man of the match: Nicke Kabamba</p>
<p>After the break, Celtic enjoyed near-total dominance of the ball but did not once force Rogers into a difficult save, as Kilmarnock&rsquo;s stubborn defending led them to a well-earned draw for their first points of the season.</p>
<p>Kilmarnock show grit to hold champions</p>
<p>After last weekend&rsquo;s thumping win over Hamilton, while Kilmarnock were getting beaten at Hibernian, it would have been no surprise if Celtic flew out of the blocks at Rugby Park - but against a well-drilled and physical Killie side, they found life tough.</p>
<p>It had been the hosts making the early ground, as Kabamba caught out Jullien and broke with less than two minutes on the clock before Kristoffer Ajer bailed out his defensive partner.</p>
<p>Image: Ryan Christie netted his first goal of the season</p>
<p>But with their first sight of goal, Celtic showed their clinical touch. Back-up goalkeeper Rogers should have done better with Christie&rsquo;s 35-yard free-kick, which he was late to dive for and could only watch it sail past him.</p>
<p>But 11 minutes later, his blushes were spared. Kabamba again gave Jullien problems, this time on the byline in the Celtic box, and was then hauled down by the Frenchman.</p>
<p>Team news Kilmarnock made two changes from their defeat at Hamilton, with Danny Rogers replacing injured goalkeeper Jake Eastwood, and Gary Dicker taking Greg Kiltie&rsquo;s place in midfield.</p>
<p>Celtic&rsquo;s only alteration also came in goal, with Scott Bain dropped for debutant Vasilis Barkas.</p>
<p>There was little surprise when a penalty followed, and even less so when Burke beat Celtic debutant Vasilis Barkas with an excellently taken spot-kick.</p>
<p>Celtic continued to give Killie right-back Ross Millen too much space to send in fine deliveries from the flank, with Kabamba nodding two crosses over Barkas&rsquo; bar, while Odsonne Edouard fired a free-kick just wide of Rogers&rsquo; post from 20 yards.</p>
<p>Image: Chris Burke levelled from the spot after Christie&rsquo;s early opener</p>
<p>After the break, the champions showed signs of increasing their intensity and tempo, but it did not last. After Edouard fired over from outside the box, they did not come close to testing Rogers again until Callum McGregor&rsquo;s long-range effort whistled over the bar nearly 20 minutes later.</p>
<p>Kilmarnock showed glimpses of danger on the counter-attack without ever providing Barkas any major worries on his Celtic bow, but held on resolutely for a first point of the season, and leave Celtic frustrated and already off the early pace-setters.</p>
<p>What the managers said&hellip;</p>
<p>Kilmarnock manager Alex Dyer: &ldquo;We had to put in a disciplined performance, and after going a goal down, we lost it after they scored for a few minutes, but then we were back in the game with the penalty and saw the game out quite comfortably.</p>
<p>2:06 Kilmarnock manager Alex Dyer said his side saw out the second half against Celtic quite comfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These boys have been here before, they know what it&rsquo;s about, they showed good discipline, and I know the players I&rsquo;ve got in there, the way they work, that we could get over that initial 10 minutes after the goal and after that we were fine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We said at half-time, stay in the game, that was our motto for the last few seasons, it gives ourselves a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Celtic boss Neil Lennon: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re disappointed not to win the game. We had enough of the ball, we&rsquo;ve given away a poor goal, but we&rsquo;ve dominated the second half, and just lacked a bit of penetration.</p>
<p>1:44 Neil Lennon says his side are disappointed not to get more from the game but admits their final ball was not good enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kilmarnock defended very, very well at times as well though. We never scored from open play, we scored a great goal from a free-kick, but let them back into the game and gave them oxygen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second half was all us, but we just lacked that bit of quality on the day. We&rsquo;ve dropped two points, if you want to look at it that way, but it could be an important point going forward, this is a tough place to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Man of the match - Nicke Kabamba</p>
<p>Kilmarnock knew Celtic&rsquo;s defensive weak spot and took full advantage of it. Kabamba took on more duels than anyone on the pitch - more than double, in fact (31). While he won just under half, he was a constant annoyance for Jullien and Ajer and regularly got the better of them.</p>
<p>He will wish his finishing could have been slightly better from two good Millen crosses before the break, but he more than played his part in Burke&rsquo;s equaliser by winning the penalty his team-mate tucked away in a performance of real effort and quality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was excellent from start to finish,&rdquo; his manager Dyer told Sky Sports after the game. &ldquo;He ran the two boys who are good players ragged at times, no one likes to defend when balls are being turned, but he&rsquo;s big, he&rsquo;s strong, he&rsquo;s got a great touch and he&rsquo;s a handful for any defender in this division.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>Kilmarnock travel to Ross County on Wednesday; Kick-off at 7.45pm, before hosting St Johnstone next weekend.</p>
<p>Celtic have another away trip to St Mirren next up, live on Sky Sports Football on Wednesday from 5pm; Kick-off at 6pm.

<p>Celtic got off to a flying start in their Premiership opener as they dispatched Hamilton 5-1.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;ll be hoping to keep that momentum going as they face Kilmarnock on Sunday.</p>
<p>Rugby Park has been notoriously a tricky hunting ground for the Hoops in recent seasons so they know they&rsquo;ll be in for a tough afternoon.</p>
<p>Neil Lennon deployed a full strength team against Accies as Odsonne Edouard bagged a hat-trick to mark flag day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unlikely the Celtic boss will make wholesale changes, but they do have a midweek game against St Mirren to think of.</p>
<p>For more Celtic news join our new group Celtic Live - News, transfer rumours and chat from Celtic Park</p>
<p>Lennon also revealed Greg Taylor picked up an ankle problem, which could bring Boli Bolingoli into the equation or force the Hoops manager into making some tactical changes.</p>
<p>Leigh Griffiths has also been ruled out with a calf strain as Vasilis Barkas looks to make his debut for the club.</p>

<p>Celtic fans are pleased with the news that Vasilis Barkas will make his debut for the club today, but some have expressed their frustration at Olivier Ntcham only making the bench.</p>
<p>The Greek keeper comes into the starting lineup for today&rsquo;s match against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park, with Scott Bain dropping down to the bench.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only change to the side that beat Hamilton Accies 5-1 at Celtic Park last weekend, with Ntcham named among the substitutes and no place for Leigh Griffiths in Neil Lennon&rsquo;s squad.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what fans have been saying about the XI.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excited to see Barkas in the purple jersey&rdquo; - @seanie_bhoy</p>
<p>&ldquo;Solid team. Great to see Barkas get his debut&rdquo; - @MarkDowne2</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good to see Barkas starting&rdquo; - @kpfrencheddie</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good to see Barkas in, Lennon clearly got faith early on. Still think it’s harsh that Ntcham isn’t getting a start but there could be worse starting than Christie I suppose&rdquo; - @LewisLaird01</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn’t blame Ntcham if he wanted to leave&rdquo; - @Ciaran8867</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ntcham masterclass off the bench&rdquo; - @_aidenmcgarr</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barkas making his debut today against Kilmarnock, excited to see what he&rsquo;s all about&rdquo; - @cheesybiscuit_</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barkas starts but no Ntcham so we have to riot&rdquo; - @mCeltic93</p>
<p>LINEUP</p>
<p>STARTING XI : Barkas,Jullien, Taylor, Brown, Christie, Edouard, Elyounoussi, Frimpong, Ajer, McGregor, Forrest</p>
<p>SUBS : Bain, Bitton, Klimala, Soro, Ntcham, Bolingoli, Robertson, Elhamed, Karamoko
