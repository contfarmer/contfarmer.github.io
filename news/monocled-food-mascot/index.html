<p>Charles Entertainment Cheese</p>
<p>Georgesheldon/Dreamstime.com</p>
<p>Charles Entertainment Cheese was orphaned as a small mouse, and no one knew when his birthday was, so he never had a birthday party. After winning $50 in a Pong tournament, he bought a one-way ticket to New York and slept in the ceiling of a pizzeria. When the chef discovered him and his incredible singing voice, he changed the name of his restaurant to Chuck E. Cheese, and Charles sang for families all night. Rumor has it, he hasn’t stopped smiling since. If you think that origin story is wild, wait until you find out where your favorite cocktails come from.</p>

<h3 id="5-other-food-mascots-that-need-to-die-now-that-we-finally-killed-mr-peanut">&ldquo;5 other food mascots that need to die now that we finally killed Mr. Peanut&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&amp;c=sc&amp;poi=face&amp;w=2000&amp;h=1047&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F01%2Fgettyimages-672180900-2000.jpg" alt="img">
Mr. Peanut is gone — and now it&rsquo;s time to finish off some of his annoying peers.</p>
<p>The internet was rocked today by the tragic (and Super Bowl ad-induced) death of Mr. Peanut, who served as the monocle-wearing mascot of Planters Peanuts since 1916. While Planters killed Mr. Peanut as part of a marketing ploy, the murder got us thinking… What other animated food mascots need to be taken behind the shed and put down? This question prompted a long (and rather disturbing) thread in EW’s slack chat, but we eventually managed to narrow down our kill list to five primary offenders.</p>
<p>Image zoom</p>
<p>Chester Cheetah</p>
<p>Though he no longer rhymes incessantly, this Cheetos spokescat still wears sunglasses indoors and now speaks with a British accent that he randomly developed later in life. Plus, Chester is just woefully off-brand. Cheetos are a lot of things — delicious, messy, devoid of any nutritional value — but no one has ever equated the dusty orange crunch-sticks with “cool.”</p>
<p>Image zoom General Mills</p>
<p>The Trix Rabbit</p>
<p>This hopped-up bunny has been scheming to get his paws on a bowl of fruit-shaped sugar nuggets since 1959 — and he’s been thwarted by greedy children for 61 straight years. Talk about a Sisyphean existence. Put him out of his misery already, General Mills.</p>
<p>Image zoom</p>
<p>Those Talking M&amp;Ms</p>
<p>It was always a little disturbing to watch Mr. Peanut shill peanuts for Planters — why would he want to encourage people to eat members of his own species? But at least Mr. Peanut did not perform actual acts of cannibalism, as these voracious and vicious CGI candies do on a regular basis. Sure, they poked fun at their grotesque eating habits in a 2003 ad, but they continue to devour their candy-coated brothers and sisters to this day.</p>

<p>Dig’em Frog</p>
<p>Never mind that Honey Smacks resemble dead bugs (and occasionally carry salmonella), but their amphibian mascot — who wears a T-shirt bearing his own name and a cap turned sideways — is essentially the cereal version of The Simpsons‘ Poochie the Dog.</p>
<p>Image zoom Raymond Boyd/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty</p>
<p>Ronald McDonald</p>
<p>Honestly, Ronald, this is a classic “It’s not you, it’s me” situation. When you were introduced as the fast-food chain’s mascot in 1963, consumers knew a lot less about the damaging health effects of fatty and fried foods — and so they could feed their kids Quarter Pounders and Filet-o-Fish sandwiches guilt-free. Today’s moms and dads can’t claim such ignorance — and your smiling clown face serves as a haunting reminder that every time I give in to my child’s cravings for a Quarter Pounder, I’m hastening his own death.

<h3 id="mr-peanut-facts">&ldquo;Mr. Peanut Facts&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,h_1187,w_2123,x_0,y_58/v1579720920/shape/mentalfloss/80552-gettyimages-625645510.jpg?itok=jy4PJyFS" alt="img">
On January 22, 2020, in a morbid bit of pre-Super Bowl marketing, Planters took to the internet to announce that Mr. Peanut—the dapper little legume who has been peddling Planters peanuts for more than a century—has died at the ripe old age of 104. In order to pay tribute to the literal face of America&rsquo;s peanut industry, we’ve assembled some facts and history about this shell of a man.</p>
<ol>
<li>Mr. Peanut was created by a 14-year-old.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mr. Peanut wasn’t hatched from a cynical ad firm brainstorming session. His adorable visage was the product of a 14-year-old from Suffolk, Virginia named Antonio Gentile. Gentile entered a contest held by the Planters Chocolate and Nut Company in 1916 to crown a new peanut mascot. The aspiring Don Draper sketched out a doodle of a “Mr. P. Nut” strutting with a cane. After getting freshened up by a graphic designer—including donning his trademark spats and monocle—Gentile’s design was picked up and he was awarded $5.</p>
<p>(Postscript: The Gentile family became friendly with the Obici family, owners of the Planters empire, and Gentile’s nephews once suggested that the Obicis helped put him through medical school; he became a surgeon.)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Mr. Peanut has a full name.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Planters, Mr. Peanut is something of an informal moniker. The full name given to him by Gentile was Bartholomew Richard Fitzgerald-Smythe.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Mr. Peanut once weighed more than 300 pounds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although peanuts can be a highly sensible snack, full of healthy fats and protein, they can also be a source of too many calories. Case in point: the 300-pound cast iron Mr. Peanut, a display item made in the 1920s and 1930s. Planters would use the heavyset mascot on top of a fence post at their Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania factory.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Mr. Peanut survived the Great Depression.</li>
</ol>
<p>During the economic downturn of the 1930s, things like “snacks” and “nutrition” suddenly became optional rather than expected. Though many food products struggled to cope with slimmed-down wallets, Planters plastered Mr. Peanut on bags of peanuts that sold for just five cents each. Declaring it a “nickel lunch,” the company was able to use the affordability of peanuts as a selling point.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Mr. Peanut went to war.</li>
</ol>
<p>Getty Images</p>
<p>Specifically, World War II. When the U.S. entered the conflict, Mr. Peanut volunteered for service as a character featured on stamps and propaganda posters.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Mr. Peanut is a monocle enthusiast.</li>
</ol>
<p>Food mascots rarely take sides on hot-button issues, but Mr. Peanut made an exception in 2014 when a fashion movement threatened the return of the monocle. After getting wind of men wearing the single-lens reading accessory, Mr. P issued a press release stating that he took notice of the “hipsters” following in his “stylish footsteps” and implied few could pull it off. The monocle has yet to fully re-emerge.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Mr. Peanut&rsquo;s Nutmobile predates the Wienermobile.</li>
</ol>
<p>Planters</p>
<p>Though the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile usually takes most of the engine-driven PR credit, Planters actually introduced the NUTMobile, a shell-shaped portable advertising car, in 1935—a year prior to the Wienermobile’s introduction. A Planters salesman designed and drove the car, adding a decorative Mr. Peanut passenger behind him. (Mr. Peanut did not operate the vehicle because Mr. Peanut is not real.)</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Mr. Peanut is in the Smithsonian.</li>
</ol>
<p>How influential has Mr. Peanut been to the food industry? In 2013, the Smithsonian admitted his cast-iron incarnation into its National Museum of American History. The statue was exhibited as part of a series on marketing for the institution’s American Enterprise series; Antonio Gentile’s family also donated his original sketches for posterity.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Fans didn&rsquo;t want Mr. Peanut to change.</li>
</ol>
<p>Planters</p>
<p>For the company&rsquo;s 100th anniversary in 2006, Planters held an online vote to see whether peanut aficionados wanted to see Mr. Peanut experiment with a sartorial change: Fans could vote for adding cufflinks, a bow tie, or a pocket watch. In the end, the ballot determined they wanted to keep him just the way he is.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Mr. Peanut has a fan club.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mr. Peanut has appeared in so many different licensed products in an effort to expand his popularity—clocks, peanut butter grinders, and coloring books among them—that a collector was having trouble keeping track of them all. In 1978, Judith Walthall founded Peanut Pals, a Mr. Peanut appreciation club that circulates a newsletter and holds conventions. You can join for $20—practically peanuts.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Mr. Peanut has remained mostly silent.</li>
</ol>
<p>mazmedia via YouTube</p>
<p>Mr. Peanut was already a few decades old when television came into prominence, which afforded him an opportunity to jump off packaging and magazine pages. Despite the new medium, Planters decided they liked him best when he didn’t talk—at all. The mascot was silent all the way up until 2010, when Robert Downey Jr. was commissioned to deliver his first lines. Bill Hader took over voicing duties from Downey in 2013.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Mr. Peanut found a buddy.</li>
</ol>
<p>When Planters unveiled an updated Mr. Peanut for contemporary audiences in 2010, he was sporting a grey flannel suit as well as a new sidekick—Benson, a shorter, single-peanut tagalong. A Planters spokesman clarified to The New York Times that the two are “just friends” and live in separate residences.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>In the 1970s, Mr. Peanut ran for Mayor of Vancouver.</li>
</ol>
<p>Amid a burgeoning alternative art scene in 1970s Vancouver, a performance artist named Vincent Trasov decided it would be interesting to run for mayor of the city while in the guise of Mr. Peanut. Hailing from the “Peanut Party” and meant to be a commentary of the Nixon-era absurdities of politics, he was endorsed by novelist William S. Burroughs and received 2685 ballots—3.4 percent of the vote.

<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/02/03/14/24249062-0-image-a-24_1580741124304.jpg" alt="img">
The Planters nut company introduced their new Baby Nut mascot during a Super Bowl advertisement on Sunday - two weeks after killing off its iconic 104-year-old Mr. Peanut.</p>
<p>The adorable new character was unveiled in a spot during the first half, featuring actors Wesley Snipes and Veep&rsquo;s Matt Walsh.</p>
<p>The stars had appeared in an earlier advertisement that showed Mr. Peanut sacrificing himself to save them after the crash of the NUTmobile.</p>
<p>The brand encouraged fans to share their memories with the hashtag #RIPeanut, and gave away products with commemorative packaging from January 24 to January 27.</p>
<p>But the company was forced to dial back its marketing campaign after the tragic death of basketball legend Kobe Bryant.</p>
<p>Mr. Peanut, the original Planters mascot, is pictured at the Advertising&rsquo;s Most Iconic Mascots seminar in New York in 2017. He was the Planters mascot until he was killed off by the company in an ad the aired in the weeks before the 2020 Super Bowl</p>
<p>Baby Nut emerged was revealed in a 2020 Super Bowl commercial, replacing the original Planters nut company&rsquo;s mascot, Mr. Peanut</p>
<p>The famed Los Angeles Laker died on Jan. 26, along with his daughter Gianna, 13, and seven others when the star&rsquo;s helicopter crashed in California.</p>
<p>Planters, recognizing the devastating loss, said it was still going forward with its campaign to retire Mr. Peanut, and would &lsquo;evaluate next steps through a lens of sensitivity to those impacted by the tragedy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Planters campaign to replace Mr. Peanut was overlapped with the tragic loss of Kobe Bryant, the famed Los Angeles Laker who died in a helicopter crash in California on January 26</p>
<p>Bryant died along with is daughter Gianna, 13, (both pictured) and seven others when the NBA legend&rsquo;s helicopter crashed in Calabasas, California</p>
<p>In the new commercial Snipes and Walsh are joined by other classic mascots, Mr. Clean and the KoolAid Man, along with mourners at a funeral for the deceased Mr. Peanut.</p>
<p>As Snipes eulogizes the former Planters pitchman and the KoolAid man sobs, his tears drop into the soil below.</p>
<p>Vines begin to emerge from the dirt and suddenly the infant legume is born.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that a baby nut?&rsquo; one of the mourners asks, as Walsh bends over to pick him up.</p>
<p>Baby Nut coos like a real child, then makes dolphin sounds for a few seconds before he stops and announces, &lsquo;Just kidding. I&rsquo;m back&rsquo;, revealing he is the reincarnation of Mr. Peanut.</p>

<p>Baby Nut coos like a real child, then makes dolphin sounds for a few seconds before he stops and announces, &lsquo;Just kidding. I&rsquo;m back&rsquo;, revealing he is the reincarnation of Mr. Peanut</p>
<p>Snipes rips up his prepared remarks, as Baby Nut asks, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s my monocle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Baby Nut also sounded not-so-surprisingly familiar to Baby Yoda, the adorable new character from Disney&rsquo;s hit Star Wars TV program, The Mandalorian.</p>
<p>The green little tyke has captivated social media since it was introduced in the new show last year. But some online argued that Baby Nut was following in the footsteps of Groot, the tree-like alien from the Marvel hit film, &lsquo;Guardians of the Galaxy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the movie, Groot similarly sacrifices himself to save the &lsquo;guardians&rsquo;, a team of interstellar misfits who befriend each other.</p>
<p>The end of the film, however, reveals a sapling planted from a twig saved from Groot&rsquo;s demise. The young tree flourishes and becomes Baby Groot.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the movies ending shows Baby Groot dancig to the Jackson Five&rsquo;s &lsquo;One More Chance&rsquo;.</p>
<p>To be clear, as well as funny, Mr. Clean tweeted Mr. Peanut was getting a &lsquo;clean start&rsquo; as Baby Nut.</p>
<p>Baby Nut also sounded not-so-surprisingly familiar to Baby Yoda, the adorable new character from Disney&rsquo;s hit Star Wars TV program, The Mandalorian</p>
<p>The irresistible Baby Yoda has has captivated social media since it was introduced in the new show last year</p>
<p>Atlanta radio station WZPL host Jackson Ammons was quick to point out on social media that Baby Nut was giving Baby Yoda &lsquo;some competition&rsquo;</p>
<p>Geeks of Color tweeted a comparison of Baby Nut against Baby Yoda and Baby Groot, with the words &lsquo;Pick one!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Clean tweeted &lsquo;everyone deserves a clean start&rsquo; as he welcomed Baby Nut</p>
<p>Baby Nut tweeted his thanks to the KoolAid man, who&rsquo;s tears dropped into the soil at Mr. Peanut&rsquo;s grave, and apparently helped reincarnate him into the infant legume</p>
<p>In the original pre-game ad, Mr. Peanut and his human co-stars are on a trip in the NUTmobile when they swerve to avoid hitting an animal, sending the peanut-shaped vehicle over a cliff into a canyon.</p>
<p>The stars and Mr. Peanut all manage to grab onto a branch and are holding on for dear life when it begins to break, unable to support all the weight.</p>
<p>The ad ends after Mr. Peanut tips his hat and lets go, falling into the canyon below and hitting the NUTmobile, which blows up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s with heavy hearts that we confirm Mr. Peanut has passed away at 104 years old,&rsquo; Samantha Hess, Planters Brand Manager at Kraft Heinz, said in a press release at the time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He will be remembered as the legume who always brought people together for nutty adventures and a good time. We encourage fans to tune in to Mr. Peanut&rsquo;s funeral during the third quarter of the Super Bowl to celebrate his life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Walsh also spoke about the loss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Peanut was more than just a friend — he was a hero. His passing has shook me to my core,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best to honor his legacy and be there for my friend s like he was always there for me even until our last wild ride together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll pay my last respects during his funeral on Super Bowl Sunday. I encourage our entire nation to do the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Planters was serious about Mr. Planter&rsquo;s death and encouraged fans to share their memories with the hashtag #RIPeanut. The company&rsquo;s campaign offered memorabilia and giveaways</p>
<p>Planters was founded in 1906, but the Mr. Peanut mascot didn&rsquo;t come around until a decade later, when the company&rsquo;s founder Amedeo Obici held a contest.</p>
<p>The winning idea came from Antonio Gentile, who at the time was just 14 years old and living in Suffolk, Virginia. Gentile drew a peanut with arms, legs, and a face and had him doing different things like somersaulting and riding a toy horse.</p>
<p>The Suffolk News Herald reports that Planters then had a professional artist jazz up the drawings, adding a top hat and monocle.</p>
<p>Mr. Peanut first debut in print on February 23, 1918 edition of the Saturday Evening Post.</p>
<p>Gentile won $5 for his efforts, and Obici went on to pay for him and four of his siblings to go to college.</p>
<p>Mr. Peanut got his first debut in print in the Feb. 23, 1918 edition of the Saturday Evening Post</p>
<p>A poster issued by the United States Deparment of Agriculture to encourage conservation to avoid food shortages during World War II featured Mr Peanut doing his part in the war effort</p>
<p>Mr. Peanut sported different looks over the years as he helped promote Planters</p>
<p>Mr. Peanut as he appeared before his passing</p>
<p>Mr. Peanut&rsquo;s full name, given to him by Gentile, was Bartholomew Richard Fitzgerald-Smythe, MentalFloss reports.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He got his first Times Square billboard in 1937, he first starred in commercials in the 1950s, and his NUTmobile debuted in 1999, according to the brand&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t talk until Robert Downey Jr. was cast to voice him in 2010. The role was taken over by Bill Hader in 2013.</p>
<p>In 2016, he celebrated his 100th birthday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Peanut&rsquo;s continued popularity is a testament to America&rsquo;s love of Planters nuts,&rsquo; Sean Marks, vice president of marketing at Planters, told Parade at the time.

Planters has put a hold on its ad campaign featuring the death of its mascot, Mr Peanut following the death of NBA star Kobe Bryant.</p>
<p>However, the brand says it will continue a planned mock funeral for the animated mascot scheduled for this years Super Bowl.</p>
<p>“We are saddened by this weekend’s news and Planters has paused all campaign activities, including paid media, and will evaluate next steps through a lens of sensitivity to those impacted by this tragedy,” the brand said in a statement.</p>
<p>“At this point, the pause impacts only paid advertising (on channels like Twitter and YouTube) before game day, as well as some other outreach in the immediate wake of this tragedy,” continued the statement. “No change has been made to our plans for Super Bowl Sunday.”</p>
<p>Last week, the Kraft Heinz-owned snack brand released an ad campaign announcing the death of Mr. Peanut, the 104-year-old monocled mascot. The campaign was launched before the accident that killed Bryant and featured a commercial with Wesley Snipes and Matt Walsh, showing Mr. Peanut dying in a car crash.

<h3 id="sunday-1-march-2020---the-monocle-minute">&ldquo;Sunday 1 March 2020 - The Monocle Minute&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.monocle.com/minute/?w=600&amp;resize=aspectfit" alt="img">
I started the week feeling like the busiest CEO of a set of boutique media brands. On the flight from Bangkok to Zürich I was hard at work with pencil and diary scribbling in meetings, plotting holidays, planning events and book tours and lining up management summits. I was so busy! I was off to Seoul to see clients, I was heading to Milan for my friend Kim’s birthday, I was returning for the furniture fair in April and then there was Geneva and Basel for the watch fairs and all kinds of smaller engagements in between. What a difference six days make. While in-flight the clients in Seoul informed my office that they were in lock-down mode and advised against travel. The same day Kim postponed her birthday and moved it to June. Not long after the Milan furniture fair followed Kim’s lead and decided to move its mega event to the end of Q2. Later in the week a major Geneva watch event was scrapped and on Friday the Basel watch fair cancelled for 2020, along with the auto salon in Geneva. Suddenly I had a lot of free time on my hands. Or did I?</p>
<p>As my colleague Andrew wrote in yesterday’s edition, Monocle is being sensible while still recognising that we have a duty to be out in the world covering stories, meeting our commercial partners and keeping our eyes open for opportunities that we know will appeal to you, our curious reader. Despite the cancellations and a lot of erasing in my diary (a small mound of spent rubber on my fold-down tray table), I’m still heading to Helsinki today, will carry on to Tokyo on Monday, make my way westwards again on Saturday – destination Paris via Stockholm. What was the Milan week is now LA, Denver and New York. (Please make a note of it as we’ll be doing signings for our new Japan book.) In a couple of weeks we’re unveiling a new publication we’ve developed in partnership with the French business daily Les Echos and we plan to celebrate it with a cocktail party. And why wouldn’t we? The following week we have our Winter Weekender in St Moritz (a two-day event that many of you have signed up for) and unless the WHO or Swiss authorities advise otherwise, it’s most definitely going ahead because it must.</p>
<p>This irksome virus has hit us at a most curious time. You’ll recall that only a matter of weeks ago we rounded out 2019 with calls for less travel and in certain countries flight shaming was all the rage. Many were taking pride in the fact that they didn’t need to travel for business and they could conduct most of their affairs with the help of a laptop and a smartphone. How different things look when those freedoms are removed and global connections are cut off. There will be many lessons from this virus and a very large post-mortem will be mounted. Beijing will hopefully come good on enforcing its laws banning the consumption of specific wild animals (have you heard the cheers of all those buck-toothed bamboo rats and civet cats?), Tokyo will have time to reflect on why having a “Japanic” isn’t a solution in a time of crisis and that having a little stash of gold is always useful.</p>
<p>Most importantly, this virus reminds us of the power of human connection in a digital world. We might think we’re getting on perfectly fine with our businesses or our families until all of a sudden a trade fair, conference, wedding or reunion is scratched from the diary. It was just last year that too many were questioning the need to go to Milan to look at sofas or Basel to marvel at tourbillons or Venice to wander around national pavilions filled with weird and wonderful art. Yes, we call ourselves CEOs, curators, designers, attorneys and architects but really we’re just traders and tinkers, wanderers and hoarders, hustlers and chroniclers and we love nothing more than the freedom to roam this earth. Oh and speaking of roaming, I still have a few clear weeks in my calendar and I’m happy to lecture on media, read bedtime stories or lead retail safaris in exotic locales. Drop me a note at <a href="mailto:tb@monocle.com">tb@monocle.com</a>.

<h3 id="super-bowl-commercial-killing-off-mr-peanut-mascot-cancelled-after-kobe-bryant-crash">&ldquo;Super Bowl commercial killing off &lsquo;Mr Peanut&rsquo; mascot cancelled after Kobe Bryant crash&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/27/17/screenshot-2020-01-27-at-12.42.29.png" alt="img">
A Super Bowl pre-game commercial in which the Planters brand mascot &lsquo;Mr Peanut&rsquo; is killed off has been put on hold over fears it could be insensitive in the aftermath of Kobe Bryant’s death.</p>
<p>The advert - in which the anthropomorphic peanut shell falls to his death following a crash on a mountainside - had been trailed on YouTube and was to be aired before Sunday’s clash between the San Francisco 49ers, and the Kansas City Chiefs. It was to be followed by a third-quarter commercial showing his funeral.</p>
<p>But the airing of the 30-second spot, which shows the mascot being ejected from his ‘Nutmobile’ alongside actors Wesley Snipes and Matt Walsh, has now been put on hold, according to AdAge, following the helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, which killed Bryant, 41, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, and seven others.</p>
<p>Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines</p>
<p>After being ejected from the vehicle, the commercial shows the trio holding onto a branch before the top hat and monocle-wearing peanut shell plummets to the ground and explodes alongside the vehicle.</p>
<p>It is unclear what the brand it going to do with its paid-for spots - which cost millions of dollars.</p>
