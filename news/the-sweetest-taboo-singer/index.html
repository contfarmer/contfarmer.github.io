<h3 id="how-nigerian-born-british-singer-sade-became-a-global-figure-in-popular-culture-for-decades">&ldquo;How Nigerian-born British singer Sade became a global figure in popular culture for decades&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.face2faceafrica.com/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/sad.jpg" alt="img">
Michael Eli Dokosi is a journalist and a formidable writer with a decade&rsquo;s experience. He is a blogger, voice-over artist and MC. Dokosi is fluid with both spoken and written communication. He is for the African cause and reckons Africa shall regain its rightful place in world affairs soon.</p>
<p>Nigerian-born British singer Helen Folasade Adu known as Sade in entertainment circles was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2002 and promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2018 for her musical exploits as one of the most successful female British artists.</p>
<p>The songwriter, who also dabbled in acting, was born in Ibadan, Nigeria but was raised in Essex, England. She is the child of Nigerian economics professor Adebisi Adu and Anne Hayes, an English nurse. The pair met in London, married in 1955, and moved to Nigeria but when Sade turned four, the couple separated, marking a return to Essex, England with mother and younger brother.</p>
<p>Sade took a fashion course at Central St. Martin’s College of Art and Design in London and afterward worked as a model and menswear designer.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, music, for which she would be globally acclaimed, took on a cursory start when she filled in temporarily as lead singer for Arriva, a funk band that had been put together by her friends. Soon, she began singing with another funk band, Pride, in the early 1980s before breaking away with fellow members Stuart Matthewman, Andrew Hale, and Paul Spencer Denman to form the band that would eventually bear her own name.</p>
<p>The band, with Sade as a lead singer, secured a recording contract with Epic Records in 1983, then released the album Diamond Life a year later, which became one of the best-selling albums of the era, and the best-selling debut ever by a British female vocalist.</p>
<p>In late 1985, the band released Promise, which was also a success, topping the UK Albums Chart and becoming “the band’s first album to debut atop the Billboard 200.” Earning the group the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1986, the song also earned quadruple platinum certification in the U.S. and reached platinum across Europe.</p>
<p>Their next releases, 1988’s Stronger Than Pride and 1992’s Love Deluxe, were also “critically and commercially successful,” however, the band went on a break after the birth of Sade’s child, while reports said, “the singer experienced widespread media coverage during the period for unsubstantiated claims of mental health and addiction issues.”</p>
<p>Sade later appeared in the film Absolute Beginners (1986), having left fans famished for an album for eight years. Eventually, Lovers Rock was released in 2000 earning the group the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. The band then went on another hiatus, not producing music for another ten years until the release of Soldier of Love, which won the group the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.”</p>
<p>The band has since released two new songs; 2018’s “Flower of the Universe” for the soundtrack of Disney’s “A Wrinkle in Time” and “The Big Unknown”, part of the soundtrack for Steve McQueen’s film “Widows”.</p>
<p>Sade, known widely today for her singles Your Love Is King and Smooth Operator, enjoyed critical acclaim and popularity in the 1980s and early ’90s for her blend of soul, funk, jazz, and Afro-Cuban rhythms.</p>
<p>Her hit song “The Sweetest Taboo,” stayed on the American pop charts for six good months. On why it takes so long, sometimes a decade to release an album, Sade, key in the group’s songwriting effort, noted “I only make records when I feel I have something to say. I’m not interested in releasing music just for the sake of selling something. Sade is not a brand”.</p>
<p>As a child, Sade was influenced by American soul music from artists such as Curtis Mayfield, Donny Hathaway, and Bill Withers. While a teenager, she was dazzled by the Jackson 5 at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London where she worked behind the bar at weekends.</p>
<p>Sade has toured extensively noting “If you just do TV or video then you become a tool of the record industry. All you’re doing is selling a product. It’s when I get on stage with the band and we play that I know that people love the music. I can feel it. Sometimes I yearn to be on the road. The feeling overwhelms me.”</p>
<p>The singer fiercely guards her private life stemming from past sour experiences. She rarely gives interviews. For over 30 years, however, Sade has let the music do the talking for her pretty loudly.

<h3 id="aussie-stars-reveal-why-cover-versions-are-special">&ldquo;Aussie stars reveal why cover versions are special&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2020/06/01/v3imagesbin8cb4d3e3b9cf4c324a67d5fb92a6a84a-7lndj5xxggzgegrnfu2_ct1880x930.jpg" alt="img">
The timing was uncanny.</p>
<p>The week before Powderfinger performed their triumphant reunion concert One Night Lonely, a quiet, emotionally rich cover of their beloved B side hit These Days popped up on TV.</p>
<p>Recorded by acclaimed singer and songwriter Thelma Plum, the version was commissioned by CBA to soundtrack a COVID-19-inspired commercial to highlight the spirit of Australians coming together during the pandemic shutdown.</p>
<p>Thelma Plum tackled Powderfinger’s These Days for a CBA campaign. Picture: Supplied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was given the chance to record a song I grew up with, and as a Brissie local, I already know a couple of the Powderfinger guys so of course, I said yes. I even recorded parts of it in Ian&rsquo;s (Haug, Powderfinger guitarist) studio, which made it feel even more natural,&rdquo; Plum said.</p>
<p>COVER CURSE</p>
<p>Covers used to be taboo for the emerging artist.</p>
<p>Many artists in the 50s and 60s kicked off their careers recording versions of songs popular in the American and British charts to take advantage of the fact it could take a couple of months for the original versions could take months to be shipped to Australia.</p>
<p>As more artists took control of writing their own hits in the post-Beatles explosion of original pop music, the cover became a symbol of the sell-out, a record label tool used to launch new talent or revive a stalled career with an already popular song.</p>
<p>But snobbery and suspicion of the record label marketing machine which valued sales and chart positions over expression slowly relaxed in the post-grunge era.</p>
<p>For the original songwriter, a cover version is typically viewed as a compliment.</p>
<p>Bernard Fanning is intrigued by how different These Days is when sung by Kasey or Thelma. Picture: Supplied.</p>
<p>Powderfinger&rsquo;s Bernard Fanning was intrigued by the emotional depth of Plum&rsquo;s version of These Days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something very interesting about a woman singing that song,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kasey (Chambers) did it very early in the piece, not long after it was released, and there&rsquo;s something there that really lends itself to whatever feelings of empathy that are supposed to arise in that song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You kinda picture a different set of circumstances when you hear a woman telling that story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>LIKING THE VERSIONS</p>
<p>5SOS kicked off their recording career with YouTube covers. Picture: Supplied.</p>
<p>Over the past 15 years, YouTube became a discovery tool for talent scouts who searched for aspiring teen singing sensations via their covers uploaded to the platform.</p>
<p>Justin Bieber, Cody Simpson and 5 Seconds of Summer are among dozens of chart-topping pop stars who launched their career via bedroom recordings.</p>
<p>The ambition to &ldquo;make a cover your own&rdquo; is viewed by artists as worthy a pursuit as writing their own hit song.</p>
<p>For more than 15 years, one of the most coveted live performance opportunities on Australian radio has been the weekly Like A Version sessions on Triple J where artists launch a new single and also offer up their unique interpretation of an unexpected song.</p>
<p>Indie pop artist Meg Mac will put her spin on a Billie Eilish song this week. Picture: Supplied.</p>
<p>Indie gospel pop artist Meg Mac has made two visits to the Like A Version studio, performing the Broods song Bridges in 2014, which has had more than 1.3 million views of YouTube, and then Tame Impala&rsquo;s Let It Happen in 2017, with more than two million views.</p>
<p>She will be the third artist to perform for OPPO&rsquo;s Under The Covers, one of the plethora of virtual gigs which have sprung up in the wake of the pandemic shutdown of the concert industry.</p>
<p>Like Vera Blue and The Jungle Giants&rsquo; Sam Hales, Mac did a call out to fans for cover suggestions before deciding to tackle a recent hit, Billie Eilish&rsquo;s When The Party&rsquo;s Over.</p>
<p>The singer is renowned for her idiosyncratic treatment of other artist&rsquo;s songs; her recording and live performance of the Bill Withers&rsquo; song Grandma&rsquo;s Hands became hugely popular among Australia&rsquo;s alternative music fans with thousands mistakenly thinking it was her own composition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People would send me videos of other people covering Grandma&rsquo;s Hands saying &lsquo;This famous person is singing your song,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love doing covers. It&rsquo;s kind of going back to why you do music in the first place. You don&rsquo;t start writing songs, you start singing other people&rsquo;s songs and slowly, eventually you try writing your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When approaching a song to cover, Mac often finds herself gravitating to a background part in the arrangement to highlight rather than the obvious vocal melody or lyrics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I did Tame Impala&rsquo;s Let It Happen, there is a vocoder thing in the outro that happens at the end of a seven-minute song which became my favourite part of the song which I wanted to put in the beginning,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There really are no rules, you can take any song and just do it for fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SWEETEST TABOO</p>
<p>Katie Noonan has just released The Sweetest Taboo, a jazz tribute album of her favourite 80s artists including Whitney Houston, Icehouse and Crowded House.</p>
<p>Katie Noonan has recorded her fave 80s tracks for Sweetest Taboo record. Picture: Lyndon Mechielsen/The Australian</p>
<p>Her version of Houston&rsquo;s I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me) reveals all the heartwrenching emotion at the centre of the song, often missed when you are in the throes of letting loose on the dancefloor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a singer, I feel a responsibility to study the lyrics,&rdquo; Noonan said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always loved that song - Whitney was my first absolute queen - and when I was learning it, I discovered it&rsquo;s such a sad song about loneliness and isolation. It couldn&rsquo;t be more fitting for these times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While covering her queen was a daunting task, Noonan admits she suffered more nerves tackling the songs of Australian artists she has respected and crossed paths with during her illustrious career.</p>
<p>She was chuffed when Icehouse&rsquo;s Iva Davies sent a note about her cover of his 1987 smash Electric Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a pure joy to be able to listen to a singer with such a rare gift, such control and subtlety, and such complete command of her voice,&rdquo; Davies wrote about the cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katie&rsquo;s interpretations of these songs are so imaginative and original that they reveal these songs as never before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BIGGER THAN THE ORIGINAL</p>
<p>Many covers have become bigger hits than their original versions and introduced a seminal artist to new generations such as the k.d. lang and Jeff Buckley versions of Leonard Cohen&rsquo;s masterpiece Hallelujah.</p>
<p>British band the Zutons enjoyed a top hit with their 2006 single Valerie but the song became inextricably linked to the late British singer Amy Winehouse when hitmaker Mark Ronson rearranged it for her.</p>
<p>Amy Winehouse made The Zutons’ Valerie her own with some help from Mark Ronson. Picture: Supplied.</p>
<p>Eighties pop stars Bananarama hit the top of the charts worldwide in 1986 thanks to their recording of Venus, originally released by Dutch rock band Shocking Blue in the late 60s.</p>
<p>Trent Reznor was effusive in his praise of the haunting interpretation of the Nine Inch Nails song Hurt, insisting the song would forever belong to the country music legend.</p>
<p>And one of the popular party songs of all time, Soft Cell&rsquo;s Tainted Love was in fact a cover of American soul queen Gloria Jones in the mid 1960s.</p>
<p>k.d. lang had people in tears with her Hallelujah at the Fire Fight concert in February. Picture: AAP Image/Joel Carrett.</p>
<p>But perhaps one of the most iconic covers to remain culturally relevant in Australia for six decades is Wild One - also known as Real Wild Child.</p>
<p>The original by Johnny O&rsquo;Keefe released in 1958 is widely acknowledged as our first homegrown rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll hit while the Iggy Pop version continues as the theme to ABC video show Rage.</p>

<p><img src="https://cloudimages.broadwayworld.com/columnpiccloud/1250-bf9ac679241f3e1012064e1e8a8ab41b.jpg" alt="img">
Internationally acclaimed musicians Suzie Quatro, Katie Noonan, Nicole Car and Matthew Lee Robinson will select four singers to be the winners of the ASC@Home International Singing Competition after entries closed last week.</p>
<p>These top industry professionals will select the winners in the categories of Opera and Classical, Musical Theatre, Jazz, and Contemporary. The competition has received a large number of international entries in Australia, the US, the UK, Malaysia, Czech Republic, China, Canada and Italy amongst others.</p>
<p>The judging panel have all donated their time to ASC@Home. They will view all entries online, out of which they will select a grand prize winner in their category to receive $1000USD. The Audience Choice Prize of $500USD will be awarded to the singer that receives the highest number of online votes.</p>
<p>Legendary American Rock singer-songwriter Suzi Quatro will judge the Contemporary category. Suzi has donated her time to a number of Covid-19 industry support programs like ASC@Home including the Save Our Venue campaign. She is also involved in the Lifeline Voices Unite campaign.</p>
<p>Internationally acclaimed Operatic Soprano Nicole Car, who is also working with the ASC@Home administrator, the Music &amp; Opera Singers Trust (MOST) in the development of the Freelance Artists Relief Fund (FARA), will adjudicate the ASC@Home Opera and Classical category.

<h3 id="adomako-aman-donchristian-tribute-sades-sweetest-taboo">&ldquo;Adomako Aman, DonChristian Tribute Sade&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sweetest Taboo&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMjA4NDAxMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMDI4OTgxMH0.b9qXXnROgLMg-E_Rirtc60cOGFjbPIK6hcEoHNMrq4k/img.jpg?width=1200&amp;coordinates=0%2C104%2C0%2C1681&amp;height=600" alt="img">
There have been murmurs of the enigmatic Sade Adu possibly releasing her first album with her eponymous band since 2010&rsquo;s Soldier of Love. If it comes next year, it continues the singer&rsquo;s trend of 10-year gaps between full-length releases (Lover&rsquo;s Rock arrived in 2000.)</p>
<p>Whether new music comes in 2020 or not, in the decade since her last body of work, Sade&rsquo;s legacy of creating timeless love songs has only grown in the minds of fans old and new, reaching across the generational divide. Fittingly, numerous rising artists, from Amber Mark to Tinashe, count Sade as a key influence for their genre-bending work.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Sade&rsquo;s music has connected with queer fanbases worldwide, too. Artist/filmmaker Adomako Aman knows this so well, he directed a video paying tribute to one of the singer&rsquo;s sexiest and most beloved classics, &ldquo;The Sweetest Taboo,&rdquo; premiering today on PAPER. The song&rsquo;s universal, if slightly cryptic lyrics have received countless fan interpretations since its 1985 release, from describing a drug high to a clandestine lesbian love affair.</p>

<p>Embodying these ideas, Aman casts himself in his &ldquo;Sweetest Taboo&rdquo; clip as Sade. As she played a lovelorn lounge singer in the original video, so does Aman. Performance shots and beach scenes are filled with bountiful natural light and executed effortlessly — a loyal homage to the source material that honors Sade&rsquo;s enduring appeal. Rapper/artist DonChristian plays Aman&rsquo;s love interest in the video; the pair canoodle in Speedos on the beach, showcasing the decadent beauty of queer Black love. We love to see it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sade means so much to so many of us, I think, for her timelessness and grace — the effortlessness with which she exudes style, both musically and in dress,&rdquo; DonChristian says. &ldquo;She is a source reference.&rdquo;
