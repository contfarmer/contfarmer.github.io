<p>LINE Of Duty is one of the most popular shows on the BBC and it has been confirmed for a sixth series.</p>
<p>Viewers are desperate to find out what goes down when series six hits our screens - but the wait might be longer than expected due to lockdown.</p>

<p>When is Line of Duty season six on TV?</p>
<p>Line Of Duty fans are on the edge of their seat waiting for the next series of the hit show, which is due to arrive in 2021.</p>
<p>Filming for series six began in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in February 2020, as Martin Compston confirmed on his Instagram page.</p>
<p>Vicky McClure, Compston and Adrian Dunbar were pictured reunited ahead of series six.</p>
<p>However, the coronavirus pandemic halted filming when the UK went into lockdown in March 2020.</p>
<p>There was talk that the filming may be completely overhauled, but it was confirmed that the cast returned to Belfast to continue filming in October 2020.</p>
<p>To the delight of fans, Vicky McClure and Martin Compston have been posting footage of themselves goofing around on set.</p>
<p>Creator Jed Mercurio revealed plans for season six filming to finish “before Christmas” in order to guarantee a 2021 release.</p>
<p>Mercurio spoke more about the fate of the series during a Royal Television Society talk.</p>

<p>Who is in the cast of Line Of Duty season six?</p>
<p>So far the big three of DI Kate Fleming, Ted Hastings and Steve Arnott have been confirmed to return for series six.</p>
<p>Kelly MacDonald is also joining the cast for the new series.</p>
<p>She will play Detective Chief Inspector Joanne Davidson, the senior investigating officer of an unsolved murder, who raises suspicions at AC-12.</p>

<p>What can we expect from season six?</p>
<p>WARNING: Contains spoilers from season five of Line Of Duty</p>
<p>It has been confirmed that the three main characters will certainly be returning in season six, as they have been spotted on set already.</p>
<p>We can also expect the series to be comprised of six one-hour episodes on BBC One.</p>
<p>Season five left us reeling as it was revealed there were FOUR top corrupt coppers - Gill Biggeloe, ACC Hilton and DI &ldquo;Dot&rdquo; Cottan, with the final member remaining at large.</p>
<p>AC-12 chief Ted Hastings was exonerated - although given a warning - at the end of season five, as it was revealed that he wasn&rsquo;t the mysterious H.</p>
<p>But series creator Jed Mercurio doesn&rsquo;t seem to rule out the possibility of Ted being the final &ldquo;dot&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ted’s behaviour was often suspicious, such as when he misspelled the word definitely as “definately”, exactly the same as the leader of the organised crime group.</p>
<p>Mercurio argues that mimicking previous messages is a “plausible” defence, although some still think it points to his guilt.</p>
<p>So perhaps season six will delve deeper into Ted&rsquo;s shenanigans especially as there&rsquo;s no way to prove he was viewing pornography on his deleted computer and not communicating with the OCG.</p>
<p>We could also expect to see the return of DCS Patricia ­Carmichael from AC-3.</p>
<p>She has vowed to take Hastings down, but could she be bent as well as one of her colleagues, Martina Tranter, who tried to kill Biggeloe?</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s Ryan Pilkington.</p>
<p>He first appeared in the show in the first series - so it&rsquo;s probably a good idea to reacquaint yourself with his actions there.</p>
<p>At the end of series five the OCG thug, makes it into the police force, so potentially another bent copper on the beat.</p>

<p>How did Line Of Duty season five end?</p>
<p>WARNING: Contains spoilers from season five of Line Of Duty</p>
<p>Despite top bods trying to pin it on Superintendent Ted Hastings, a shock twist revealed H is not one person, but a group of four bent people working within the police force.</p>
<p>Police lawyer Gill Biggeloe was exposed as the bent copper who had been working alongside Cottan and Hilton who were brought down previously.</p>
<p>But the fourth member is still unknown.</p>
<p>The main focus of the episode sees an unkempt Ted being questioned by his nemesis, DCS Patricia Carmichael, played by Anna Maxwell Martin.</p>
<p>With 30 minutes left, DS Steve Arnott and DC Kate Fleming crack the case and discover that they have been looking for several people all along.</p>
<p>As the truth comes out about Gill, she attempts to contact the OCG on her burner phone but no one comes to her rescue and she is arrested.</p>
<p>4 Steven and Kate will grace our screens again on Line of Duty Credit: BBC</p>
<p>But towards the very end of the episode, it’s evidently clear that the fourth bent copper is still walking free as PC Tranter, who had been working with Carmichael, takes Gill to the loo.</p>
<p>The officer whips out a knife and attempts to kill Gill - but the blade goes through her hand instead.</p>
<p>Arnott storms into the bathroom and shoots Tranter, who had been given the order to silence Gill following her arrest.</p>
<p>One member of the OCG, Lisa, is seen getting a new ID and working with schools.</p>
<p>Her former OCG pal Ryan becomes a student police officer.</p>
<p>Operation Pear Tree is closed and both Fleming and Arnott receive a commendation for their role in events.</p>
<p>Retired DCI Mark Moffatt is found guilty of bribery after Gill&rsquo;s confession - and she is given a new ID.</p>
<p>LATEST ON LINE OF DUTY ACHOO-TY CALLS Gogglebox fans giggles as Line Of Duty&rsquo;s Adrian Dunbar constantly sneezes end of the line Line of Duty creator admits he &lsquo;already knows how the show will end&rsquo; DUTY CALLS Line of Duty&rsquo;s Vicky McClure and Adrian Dunbar battle the cold on set in Belfast GOGGLECOPS Line of Duty&rsquo;s Adrian Dunbar, Martin Compston &amp; Vicky McClure join Gogglebox FINAL DUTIES Line of Duty&rsquo;s Adrian Dunbar hints series 6 will be the last</p>
<p>Moffat claims the money found in Hastings room is only half the amount, but then we see Hastings approaching bent copper John Corbett&rsquo;s widow with an envelope that probably contains the outstanding £50,000.</p>
<p>John had previously worked undercover with the OCG, but had lost contact with his handlers.</p>
<p>A formal misconduct hearing into unauthorised undercover operations finds Superintendent Hastings guilty of discreditable conduct.</p>
<p>Following a final written warning, Hastings continues to command AC-12.

When will Line of Duty season 6 finally be on our screens? (Picture: BBC)</p>
<p>Line of Duty stars Adrian Dunbar, Vicky McClure and Martin Compston have given us a much-needed dose of AC-12 as they reunited for a stint on Celebrity Gogglebox.</p>
<p>The trio joined a string of other famous faces – including Mo Gilligan, John Bishop, David Mitchell and Victoria Coren – for a star-studded edition of the Channel 4 series, to raise money for Stand Up To Cancer.</p>
<p>A first-look at the stars in action showed Vicky screaming in terror at a clip from a horror film.</p>
<p>And the snippet gave us all the feels.</p>
<p>But when will we see Ted Hastings, Kate Fleming and Steve Arnott back fighting corruption on the BBC drama?</p>

<p>When is Line of Duty season 6 starting?</p>
<p>The Line of Duty stars returned to filming earlier this year (Picture: BBC)</p>
<p>The gang were last on our screens in 2019, as they battled to clear Hastings’ name in the search for the elusive H.</p>
<p>The sixth season started filming earlier this year before production was halted due to lockdown, meaning that the original schedule has definitely been delayed.</p>
<p>The show will hopefully return to our screens in 2021 – if all goes to plan.</p>
<p>BBC’s official position is that the series ‘is now due to air on BBC One next year’.</p>
<p>Speaking about a possible air date, showrunner Jed Mercurio said: ‘We’d love to be on air next year, so we really have to make sure we complete our filming before Christmas.’</p>
<p>‘We know Line of Duty fans are desperate for series 6 and we hope we can get it on air as soon as possible,’ he added in a message to viewers.</p>
<p>‘Thanks so much for your patience in these difficult times.’</p>
<p>Why was season 6 delayed?</p>
<p>Production on the new season originally started earlier this year, but bosses had to pause things just weeks into shooting, due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>During an appearance on BBC Breakfast, Vicky previously revealed: ‘We were filming, we were about six weeks into the shoot of 16 weeks, so we’ve got a long way to go yet.’</p>
<p>Martin, who plays DS Steve Arnott, was thrilled to get back to AC-12, and celebrated when he was able to eventually return to set.</p>
<p>‘It’s been a long few months and it will be a different way of working from when we stopped, but I’m delighted to be back on the case with the Line of Duty team,’ he enthused.</p>
<p>While Vicky added: ‘Been sitting on these incredible scripts for some time now, so I’m really looking forward to getting back to it and seeing the Line of Duty family.’</p>
<p>Who is in the Line of Duty cast?</p>

<p>Adrian (Ted Hastings) leads up a star-studded cast, alongside colleagues Vicky (Kate Fleming) and Martin (Steve Arnott), with all three returning to filming.</p>
<p>They will be joined by Kelly Macdonald, with the Trainspotting actress playing Detective Chief Inspector Joanne Davidson, the senior investigating officer of an unsolved murder.</p>
<p>‘We’re honoured that Kelly Macdonald will join Martin, Vicky and Adrian in series six of Line of Duty,’ Jed announced.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>‘DCI Joanne Davidson will prove the most enigmatic adversary AC-12 have ever faced.’</p>
<p>Little else is known about Kelly’s character, except that her unconventional conduct ‘raises suspicions’ at AC-12.</p>
<p>Shalom Brune-Franklin, Andi Osho, Prasanna Puwanarajah and Perry Fitzpatrick will also be part of the cast.</p>
<p>Line of Duty will return to BBC One soon.</p>

<p>The writer, 54, took to Twitter to share a collection of photos of DS Steve Arnott, Ted Hastings, played by Adrian Dunbar, and DI Kate Fleming, as they playfully posed on set.</p>

<p>Elsewhere other fans came up with another bizarre theory as they noted Ted Hastings was stood in front of a piece of graffiti which had the letter H.</p>

LINE of Duty creator Jed Mercurio has broken his silence on BBC axe rumours - admitting he &lsquo;already knows how the show will end&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The hit crime drama is currently filming its sixth season, and addressing speculation over whether the show would move to another network or streaming service if it was axed by the BBC, Jed said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if [it&rsquo;d go to Netflix] if it was dropped.</p>
<p>4 Line of Duty&rsquo;s boss has revealed he knows how the show will end Credit: BBC</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think in the UK there&rsquo;s not really much of a tradition of going from channel to channel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added during a Royal Television Society&rsquo;s &lsquo;In Conversation With&rsquo; discussion:&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite rare for something to be dropped and then picked up by another channel. I think the chances are quite slim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Line of Duty got dropped by the BBC, I don&rsquo;t think it would automatically get picked up by anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While there are no plans for the series to be brought to an end by the BBC any time soon, Jed does know how he will wrap everything up when the time does come.</p>

<p>He said: &ldquo;Yes, I do know how it will end. As an overview yes, but in terms of detail no.</p>
<p>“We would figure out the number of episodes based on the detail. I am in this very fortunate position where I can do other things and then come back to &lsquo;Line Of Duty&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jed, who also wrote the hit series Bodyguard, continued: “The fact is I’m not doing &lsquo;LOD&rsquo; year in, year out and they allow me to explore other ideas. If you have success in a particular genre you will be considered more marketable in that genre.</p>
<p>“Should you play to your strengths or is it you would enjoy doing something fresh?”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Adrian Dunbar – who plays Superintendent Ted Hastings on the show – has suggested the sixth series could be the last.</p>
<p>He told the Belfast Telegraph newspaper: &ldquo;This series we are trying to bring the current storylines to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might go again for a seventh series. I don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s in the lap of the gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>GRAHAM Norton gets paid at least £2million to talk to people on his Radio 2 and BBC1 shows – so it’s a surprise to hear when his guests speak he glazes over “all the time”.</p>
<p>He even admitted that when he does listen to the superstars on his sofa, he’s often bored.</p>

<p>Graham said: “You zone back in and they’re still talking and you think: ‘I wonder if I’ve missed anything?’ But, you probably haven’t.</p>
<p>“That’s the trick. It’s just yakkety yak. If I’m on it, I’m listening. I’m still bored.”</p>
<p>He also admitted that during an interview with Downton Abbey star Elizabeth McGovern he got her name wrong, calling her Elizabeth Montgomery – the star of vintage US sitcom Bewitched who died 25 years ago.</p>
<p>He said: “The first time I said her name, a funny look went across her face, and bless her, this makes me like her so much, she didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“She let me call her the wrong name.”</p>
