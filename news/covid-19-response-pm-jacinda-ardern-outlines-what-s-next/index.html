<p>Subject: Protect democracy, vote for Biden.</p>
<p>I know you don&rsquo;t want to hear this from me. And I guarantee I don&rsquo;t want to say it. But we are facing an unprecedented attack on the foundations of democracy itself. If you are a US citizen, anything less than a vote for Biden is a vote against democracy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m saying a vote for Trump, a vote for a third-party candidate, or simply not voting at all &ndash; they&rsquo;re all the same, and they all mean:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I care more about my favorite issue than democracy. I believe Trump winning is more important than democracy. I am comfortable standing aside and allowing democracy to be methodically dismantled, in plain sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the polls are accurate, there&rsquo;s a roughly 50% chance that you agree Trump needs to go. You know what to do: show up on November 3rd and vote for Biden. Or even better, don&rsquo;t wait until then: vote today. Go to Vote.org if you need help figuring out how.</p>
<p>The rest of this email is intended to address the concerns of those who disagree, and I&rsquo;ll try to take the most likely questions in turn:</p>
<p>Q: Why do you care so much about democracy?</p>
<p>Democracy is core to our business success, in a variety of ways. Internally, we are a famously &ldquo;flat&rdquo; organization &ndash; nobody reports to anyone else, and advancement is the result of meeting well defined criteria as judged by the vote of those who have already advanced. How we compensate each other is left up to a team vote as well. Even our external business model depends on individual employees &ldquo;electing&rdquo; to adopt Expensify as individuals, and then &ldquo;campaigning&rdquo; internally to get it adopted companywide. At every layer, democracy is our core competitive advantage &ndash; both as a company, and as a nation. But that advantage is only as strong as the clarity of our rules and the fairness of their application. Any attempt to disrupt the rules or apply them unfairly is a direct threat to the strength of our company, and the strength of our nation.</p>
<p>Q: What gives you the right to tell me what to do?</p>
<p>The first amendment. To be clear, you don&rsquo;t need to listen. But the first amendment exists to encourage people like you and me to find some way to talk about the issues that matter, set aside our differences, and find a common ground on which to collectively govern 331 million citizens. Yes democratic self-rule can be inconvenient. But a burden of democracy is that this is literally our job, so I&rsquo;m asking all of us to take it seriously.</p>
<p>Q: But you&rsquo;re a company, shouldn&rsquo;t you remain neutral?</p>
<p>Expensify depends on a functioning society and economy; not many expense reports get filed during a civil war. As CEO of this business, it&rsquo;s my job to plot a course through any storm &ndash; and all evidence suggests that another 4 (or as Trump has hinted &ndash; 8, or more?) years of Trump leadership will damage our democracy to such an extent, I&rsquo;m obligated on behalf of shareholders to take any action I can to avoid it. I am confident our democracy (and Expensify) can survive a Biden presidency. I can&rsquo;t say the same about Trump. It&rsquo;s truly as simple as that.</p>
<p>Q: Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;re… exaggerating a bit?</p>
<p>I truly wish I was. I wouldn&rsquo;t be sending this email if this election were just about &ldquo;normal issues&rdquo; &ndash; taxes, legislative priorities, healthcare, etc. But it isn&rsquo;t. This election is a referendum on what limits, if any, we place on our elected leaders to govern us in a fair and representative way. This election will decide if widespread voter suppression is an acceptable governing tactic.</p>
<p>Q: Doesn&rsquo;t everyone suppress votes?</p>
<p>Not like Trump. This is the most heavily litigated election in history, with over 300 lawsuits rushing through the courts before election day. And in every case, Biden is pushing to enable voters while Trump is pushing to suppress them. The trend couldn&rsquo;t be more clear: Biden wants democracy, Trump does not. A vote for Trump is to endorse voter suppression, it really is very basic. This isn&rsquo;t about party politics: if Biden were advocating for half of the voter suppression that Trump is actively doing, then I&rsquo;d be fighting against Biden, too. This is bigger than politics as usual: this is about the very foundation of our nation.</p>
<p>Q: Isn&rsquo;t Trump just trying to prevent voter fraud?</p>
<p>Voter fraud is virtually nonexistent, as overwhelmingly shown by data showcased by the White House itself. That data comes from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank counting every single known case of voter fraud since 1948, which adds up to only 1,290 distinct votes over 78 years. In 2016 alone there were 138 million votes. There is just no credible argument that voter fraud is significant, even based on Trump&rsquo;s own data.</p>
<p>Q: Isn&rsquo;t Biden just using more widespread voting to get elected?</p>
<p>Absolutely. This is the heart of the issue. Biden believes that enabling more people to vote will help him win. Biden wins by promoting democracy; Trump wins by suppressing it. A vote for Biden is a vote for democracy.</p>
<p>Q: So what if Trump gets elected by voter suppression, all&rsquo;s fair right?</p>
<p>Well that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to decide, on November 3rd. Do you want your elected official to win based on the merits of their ideas? Or based on the ruthlessness of their voter suppression? And if you&rsquo;re ok with &ldquo;just a little suppression&rdquo; &ndash; where do you draw the line?</p>
<p>Q: Why send me this when the polls say Biden is going to win?</p>
<p>The polls said Trump was going to lose last time, and he didn&rsquo;t. But even if the polls can be trusted, that might still not be enough. Trump has stated repeatedly he will only honor an election that he personally feels is fair. So much depending on his personal judgement is worrying, because he has rejected the overwhelming expert consensus that voter fraud has been negligible historically, and has also said he believes it would be impossible to lose a fair election. Accordingly, the only way to ensure a peaceful transition of power is to ensure this election is an overwhelming, undeniable landslide in favor of Biden. Any excuse to question the election is an opportunity for Trump to refuse to leave the White House, plunging this country into a Constitutional crisis bordering on civil war. No matter how slight that risk might be, the consequences of it happening would be so catastrophic to society and the economy, we need to do all we can to prevent it.</p>
<p>So one final plea. As a fellow citizen, I fully support and respect your Constitutional right to disagree &ndash; and as an avid supporter of democracy, I value that disagreement. Constructive, well-informed debate (hopefully using the most accurate, least biased news source available) is what makes this nation so exceptional.</p>
<p>But the Constitution is only as strong as the respect we give it. I&rsquo;m asking you to cherish it close to your heart, and demand that those you elect do the same.</p>
<p>-david</p>
<p>Founder and CEO of Expensify</p>
<p>PS: Agree or disagree? Reply to this email to share your thoughts with Concierge, or hit me up on Twitter @dbarrett to discuss!</p>
<p>PPS: Want to do even more? Support the National Popular Vote to make every vote count equally toward the presidential election, even if you aren&rsquo;t in one of the 12 states deciding this election.</p>
<p>PPPS: Are you annoyed that you received this as a non-US citizen? If you&rsquo;re lucky enough to live in a democracy, then I&rsquo;d encourage you to protect it and be willing to do uncomfortable things &ndash; like emailing millions of customers &ndash; to defend it.

<p><img src="https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/78824549/no-evidence-for-trump-claim-that-joe-biden-earned-money-in-china-according-to-the-wall-street-journal-contradicting-its-editorial-section.jpg?imgsize=149496" alt="img">
The Wall Street Journal found no evidence to support President Trump&rsquo;s claim that Joe Biden did business in China.</p>
<p>The Journal&rsquo;s reporters reviewed corporate records, emails, and text messages.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s claim, during Thursday&rsquo;s debate, came the same week it was revealed he himself had a secret bank account in China.</p>
<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden had no role in a proposed investment venture in China, according to corporate records, emails, and text messages reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>At Thursday night&rsquo;s debate, President Donald Trump repeatedly asserted that Biden was involved in his son Hunter&rsquo;s business dealings, specifically accusing him of taking money from China — a charge he made the same week it was revealed he himself had secretly maintained a bank account in the country.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>But there is no evidence to support the president&rsquo;s accusation that the former vice president was ever involved in his son&rsquo;s business dealings, in China or elsewhere.Indeed, text messages and emails provided by the original source for the claim, Anthony Bobulinksi, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t show either Hunter Biden or James Biden [the vice president&rsquo;s younger brother] discussing a role for Joe Biden in the venture,&rdquo; The Journal reported Thursday night.</p>
<p>Prior to Thursday&rsquo;s debate, Bobulinksi held a press conference where he alleged that Joe Biden took part in a 2017 meeting, when he was a private citizen, to discuss a proposed investment opportunity in China. He cited an email from another investor, James Gillar, referring to a potential equity share for a &ldquo;big guy,&rdquo; claiming that was a reference to Biden.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am unaware of any involvement at any time of the former vice president,&rdquo; Gillar, a former business partner of Hunter, told The Journal. Of the proposed investment opportunity in China, he added: &ldquo;The activity in question never delivered any project revenue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a statement issued Wednesday night to the New York Post, a right-wing tabloid, Bobulinski claimed the proposed investment was between him &ldquo;and the Biden family,&rdquo; an assertion that The Wall Street Journal&rsquo;s conservative editorial page took as evidence that &ldquo;Joe Biden was accepting influence payments, including from Chinese entities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>But corporate records reviewed by journalists at the paper — owned by the same parent company as the Post and Fox News — provided no evidence for that.A spokesperson for Joe Biden told The Journal the former vice president &ldquo;has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="expensify-ceo-shares-high-level-keys-for-keeping-costs-low-and-managing-expenses--techcrunch">&ldquo;Expensify CEO shares high-level keys for keeping costs low and managing expenses – TechCrunch&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1135562871.jpg?w=600" alt="img">
As we find ourselves tumbling toward a global financial crisis, every business is taking a second and third look at expenses going out the door to make sure they really, truly need them. Based on more than a decade of experience processing billions of dollars in expense reports for the top startups in Silicon Valley, here are the high-level keys to keeping costs low and managing expenses: hire people you trust, keep policies light and flexible, and invest in experiences that bring your team together. On the tactical side, get your travel policies in order (you know, when travel is a thing again), give everyone a smart corporate card and be honest about what really matters. These should all start way before the point of scouring spreadsheets for savings — and as a startup, you have a chance to get it right out of the gates. Invest now so you don’t have to cut later.</p>
<p>Quick background on me: I started programming when I was six and spent the early days of my tech career building 3D graphics engines for video games. Eventually, I ended up working at Red Swoosh, a startup that Akamai bought just in time for the world to descend into the 2008 recession. Since then, I’ve been focused on relieving the world’s frustrations one expense report at a time. I’ve come to see how more than a million companies handle billions of dollars in expenses, and I’m here to give you some of the best expense-management tips I’ve picked up along the way.</p>
<p>Hire people you trust</p>
<p>Rule zero of expense management is to hire people you trust. If you trust your team, you don’t need to micromanage expenses. If you don’t trust your team, no amount of micromanaging expenses will matter. Expense tools aren’t lie detectors or mind readers; they exist primarily to catch mistakes, not criminals.

<h3 id="applause-honors-companies-for-stellar-digital">&ldquo;Applause Honors Companies for Stellar Digital…&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.applause.com/images/blog-heroes/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Award-blog-post.jpg?mtime=1602776669" alt="img">
Expensify, Just Eat, Microsoft, Paysafe, PBS and SimpliSafe exemplify dedication to their customers</p>
<p>Applause is excited to present the Applause Customer Excellence (ACE) Awards to companies that truly go above and beyond in delivering stellar digital experiences and services for their customers, and in taking innovative approaches to software development.</p>
<p>As the world leader in digital quality and remote testing, Applause provides leading brands with the authentic, real-world testing results they can’t get anywhere else &ndash; derived from curated teams sourced to match the specific testing needs and unique demographics of each company’s customers.</p>
<p>Applause is proud to honor six companies as this quarter’s ACE Award winners: Expensify, Just Eat, Microsoft, Paysafe, PBS and SimpliSafe. Award winners were nominated by our account management teams, and finalists chosen by a panel of software development and testing experts.</p>
<p>Additional ACE categories and winners will be announced quarterly, and each award winn er will be eligible for the top Digital Quality Excellence Award, as voted on by our community of customers and testers, as well as industry thought leaders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ACE Awards help us recognize the amazing companies we support, and showcase their ongoing commitment to delivering true digital quality to their customers,” said Doron Reuveni, CEO and founder of Applause. “With digital properties now critical to daily life, it’s especially gratifying this year to celebrate great software development work. The winners are leaders in their respective fields, who have chosen to leverage real-world testing as part of their process of providing exceptional digital experiences for their customers.”</p>
<p>ACE Winners, Q3 2020</p>
<p>Excellence in Digital Workforce Experiences: Expensify</p>
<p>Flawless mobile experiences are critical to every brand’s success in today’s digital world. That is certainly the case for Expensify, as itsmobile app is the go-to place for end users and accounts for roughly 80% of its traffic.</p>
<p>Given the high-profile nature of its apps, it comes as no surprise that Expensify is fully committed to making its digital experiences as user friendly, intuitive and functionally sound as possible, which is why Expensify won the ACE Award for Excellence in Digital Workforce Experiences.</p>
<p>For Tim Golen, director at Expensify, building award-winning digital experiences starts with saving customers time.</p>
<p>“One of the core values at Expensify is that time is valuable. That’s why we say that we’re successful when a customer doesn’t have to use the product at all,” said Golen. “The more the product can automatically do for the customer, the less they have to use the app. If the customer needs to scan a receipt, for example, they simply click “Scan” and then close the app. The receipt will automatically be submitted and reimbursed. In ways like this, we’re giving customers their time back by making the digital experience easy, automatic and straightforward.”</p>
<p>Excellence in Mobile Delivery Experiences: Just Eat</p>
<p>Food delivery services have only become more important as consumer demand increases amid the global pandemic. While it’s become an essential service, it has also become an increasingly competitive market, with each brand looking to separate itself from the rest of the pack. Just Eat has been able to do just that by focusing on its mobile app to provide a secure, seamless and personalized experience for all users.</p>
<p>“We know that each individual customer has their own unique journey when using Just Eat, which is why we’re committed to building a more personal experience,” said Daniel Broad, Senior Technology Manager of Consumer Apps at Just Eat. “When customers open the app, it’s personalized to their requirements – from restaurants they like to personalized orders and recommendations. The navigation also makes the experience simple, so that it’s easy to order what you want, when you want.”</p>
<p>Consistency is key for Just Eat; the company has released software updates every two weeks to 13 countries without fail for the past two years. This regimented release cadence, along with a stringent testing practice, has helped Just Eat get high-quality experiences in the hands of customers quickly – an important practice to keep up with the pace of change today.</p>
<p>Just Eat’s work and attention to detail has continued to pay off as the brand was recognized with the ACE Award for Excellence in Mobile Delivery Experiences.</p>
<p>Excellence in Inclusive Design: Microsoft</p>
<p>As an organization, Microsoft has long been committed to creating technology that can empower everyone to achieve more, strengthen education opportunities, and make workplaces more inviting and inclusive for people with disabilities. A focus on accessibility and inclusive usability is essential to delivering on Microsoft’s mission to “empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.”</p>
<p>The Microsoft Cloud &amp; AI Team embodies that commitment. The Cloud &amp; AI team works every day to ensure strong user experiences for people with disabilities, across a large portfolio of enterprise websites and applications. The team embeds accessibility into the full software development lifecycle, with a focus to shift-left and identify opportunities to add an inclusive lens as early as possible.</p>
<p>While achieving conformance with standards such as WCAG are critical, Microsoft’s Cloud &amp; AI Team goes a step beyond. The team understands that user experience for everyone is critical, and can help reduce unemployment for people with disabilities. With responsibility for business critical applications, the Microsoft Cloud &amp; AI team can open up career opportunities for individuals with disabilities by ensuring these powerful tools are truly usable to a broader workforce.</p>
<p>The C&amp;AI accessibility team has established a program including an on-demand Inclusive Design feedback channel, prescriptive inclusive usability reviews by end users with disabilities and an internal webinar series to educate product designers and advocate for the rights of all users.</p>
<p>Applause is proud to announce Microsoft’s Cloud &amp; AI Team as the winner for Excellence in Inclusive Design.</p>
<p>“As the world becomes more dependent on technology for daily functions, we’re working day in and day out to ensure that those technologies are accessible for all users,” said Erica Mohler, Principal PM Manager on Microsoft’s Cloud &amp; AI Team. “We’ve found that the best way to do this is to bring accessibility to the forefront of product design and development. Accessibility is not a one-time fix, and it takes a continuous commitment from all of us to make the world more accessible for everyone.”</p>
<p>Excellence in Payment Experiences: Paysafe</p>
<p>Payments are one of many experiences that went through a digital acceleration in 2020, as less people felt safe shopping in-person or using traditional forms of payment, including cash and credit cards. Digital wallets enable shoppers to pay for goods and services faster online due to their superior convenience feature compared to the classic ways of paying.</p>
<p>Paysafe’s core business purpose is to enable users to easily and safely transfer money and run payments around the world via its suite of products, including paysafecard©, NETELLER© and Skrill©. As Paysafe has become more widely used in dozens of countries, its team has recognized that it is critical for customers to avoid friction with third-party services, and that customer experience was highly dependent on factors such as location and device type.</p>
<p>Paysafe’s product team has taken those considerations into account and leverages an innovative testing approach to put its customers’ feedback at the heart of its product processes. Applause is proud to announce Paysafe as the winner of the ACE for Excellence in Payment Experiences.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, payment experiences need to be safe and provide a stellar customer experience,” said Bernhard Niebsch, Paysafe’s Head of Product. “Our team at Paysafe considers CX on a daily basis, and we’ve taken steps to ensure our customers feel satisfied and safe when they’re using our products.”</p>
<p>Excellence in Streaming Experiences: PBS</p>
<p>With a 360-degree approach towards learning and reaching children, PBS KIDS leverages the full spectrum of media and technology to build knowledge, critical thinking, imagination and curiosity. PBS KIDS believes the world is full of possibilities, and so is every child.</p>
<p>While PBS began as a television station, it is now that and more. PBS KIDS, which features beloved series like “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood,” “Wild Kratts,” “Odd Squad,” and more, is available on-air and as a streaming service online and on mobile devices, including iOS, Android and others, and via educational games, apps, and hands-on resources.</p>
<p>PBS KIDS aims to provide children across the United States, especially those who need it most, with access to high-quality content, digital experiences, and resources. Applause is proud to honor PBS with the ACE for Excellence in Streaming Experiences.</p>
<p>“We’re honored to receive this award,” said Sara DeWitt, VP of PBS KIDS Digital. “At PBS KIDS, our mission has always been rooted in making high-quality, educational content accessible to children across the country. We’re proud to continue building on this legacy through innovation in media and technology, meeting kids where they are.”</p>
<p>Excellence in Connected Devices: SimpliSafe</p>
<p>SimpliSafe’s goal is simple: to make every home secure. The Boston-based company fundamentally changed the alarm industry by introducing an affordable, DIY security solution with a mission to make home the safest place on earth for everyone. The company continues to deliver on that mission today, protecting over one million homes from intruders, fires, water damage and more, all while providing customers with an unparalleled user experience.</p>
<p>A wireless and flexible security solution, SimpliSafe is well-suited for homeowners, apartment dwellers and business owners alike looking to graduate from the tired security systems of the past. Customers can arm, disarm and monitor their homes right from their phones, and if their needs or lifestyle changes, customers can add on additional products with ease, whether that be a video doorbell or an extra smoke detector.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe’s functional design and intuitive user experience makes them a stand-out in the home security field, and the winner of this year’s ACE award for Excellence in Connected Devices.</p>
<p>“We believe there is a better way to do home security than the status quo,” said Craig Burger, Software QA Manager, Apps at SimpliSafe. “SimpliSafe’s customizable, DIY approach meets a wide-range of customer needs, making it the go-to system for reliable home protection and monitoring.”</p>
<p>Please join us in congratulating this quarter’s ACE winners on their distinguished achievements and commitment to digital quality. We look forward to honoring more ACE winners in future quarters.</p>

<h3 id="great-escapes-expensify-ceo-david-barretts-five-books-to-help-weather-the-storm">&ldquo;Great Escapes: Expensify CEO David Barrett’s Five Books to Help Weather the Storm&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.barrons.com/im-167269/social" alt="img">
Text size</p>
<p>*Editor’s note: Every Friday Penta runs a travel feature called Great Escapes, a guide to some of the most beautiful and fascinating places around the world. As the coronavirus epidemic sweeps the globe, we’ve decided to focus on escapes closer to home—or, more accurately, in the home—asking notable people about the art, literature, habits, and more that are helping them through this difficult time.</p>
<p>David Barrett first started coding at the age of six. As a middle and high school student in Saginaw, Mich., it was “mostly video games and computer graphics,” he says. “Then the virtual reality lab at the University of Michigan, then VoIP, P2P content distribution, and now fintech.”</p>
<p>It was losing his job as an engineer at the intelligent edge company Akamai during the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, however, that spurred him onto global success. That same year Barrett, 43, had founded Expensify, an app designed to take away the stress of filing expenses, from his home in San Francisco. The app started as a side project—that is until the market crashed. “I lost my job and my savings were wiped out, at which time I devoted myself to it for real,” he says.</p>
<p>Today, the company has 8.5 million users, 130 staff, and offices everywhere from New York to London to Sydney .</p>
<p>As such, Barrett is keen to give back. Until this week, Expensify.org/hunger—one project Expensify dedicated its charitable funds to—helped pay off children’s school lunch debts in America. Now, with schools closed and many Americans in dire financial strain due to the spread of the coronavirus, Expensify has promised instead to match groceries of families enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) with purchases of up to $50. He is asking those with means to consider donating via Expensify.org/donate.</p>
<p>As Barrett said in a newsletter sent out to Expensify’s users: “This is a truly global crisis, and it is only beginning. We all need to work together to weather the storm.”</p>
<p>We asked Barrettfor his five favorite books for a Great Escape at home:</p>
<p>The Three Body Problem, by Liu Cixin , for the most mind-bending ideas about the long-term future of humanity (along with Red Mars, by Kim Stanley Robinson , for a complementary near-term perspective on the future of humanity, putting even enormous problems like population growth and climate change into a relatable context).</p>
<p>Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen , for the best love story ever told (but I think David Copperfield, by Charles Dickens , is a good second).</p>
<p>Prisoners of Geography: Ten Maps That Tell You Everything You Need To Know About Global Politics, by Tim Marshall , for explaining modern conflict—over the past 300 years—in terms of the natural consequence of national borders.</p>
<p>Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise to Western Power, by Victor Davis Hanson , for trying to define and explain the rise of “Western Culture” over the past 3,000 years, and what makes it so economically and militarily powerful.</p>
<p>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, by Jared Diamond , for helping explain the origins of human civilization over the past 30,000 years.
