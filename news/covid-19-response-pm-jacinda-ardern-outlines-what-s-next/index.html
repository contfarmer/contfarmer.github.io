<p>The Prime Minister has committed to doing everything possible to avoid putting the entire country back into lockdown, describing that as a &ldquo;last resort&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Photo: RNZ / Dom Thomas</p>
<p>Jacinda Ardern has laid out Cabinet&rsquo;s plan this morning for if Covid-19 manages to slip through the border and break out in the community.</p>
<p>Speaking at Parliament, she said if community cases emerged, the government would impose restrictions locally or regionally in the first instance, rather than nationwide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our priority will be to control any cases with the least intrusive measures, and over the smallest area we can,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We only need to look to Victoria, New South Wales, Hong Kong, Singapore and Korea to see examples of other places that like us had the virus under control at a point in time only to see it emerge again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rather than being a failing, Ardern said perfection in the response to a virus and pandemic is not possible.</p>
<p>There are now nearly 13 million cases worldwide, Ardern says when New Zealand first closed its borders on 19 March, there were only 240,000 cases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Experts tell us that even with the best precautions possible, the chances of the virus passing from a surface, or a contact with someone who is a carrier are high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must prepare now for that eventuality and have a plan at the ready in the event that it does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ardern said the government will be guided by science and what they know works.</p>
<p>She says the government learnt a lot from the first wave of Covid-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one wants to go backwards but the reality is&hellip; it is not over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the alert level system remains in place, if there was to be cases of Covid-19 in the community, it would be applied on a smaller scale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will move at a local or regional level &hellip; before we would move to national.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is about preparedness, she said, and important to also give businesses some assurances.</p>
<p>The alert level framework can be used locally, nationally or regionally if need be, she said.</p>
<p>But, the first use will be local, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In practical terms, that means doing absolutely everything possible to avoid the entire country returning to alert levels 3 or 4 as a measure of last resort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three scenarios currently being planned for are:</p>
<p>A case or a number of cases in a community</p>
<p>Strong restrictions may be applied but only locally in a neighbourhood, town or city.</p>
<p>Local measures would include contact tracing and isolation of cases and contacts, scaled up and targeted testing of people connected to the case, such as workmates, people in the house or neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The rest of the country would likely remain at Level 1.</p>
<p>A larger number of cases or a cluster in a region</p>
<p>Increase in testing a priority</p>
<p>Health staff may go door to door to test people in affected areas</p>
<p>Much wider community testing on top of contact testing</p>
<p>Regional shift in alert level to restrict travel likely</p>
<p>Local restrictions on gatherings and people asked to work from home</p>
<p>Multiple clusters that have spread nationally</p>
<p>Likely a nationwide increase in alert level</p>
<p>Borders would need to be established to contain locally or regionally, and would be supported by agencies, she said.</p>
<p>She said a regional level 4 would be to contain an outbreak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would maintain a certain level of flexibility depending on what sort of outbreak we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She noted that in other countries, apartment blocks, workplaces and suburbs have all been locked down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The message here is in that eventuality, we wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be moving all of New Zealand at once&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>New Zealand has learned that things move quickly and giving more than 24-48 hour frameworks would lose effectiveness, she said.</p>
<p>Health Minister Chris Hipkins said rapid contract tracing is vitally important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more accurate that is early on, the more targeted we can be in our approach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ardern said she doesn&rsquo;t put a timeline on how long New Zealand&rsquo;s borders will be closed, &ldquo;but it continues to be an area of risk that needs to be managed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said the news of Judith Collins becoming the new opposition leader is taking a &ldquo;bare minimum of her thinking&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think right now, politicking doesn&rsquo;t matter much to them (the public).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hipkins said the contact tracing system will be at a gold standard when every New Zealander is keeping a good record of where they have been and every business has QR codes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s reliant on all of us,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He said over recent weeks he hasn&rsquo;t been as diligent as he should have been but he&rsquo;s stepped up his game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if tomorrow there is notice of a case and we need to notify anyone who came in contact in or near that place,&rdquo; Ardern said.</p>
<p>She said people who test positive for Covid-19 may be removed from the community, and their homes, and put into a facility.</p>
<p>Hipkins said they are looking at different options for further contract tracing.</p>
<p>Ardern said there is an element of personal responsibility in all of this.</p>
<p>But the NZ Covid Tracer app is not a complete solution, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Covid tracing app is all about people controlling their own data,&rdquo; Hipkins said.</p>
<p>In regards to a bubble with Rarotonga, Ardern said she&rsquo;s continuing her discussion with the Cook Island&rsquo;s prime minister.</p>
<p>Very strong physical barriers would be needed at airports for this to happen because there is currently no way to separate someone who is positive from someone who has come from a place with no cases, Ardern said.</p>
<p>She said any trans-Tasman bubble would be restricted to what is happening in each country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously, now is not the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ardern said on the issues of masks, there would be very specific guidance if there were to be outbreaks.</p>
<p>The NZ Covid Tracer app provides speed, unlike other apps, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell people hand on heart that it is an app that looks after your personal security.&rdquo;

New Zealand must prepare for new coronavirus outbreaks as the pandemic spreads globally but will not drop its elimination strategy if community transmission was discovered, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the world of COVID-19 that we’re currently living in, we must constantly be prepared. Today (alongside the Minister of Health) I set out what we will do in the event we have cases in the community again,&rdquo; Ardern wrote on Facebook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we have had no community transmission in New Zealand for over 70 days now, every other country that has been in that position has had a resurgence. If that happens here, we have a plan,&rdquo; she wrote.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern answers questions about the Covid-19 plan and what will happen if there are new cases of community transmission.</p>
<p>OPINION: After a speech setting out how New Zealand would respond if another Covid-19 outbreak was to occur, the Prime Minister was asked about the front-page news of the day: Judith Collins.</p>
<p>Jacinda Ardern demurred, offering neither congratulations nor commiserations for the National Party and its new leader.</p>
<p>“I’m spending more time about New Zealand’s response and economic recovery from Covid-19,” Ardern said.</p>
<p>Stuff Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, left, and new National leader Judith Collins.</p>
<p>“I accept there will be politicking this year. I accept we have an election. But if I’m being brutally honest, my mind hasn’t been focused on that to date.”</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Judith Collins, the new leader of National Party, promises to &lsquo;crush&rsquo; the Government</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It might be &lsquo;team&rsquo; Labour, but there&rsquo;s little doubt about who&rsquo;s the skipper, and &lsquo;saviour&rsquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muller-mania? Yeah, nah.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“I absolutely accept that there is an election this year – and there is no avoiding that – but at the moment it’s taking up a bare minimum of my attention.”</p>
<p>This is a bit of a change from her message when National last changed leaders two months ago. At that point Ardern sent barbed commiserations, saying the party was “recovering” and was “not the party of Key and English any more”.</p>
<p>Monique Ford/Stuff Ardern is still Labour leader as much as she is Prime Minister.</p>
<p>It’s also quite an odd way of putting it. Ardern doesn’t have the choice to “accept” whether there is an election this year. Elections are the means by which the Government has legitimacy and power; not minor inconveniences on the path to Covid-19 recovery.</p>
<p>This kind of language plays into a wider strategy that is emerging from Ardern and Labour to basically pretend there isn’t an election. With the global pandemic continuing to dominate the news cycle it makes total sense to stick to governing, or at least look like you are. “Politicking” is something other parties who are in trouble do, what with their leadership changes and leaking drama, you just get to govern. After all, people like Prime Minister Ardern much more than Labour leader Ardern, and the best campaign is a well-governed country.</p>
<p>But it can be taken too far. Thus far Labour has released a single election policy, which deals with afforestation of farmland and seems mostly engineered to give Kieran McAnulty a good shot in Wairarapa. When you ask about other policy areas, MPs either say “maybe soon” or point to wider government policy on an issue. But the Government is not the Labour Party, it is a set of compromises between Labour and two parties with wildly different views. Kiwis can’t vote for “the Government” – much like they can’t vote for Ardern herself. They can vote for a party, and they deserve a coherent set of values and promises to make that decision on.</p>
<p>Robert Kitchin/Stuff New leader of the opposition Judith Collins.</p>
<p>This stance worked pretty well when National had a leader who didn’t really have any policy either, other than some roads and some nice words about how important jobs are. Until Tuesday, the election looked like it could really boil down to two people both saying slightly different things about the Covid-19 recovery while the Green Party and ACT Party led the policy conversation.</p>
<p>Collins is not likely to stick with the vague business-speak. Her real problem with the John Key years was how little Key did with his extraordinary political capital for the conservative ideological project. Basically every legacy achievement from the last Labour government remained in place at the end of his nine years – think Working for Families, KiwiSaver, four weeks of annual leave, or the Cullen Fund.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that Collins is going to unveil some huge ideological revamp of the National Party tomorrow. She does still want to win the election and can see which way the wind is blowing on certain issues. In her second press conference, she took care to move the party closer to the Government on the border issue, saying we should only open up to Australia when it is “safe”, and also ripped off the sticking plaster and demoted Michael Woodhouse from the health portfolio.</p>
<p>Collins promised to not underestimate Ardern as a foe. Ardern is unlikely to be underestimating Collins in return. But she can only float above the partisan fray for so long. At some point she will need to dig in and fight a real ideological battle with the National Party – especially as its leader is now making promises to “take our country back”. That’s what elections are for.

<h3 id="jacinda-arderns-reaction-to-judith-collins-rising-to-the-top-of-the-national-party">&ldquo;Jacinda Ardern&rsquo;s reaction to Judith Collins rising to the top of the National Party&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/07/jacinda-ardern-s-reaction-to-judith-collins-rising-to-the-top-of-the-national-party/_jcr_content/par/video/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1594773790158/Jacinda-Ardern-Judith-Collins-Newshub-1120.jpg" alt="img">
&ldquo;I will hold her to account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Prime Minister would not be drawn on whether Collins is a threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that I&rsquo;ve been spending more time thinking about New Zealand&rsquo;s response and economic recovery from COVID-19,&rdquo; she said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I absolutely accept that there is an election this year and there is no avoiding that. But at the moment, really it&rsquo;s taking a bare minimum of my thinking because we are still in the middle of a global pandemic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ardern said Collins is her fourth National Party leader opponent. The Labour Party leader has been up against Bill English, Simon Bridges, Todd Muller and now Collins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to admit that I don&rsquo;t really sit down and analyse them all. My focus, my time, my energy is going into our COVID response and that&rsquo;s as it should be,&rdquo; Ardern said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I accept there will be politicking this year, I accept we have an election, but if I&rsquo;m being brutally honest, my mind hasn&rsquo;t been particularly focussed on that to date.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ardern said Kiwis want to see that she&rsquo;s focused on the &ldquo;things that matter&rdquo; to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think right now politicking doesn&rsquo;t matter much to them. They want to know that we&rsquo;re focussed on COVID and I can assure them we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Right-leaning political commentator Trish Sherson told The AM Show Ardern should be worried about Collins and her deputy Gerry Brownlee, because they looked more confident than the previous leadership team of Muller and Nikki Kaye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The difference between when Judith and Gerry emerged from that caucus room last night to 54 days ago when Nikki and Todd emerged. Nikki and Todd came out and they were frowning, they looked uncertain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sherson said Collins has been effective at picking apart the Government&rsquo;s undelivered promises, such as KiwiBuild. The housing programme&rsquo;s failure to live up to initial targets led to the demotion of former Housing Minister Phil Twyford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I think if I were Jacinda, I would be worried,&rdquo; Sherson said. &ldquo;I would be looking at what happened to Phil [Twyford] and going &lsquo;now it is my turn&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But left-leaning commentator Chris Trotter isn&rsquo;t so sure Collins will end up taking National into Government, suggesting she is only there to keep the party base happy and retain as many seats as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does really have the character of a Hail Mary pass for National. She&rsquo;s tried, she failed, she&rsquo;s tried, she failed. Now that the party is in dire straits they reach for her as a drowning man would reach for a lifebuoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latest Newshub-Reid Research poll had Ardern at 59.5 percent as preferred Prime Minister - but that was when Simon Bridges was National Party leader.</p>
<p>Collins wasn&rsquo;t leader then and yet she still made an appearance at 3.1 percent.

<h3 id="judith-crusher-collins-to-take-on-jacinda-ardern-to-become-prime-minister-of-new-zealand">&ldquo;Judith &lsquo;Crusher&rsquo; Collins to take on Jacinda Ardern to become prime minister of New Zealand&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/07/15/06/30780696-0-image-a-43_1594791767602.jpg" alt="img">
Jacinda Ardern will go head-to-head with newly-elected National Party leader Judith &lsquo;Crusher&rsquo; Collins to remain prime minister of New Zealand.</p>
<p>The opposition party elected Ms Collins during an emergency caucus on Tuesday evening following the resignation of Todd Muller.</p>
<p>This is the second time in the country&rsquo;s history that two women are vying for the Top Job in the country&rsquo;s general election.</p>
<p>Ms Collins earned her nickname &lsquo;Crusher Collins&rsquo; as police minister in 2009 when she proposed legislation to confiscate and destroy cars of illegal street racers.</p>
<p>Judith &lsquo;Crusher&rsquo; Collins (right) was elected National Party leader on Tuesday</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am hoping that the National Party can crush the other lot when it comes to September 19,&rsquo; Ms Collins said.</p>
<p>Ms Collins is the fourth National leader since the 2017 election and the party&rsquo;s second female leader.</p>
<p>The 61-year-old was first elected to Parliament in 2002, serving in governments under prime ministers John Key and Bill English.</p>
<p>She held police and corrections portfolios and is seen to represent the right-wing of the National Party, having previously promoted strong law and order policies.</p>
<p>Ms Collins now faces the task of trying to rally support 67 days from the September 19 election.</p>
<p>Recent polls show Labour with sufficient support to form a majority government, a first since New Zealand adopted a system of proportional representation in 1996.</p>
<p>Ms Collins will go head-to-head with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on September 19</p>
<p>All previous governments since that time have been coalitions and Labour currently governs with the support of the Green Party and right-of-centre New Zealand First led by Winston Peters.</p>
<p>Ms Collins admits she is facing a difficult task against Ms Ardern.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I love causes that are looking pretty tough, that&rsquo;s when I tend to get really interested,&rsquo; she told radio station Newstalk ZB.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I obviously thought about whether or not I should put my hands up in the circumstances but I thought&hellip; I can make a difference.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ms Ardern became leader of Labour less than two months before the election in 2017, where she secured her role as prime minister.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old mum-of-one has been praised for her handling of the coronavirus pandemic. New Zealand has recorded just 22 deaths.</p>
<p>Ms Ardern has been praised for her handling of the coronavirus pandemic</p>
<p>Mr Muller, who was the opposition leader for just over 50 days, resigned after citing health reasons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has become clear to me that I am not the best person to be leader of the Opposition and Leader of the New Zealand National Party at this critical time for New Zealand,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is more important than ever that the New Zealand National Party has a leader who is comfortable in the role.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The role has taken a heavy toll on me personally, and on my family, and this has become untenable from a health perspective.&rsquo;</p>
<p>New Zealanders will head to the polls on September 19.

<h3 id="what-judith-collins-can-learn-from-the-jacinda-ardern-miracle--from-someone-who-was-there">&ldquo;What Judith Collins can learn from the Jacinda Ardern miracle – from someone who was there&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jacinda-judith-e1594725680727.jpg" alt="img">
The new National leader has only a few weeks to turn the party’s fortunes around. But that’s what Labour’s new leader did in 2017. While there are obvious differences, there’s plenty Collins can draw from, writes Clint Smith, who was senior communications strategist under Andrew Little and Jacinda Ardern.</p>
<p>It was 56 days from the 2017 election, and I was lying on my living room floor looking at the ceiling.</p>
<p>Labour’s polling was in free-fall. Andrew Little had told Corin Dann on Q+A that he had considered resigning.</p>
<p>Labour’s communications and strategy were in tatters, and I was Labour’s senior communications strategist (a rather grand title for the job of planning, coordinating and writing policy docs, speeches, and related media work).</p>
<p>Was I part of the problem? As I reflected, I realised we actually had a high functioning organisation – caucus wasn’t leaking, staff were working well together, we had won the arguments on housing and health, we had a campaign plan and a big policy programme. What we didn’t have was a leader voters wanted as PM.</p>
<p>I realised what would happen: Andrew is a decent man who puts the movement first. He would resign. Jacinda would become leader unopposed, and she would pull us back up to a decent result. Maybe even win.</p>
<p>Now, National is in a similar position. Like Little, Muller has realised he is not the right person to lead and resigned. Unlike Little, Muller has not softened the ground for a change, and hasn’t helped organise a replacement.</p>
<p>What lessons can National learn from Labour in 2017?</p>
<p>A ready-made leader</p>
<p>The problems with Todd Muller were manifest and manifold. He had no political leadership experience, no public persona, no vision, was visually indistinctive, had nothing interesting to excite media and public attention. It left him to fall into dirty politics and increasingly extreme public statements to try to get attention.</p>
<p>Ardern was already well-known and popular – she was actually ahead of Little in the preferred prime minister polls. She was positive, distinctive, and promoted a vision of a new, kinder politics.</p>
<p>Collins is the ready-made leader National needs. A very well-known politician with a distinct brand. Divisive, yes, but that at least makes her interesting: divisive opposition leaders can win, boring ones can’t. People care about what Collins says. And she has done a good job of moving on from her previous disgraces.</p>
<p>Collins is the only sensible option left for National.</p>
<p>Keep the team and the policy</p>
<p>Ardern inherited from Little a large catalogue of announced policies and a detailed plan of announcements to come (coincidentally Little’s last announcement, like Muller’s, was a road -–the difference being the Manawatu Gorge replacement makes sense).</p>
<p>Ardern kept most of the platform and the notable addition, the Tax Working Group with the prospect of capital gains tax, was a major mistake.</p>
<p>We’re told National has a massive investment plan up its sleeve. If it exists, Collins should keep it and begin rapidly announcing it as her own, as Ardern did. There is no time to create a new platform from whole cloth.</p>
<p>Nor, it appears, is there the capacity in National. People who have worked in parliament have been stunned by the lack of staff in the background of images of National’s caucus run. When Kaye went off to see Goldsmith to check whether he was, in fact, Māori, there was no monitoring press secretary to quietly have a word in her ear as she walked, to stop the madness.</p>
<p>Staffers don’t move politicians like puppeteers, but they are there to advise, help, organise, and try to control or avoid problems. The fact a National MP could send a racist press release without anyone in the leader’s office approving it suggests National’s internal processes have broken down. There aren’t the staff to do the job.</p>
<p>When Ardern became leader, she left all the caucus rankings unchanged, other than necessary changes to bring Kelvin Davis to deputy, and he kept every one of Little’s leader’s office staff. That ensured the machine could keep running.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Muller purged Bridges’ staff, made appointments loyal to him, not the party, and promoted the MPs who drove his coup. National’s caucus is so divided that both Muller and Collins’ elections as leader were leaked from inside the caucus room, denying the leader their chance to announce it.</p>
<p>Collins will, no doubt, have to replace the Muller staffers. Caucus may also demand some MPs, such as Chris Bishop and Nicola Willis, are demoted. There is a compelling case to sack Woodhouse and put Reti in Health. Other than those changes, she should keep absolutely everyone else possible, regardless of personal feelings – another purge will just create more problems. There is no time to rebuild the machine, and it’s already going to lose some big cogs.</p>
<p>Something to vote for</p>
<p>Ardern took the policy platform and organisation that had been built under Little and placed on top of it her vision for a kinder politics. And it worked.</p>
<p>Muller had no vision. His answer was just that National would do everything better. He seemed to genuinely believe it, but it meant he was asking voters to buy a pig in a poke. His inability to say what he would do reminded me of the 18th century stockmarket scam where investors were duped into putting their money into a company “for carrying-on an undertaking of great advantage but no-one to know what it is”.</p>
<p>Collins will need to present a vision. It needn’t be a positive vision in the Ardern sense. But it has to be a picture of New Zealand people can get behind. Donald Trump didn’t run a “positive” campaign but he presented a vision, of an America made great again, which Hillary Clinton did not. Leaders with vision can win elections. Visionless leaders can’t.</p>
<p>Every election boils down to “stick with us, we’re doing well, they would stuff it up” versus “change to us and you’ll get something better, they’re stuffing it up”. Collins will have to make that latter case with less of the carping that the government is stuffing things up and more of how National would make things better.</p>
<p>To that end, she will need to stop the attacks on the world-leading Covid response, which brought down both Bridges and Muller. That negativity felt like an attack on the whole team of 5 million, not just the government, and it became increasingly shrill and out of step with the public’s view that we have done well and that the response, while not perfect, has (with the exception of David Clark) been about all the government could do.</p>
<p>Collins will need to move beyond nitpicking over every minor issue and, instead, detail how she would make New Zealand better in the recovery. “Trust us, we’re National” won’t cut it.</p>
<p>National does not have a Jacinda Ardern waiting in the wings or a united, functioning organisation, or a detailed policy platform. They are essentially starting from scratch with less than 10 weeks to go.</p>
<p>But, until she became leader, nobody knew just what an extraordinary leader Ardern would be, and National does have a proven, canny politician with a strong public persona. There is less for Collins to build on, but if she can at least get the vision right, she can save National from disaster and make a strong case to stay on as leader for another crack in 2023.</p>
