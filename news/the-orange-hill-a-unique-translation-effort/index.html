<p>Verse is the first level of literature of human civilization. Perhaps thousands of years ago, as the mother or grandma made an effort to pacify a crying baby by humming some soulful tune some words fell into place making something meaningful and pleasing to the ear.</p>
<p>That turned popular as it was memorized by people and recited elsewhere and people got the idea of a poem. That is perhaps the reason we get all the epics in the form of verse. Another advantage is that, it is easy to remember and when recited in correct tune the listeners also get mesmerized.</p>
<p>Our ancient texts were memorized by people and recited on relevant occasions. Even in present phase too here, in Assam, in the Naamghar, the devotees offer their prayers reciting entire chapters from Naamghosa and Kirtanghosa completely out of memory.</p>
<p>Ojapali, is also another form of performing art through which an entire episode is recited with graceful movements. As per available records Caryapadas composed between seventh to twelfth century A.D. are the most ancient literary treasure in Assamese language. Poems composed since the time of Ananta Kandali, Madhab Kandali and Sankardeva and Madhabdeva (Considering Borgeets as devotional poems) has crossed various phases like romantic poems, modern poems, post-modern poems. As per some, the present phase is post-post-modern poetry.</p>
<p>Jiban Narah is a known name in the field of Assamese poetry and he has already carved a niche among the present leading poets. He has been playing an important role in representing Assam at national level.</p>
<p>In this collection he has made a special and enviable effort by putting together English translation of his poems by all the leading translators of Assam right from Padmashree Dhirendra Nath Bezbarua, Dr. Hiren Gohain, Pradip Acharya, Krishna Dulal Barua, Lyra Neog Bora, Nirendra Nath Thakuria and Dibya Khataniar.</p>
<p>This has added a unique dimension to the book. In the very brief translators note it is mentioned that Jiban Narah has made a distinctive contribution to Assamese literature in including many facets of Mising language and culture in his poetry. The forward is written by – one of most leading poet – litterateur of India, former Secretary of Sahitya Akademy and also a former editor of Indian Literature – the bi-monthly prestigious literary journal of Sahitya Akademy Sri K Satchidanandan. The introduction is written by Prabhat Bora.</p>
<p>The opening lines of the forward reads thus – Jiban Narah is easily one of the finest Indian poets writing in Asomiya today. Though heir to the great modernist tradition of Navkanta Barua and Nilmoni Phukan in his language, Jiban creates a poetic world of his own as he also inherits the older Vaishnavite Bhakti tradition of Sankardeva and Madhabdeva as well as the rich oral tradition of Mising and he works his way through tales from Bhagavata and Mising myths and picks his colourful images from the riverine tribe that lives in bamboo stilt-houses and thrives on agriculture.</p>
<p>The beautiful complexity and the splendid fantasy of the poems spring from these multiple traditions his blood carries. Jiban represents a new voice in Indian poetry that springs from peripheral people and dialects and creates languages interrogating the status quo poetic idiom as well as the standard language that is considered the ‘mainstream’.</p>
<p>Eminent Assamese scholar and critic Prabhat Bora writes in the introduction – Jiban Narah, one of the finest and most gifted poets of contemporary Assam, was born to an impoverished Mising family in a small village of northern part of Golaghat district in Central Assam. Morongial, Jiban’s village, surrounded by three rivers, the Brahmaputra and its three tributaries – Dhansiri and Gelabeel, is so beautiful and vibrant with oi-nitom, the Mising traditional love song that it would turn even a man with a most prosaic heart into a poet at least for some time….I can still remember how on my way back I was haunted by the Wrdworthian feeling as though I returned from a visit to the Wye Valley, and surely a new Tintern Abbey would have been to me credit if I had been gifted with a sort of serendipity.</p>
<p>One must thank the publisher as well as the poet for the very rare forward and introduction which actually stands as a model for other writers to follow as it reflects the wide area of study by two eminent people and the way they present the comparison and bring in references of other writings.</p>
<p>This collection includes one translated poem by Dr. Hiren Gohain, four by Dhirendra Nath Bezbarua, twelve by Pradip Acharya, three by Nirendra Nath Thakuria, ten by Krishna Dulal Barua, three by Dibya Khataniar, and the maximum of eighteen by Lyra Neog Bora. The title poem has been translated by Lyra Neog Bora.</p>
<p>The sample of works of different translators are put below for a glimpse</p>
<p>My rhythmic body passes / To and fro / Through the echoing song / Feet quicken into movement/ Hands beat like wings/ And in the night’s courtyard/ Observed by thousands/ A dirge rises from my throat ~ RHYTHM ~ Dr. Hiren Gohain</p>
<p>Someone has said/ The universe will collapse/ Alongwith the sun and earth// In any case, the universe exists/ Only till people are not dead/ Just as the earth water and the sun do // What happens after that / Are the fables of scriptures// There is happiness in fables;/But even they are what Man creates ~ MY IMAGINARY STORY-TELLER ~ D N Bezbaruah</p>
<p>You’re reading your face/ in your palms// In the mirror of your palms/ falls the shadows of veins// Bearing in that shade/ the eyes furtively search for/ days and nights/ for another pair of eyes// You lay your face on your palms/ on another face ~ MIRROR ` Pradip Acharya</p>
<p>Men and poets aren’t the same/// Men have masks/Poets haven’t / For it’s masks that poets are made of// Men have blots/ Poets haven’t/ For its mishaps where poets made of // Men have mishaps/ poets haven’t/ For it’s blots that poets are born ~ FACE AND MASK~ Krishna Dulal Barua</p>
<p>The orange hill/ Is rushing// With their young ones/ the pigs are screaming// The fire is flying its red flames//The red flames/ are devouring/ the tips of the trees// The pigs are running after the oranges// The men are running / with bullet and blood ~ THE ORANGE HILL ~ Lyra Neog Bora</p>
<p>Your face/ a door to divine love// Your eyes/ spread over the sky// You are there in that village where you were born/ yet you are here//A face soft and serene/ my mother/ Take me into your arms ~ YOUR FACE ~ Lyra Neog Bora</p>
<p>With the globe on its back/ an ant is running// After it runs our daughter/ and her friends// Following them/ are the sun and moon// Day and night//The globe on an ant’s back/ running/ running ~ THE GLOBE ON AN ANT’S BACK~ Lyra Neog Bora</p>
<p>O Buddha/ in what language/ do we read dreams/ in sleep at night/ What’s the difference/ between your ‘sunya’/ and Aryabhatta’s ‘0’/ The earth is round/ not exactly round/ roundish/../ Are you awoken/ O Buddha/ Someone calls at fever pitch/ snapping apart the wood/ a green shroud is trotting about// Where’s the sun/ has it flopped down/ on the bed of the wood ~THE BUDDHA~Nirendra Nath Thakuria</p>
<p>The day I met her/ distant clouds hung from the boughs/ basking in the sun // Drawing its sap from the rain grew/ that road bend of memory/ loaded with leaves and branches// Now shadows of loaded trees/ are growing long and luxurious/ on either side of the grave~CORPOREAL THOUGHTS/2 ~ Dibya Khataniar</p>
<p>Each translator has one’s unique style and has specific place of reputation. So one gets a wide variety of taste as regards use of words and expressions, and it takes out the monotony. Though the poet is the same because of the mixed platter of translators, it has got a different dimension. To get all the eminent translators of a State between the same covers is also a unique achievement for the poet as well</p>
<p>This compilation has been dedicated to two departed stalwarts of literature – one is Late Nabakanta Barua from Assam and the other eminent Malayalam poet, literary critic, teacher and scholar Late K Ayyappa Paniker. We are hopeful that this unique translation effort would soon be considered as a milestone in establishing Assamese literature in the world forum.</p>

<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WE0xYoyVlKAJDWlfOKJ_Iw--~B/aD0zMDk7dz00MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/prnewswire.com/eddee393f209ecd27402cc398c5e8fb5" alt="img">
LOS ANGELES, July 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ &ndash; The team at Timekettle is proud to announce the launch of an offline translation feature, the latest software upgrade to its flagship device, Timekettle WT2 Plus translator earbuds. The software upgrade is also available across its other translation products.</p>
<p>Timekettle WT2 Plus Offline Translation More</p>

Timekettle – compatible with both iOS and Android – opens up a new world of natural communication possibilities for people around the world, moving toward more organic translations where the focus is always on talking to people, rather than the mechanics of translation software.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether traveling for business or pleasure, multilingual conversations have long been a source of frustration. Online translators were a great innovation, but for those on the streets and far from an internet connection, relatively useless. With the WT2 Plus&rsquo; new offline capabilities, Timekettle has opened a whole new world of limitless communication,&rdquo; said Leal Tian, CEO of Timekettle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are always looking for ways to add more value to our products so that our users enjoy the maximum benefits. Unlike many tech companies in this space, our focus is on intimate human to human interaction, rather than the more mechanical interaction of human and machine back to human again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The offline translation feature marks the latest improvement in a series of upgrades in the past six months. In that time, Timekettle has boosted its language pairs, bringing users fluent access to over forty languages with ninety-three accents while also bolstering its global infrastructure with two new servers in Moscow and Sao Paulo, bringing the total up to fourteen.</p>
<p>The AI translator&rsquo;s ability to capture conversations with up to 93% accuracy on the go has won it many fans. &ldquo;We are constantly working on improving our service so that people can communicate effortlessly, no matter where they are,&rdquo; added Tian. &ldquo;More than just helping the world to talk, we&rsquo;re invested in continually working to make the Timekettle experience as user-friendly, convenient, and efficient as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="black-eyed-peas--shakira-win-best-translation-collaboration-in-fan-poll">&ldquo;Black Eyed Peas &amp; Shakira Win Best &lsquo;Translation’ Collaboration in Fan Poll&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.billboard.com/files/media/07-shakira-bb11-2018-ssklisx-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg" alt="img">
As the Black Eyed Peas continue making the rounds with their star-studded collaborative Translation, fans officially picked the best joint on the album.</p>
<p>With over 56 percent of the votes, “Girl Like Me” with Shakira takes the crown after a two-week Billboard poll circulated. The fourth track on the set is full of infectious flavors from tropical to dance to soca. She’s followed by the J Balvin-assisted “Ritmo (Bad Boys For Life)” and the “Feel the Beat” with Maluma.</p>
<p>“I was so inspired,” will.i.am previously told Billboard of working with Shak. “[She was like,] ‘Did you get my notes?’ ‘I got your notes.’ ‘OK. Let’s begin. Note No. 1: When you say that word, can you swing that back a little bit? When I say, ‘Girl like me,’ the tail end of the reverb, can you make it just a little bit louder?’ This girl is the definition of music. I’ve worked with everybody — Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson. I’ve never experienced that detail. And she conducts the session like she’s teaching!”</p>
<p>Of their first-ever collaborative effort, the Colombian singer expressed the same. “Will, it was also a pleasure to work with you guys!! The story behind this song, your vision, your talent, and passion make this experience an absolute highlight in my career!!” she wrote on social media.</p>
<p>Full of global rhythms and Spanglish bops, Translation, out June 19 via Epic Records, is home to 15 fresh tracks—10 of which are collaborations. See the poll results and listen to “Girl Like Me” below.

<h3 id="sofia-coppolas-lost-in-translation-published-in-persian">&ldquo;Sofia Coppola’s “Lost in Translation” published in Persian&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.tehrantimes.com/d/t/2020/07/05/4/3493144.jpg" alt="img">
TEHRAN – American filmmaker, actress, and writer Sofia Coppola’s book “Lost in Translation” has recently been published in Persian.</p>
<p>Ruhollah Zamzameh is the translator of the book published by Minoo in Tehran.</p>
<p>The book is about Bob Harris, a fading American movie star who arrives in Tokyo to appear in lucrative advertisements. He is staying at the upscale Park Hyatt Tokyo and is suffering from strains in his 25-year marriage and a midlife crisis. Charlotte, another American staying at the hotel, is a young college graduate who is accompanying her husband while he works as a celebrity photographer in Japan. Charlotte is feeling similarly disoriented as she questions her recent marriage and is unsure about her future.</p>
<p>Bob and Charlotte grapple with additional feelings of jetlag and culture shock in Tokyo and frequently happen upon each other in the hotel. After several chance encounters, Charlotte invites Bob into the city to meet some local friends. The two bond through a fun night in Tokyo, where they experience the city nightlife together. In the days that follow, Bob and Charlotte spend more time together and their friendship strengthens. One night, while each are unable to sleep, the two share an intimate conversation about Charlotte’s personal uncertainties and their married lives.</p>
<p>The pair encounter each other again in the evening, when Bob reveals that he will be leaving Tokyo the following day.</p>
<p>The following morning, when Bob is leaving the hotel, he and Charlotte share sincere but unsatisfactory goodbyes.</p>
<p>In 2003, Coppola made a film adaptation of the story, which won her the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and the Golden Globes Best Actor award for Bill Murray for the portrayal of Bob Harris.</p>

Το έλεγε ο Λουί Αραγκόν, το υποστηρίζει και ο Τίτος Πατρίκιος. Οι μεταφράσεις των κλασικών έργων, είτε αυτά είναι θεατρικά είτε λογοτεχνικά, θα έπρεπε κάθε τριάντα χρόνια να αλλάζουν. Ο λόγος είναι προφανής. Μέσα σε αυτόν τον κύκλο του χρόνου αλλάζουν οι αναφορές της γλώσσας, το σημαινόμενο των λέξεων, ακόμη και οι σύγχρονοι ανθρωπότυποι στους οποίους, πολύ συχνά, γίνονται προβολές κλασικών ηρώων. Τυχαίο παράδειγμα ανάμεσα στα πολλά, πριν από λίγα χρόνια, το μυθιστόρημα ο «Φύλακας στη σίκαλη» του Σάλιντζερ, γραμμένο το 1951, κυκλοφόρησε όχι μόνο με νέα μετάφραση στα ελληνικά από την Τζένη Μαστοράκη, αλλά και με καινούργιο τίτλο. «Στη σίκαλη, στα στάχια, ο πιάστης».</p>
<p>Τριάντα χρόνια, τριάντα ένα για την ακρίβεια, έχουν περάσει και από το – όπως πέρασε στο πολιτικό λεξιλόγιο – «βρώμικο ’89». Η απεγνωσμένη προσπάθεια του ΣΥΡΙΖΑ λοιπόν να «μεταφράσει» τα όσα επέσυρε η αποκάλυψη των διαλόγων ανάμεσα στον Νίκο Παππά και τον Σάμπυ Μιωνή αλλά και οι αποκαλύψεις της εφημερίδας «Παραπολιτικά», με προ τριακονταετίας όρους, δείχνει απλώς ότι στην αξιωματική αντιπολίτευση είναι, λίγο έως εντελώς, χαμένοι στη μετάφραση – χωρίς, βέβαια, την υποφώσκουσα ατμόσφαιρα της ταινίας της Σοφίας Κόπολα.</p>
<p>Η Μπόνι, ο Κλάιντ, ο Κλέαρχος, η Μαρίνα κι ο κοντός</p>
<p>Ας πούμε, το 1989 («βρώμικο» ή «ξεπλυμένο» σε απορρυπαντικό με κόκκινους, πράσινους και μπλε κόκκους) σε σχέση με τα σημερινά είναι σαν να προσπαθείς να μεταφράσεις το «Μπόνι και Κλάιντ» και να σου βγαίνει «Ο Κλέαρχος, η Μαρίνα κι ο κοντός». «Αν έχουν τα κότσια και δεν είναι απλά θρασύδειλοι, εγώ είμαι εδώ […] Μην κουράζονται και μη φθείρονται χρησιμοποιώντας το παρακράτος των μαφιόζικων υποκλοπών και των υπόδικων εκδοτών και επιχειρηματιών που τους στηρίζουν. Αν πιστεύουν ότι τους ευνοεί ένα ριμέικ του βρώμικου ’89, ας διευρύνουν το κατηγορητήριο και ας με συμπεριλάβουν» είπε ο Αλέξης Τσίπρας στο συνέδριο της Κεντρικής Επιτροπής Ανασυγκρότησης. Και είναι σαν να βλέπεις τον Νίκο Ρίζο στον ρόλο του Γουόρεν Μπίτι. Εξαιρετικός κωμικός ο Ρίζος, δεν λέω, αλλά όση σχέση έχει με τον Μπίτι, άλλη τόση έχει ο Τσίπρας με τον Ανδρέα Παπανδρέου. Αλλο να είσαι εσύ ο ίδιος ο ρόλος και άλλο να τον υποδύεσαι.</p>
<p>Αλλη εποχή, άλλοι άνθρωποι, άλλες συνθήκες. Και, κυρίως, άλλο ύφος. Μεγάλο θέμα το υφολογικό. Εξ αυτού εκπορεύεται ηθική. Το τραγικό όμως (και με τη θεατρική έννοια του όρου) είναι να φέρεσαι και να μιλάς αγοραία εξ ονόματος της ηθικής. Τα «μαγαζιά» και οι «τύπισσες» του Νίκου Παππά είναι απόρροια του τσαμπουκά της «δρακογενιάς». Μια σουσουδίστικη νοοτροπία που ξεχωρίζει τους «νοικοκυραίους» από τους «τιμονιέρηδες» και μεταμορφώνει την ηρωίδα του Δημήτρη Ψαθά σε κουτσαβάκι. Τι σχέση έχει όλο αυτό με τον Ανδρέα Παπανδρέου;</p>
<p>Μεταφρασμένα και αμετάφραστα</p>
<p>Είσαι έμπορος, έχεις ένα μαγαζάκι στην Ερμού που, με νύχια και με δόντια, προσπαθείς να κρατήσεις ανοιχτό εδώ και χρόνια. Ερχεται το lockdown και σου δίνει τη χαριστική βολή. Συνεχίζεις όμως έστω και αγκομαχώντας. Με την ελπίδα ότι θα περάσει κι αυτό. Κι έρχεται ένα ωραίο βράδυ του Ιουνίου και σου σπάνε τη βιτρίνα. Στο όνομα της αειφόρου επανάστασης και για να ξορκιστεί το τέρας του καπιταλισμού. …Αυτό δεν χρειάζεται μετάφραση. Είναι εσπεράντο.

In the last four months, Senay Imre and Robert Kris, both 34, have had to contend with travel bans, quarantines, flight restrictions, safety distancing and a rescinded curfew order — all ramifications of the coronavirus — before they finally married June 9 in Istanbul.</p>
<p>Ekrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul, officiated at the Florya lstanbul Metropolitan Municipality in Florya.</p>
<p>“Marrying Robert certainly required a good deal of patience,” said Ms. Imre, who was born and raised in Istanbul. She met Mr. Kris, who is from New York’s Upper East Side, in September 2018 on his first day working as a diplomat at the U.S. Consulate General in Istanbul.</p>
<p>Mr. Kris, who worked in the consulate’s political/economic section, was on the job for only a few minutes when Ms. Imre, who joined the consulate the year before, walked down a flight of stairs and into his life.
