<p>CLOSE</p>
<p>TUCSON — Protesters on the Mexican side of the border blocked for several hours on Wednesday the Mexico-bound lanes at the main border crossing in the twin border cities of Ambos Nogales, to express their displeasure with the Mexican government&rsquo;s response so far to the new coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>They demanded greater controls and screenings on southbound traffic at the U.S.-Mexico border out of concern that travelers from the U.S. could import new cases of the coronavirus into Mexico.</p>
<p>Less than a dozen people wearing face masks and carrying signs used two of their vehicles for a blockade of the two southbound lanes at the DeConcini crossing, several hundred feet into the Mexican side of the border, video taken by Mexican media showed.</p>
<p>Some of the signs asked U.S. residents to &ldquo;stay at home.&rdquo; Others called on Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to step up controls and restrictions along the U.S.-Mexico border to contain the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Thenumber of confirmed cases in the U.S., the third highest in the world, is significantly higher than Mexico, a situation that is also true along the states on both sides of the border.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday afternoon, Arizona&rsquo;s Department of Health Services has confirmed more than 400 cases, including at least six deaths resulting from the coronavirus. All four Arizona border counties confirmed additional cases Wednesday, including Santa Cruz County, which includes Nogales.</p>
<p>Sonora, Arizona&rsquo;s neighbor to the south, has confirmed a total of four cases of COVID-19 statewide, according to state health officials. None of those cases are from Sonora&rsquo;s border communities.</p>
<p>Blockade is the &lsquo;first warning&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jose Luis Hernandez, with the group called Sonorenses por la Salud y la Vida (Sonorans for Health and Life), explained the reason for Wednesday’s blockade. He called it the “first warning” for López Obrador.</p>
<p>“There are no health screenings by the federal government to deal with this pandemic,” he said. “That’s why we’re here in Nogales. We’ve taken this action to call on the Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to act now.”</p>
<p>The group presented a set of demands, warning that they would take similar action again if the Mexican government fails to act. Their demands mirror a set of restrictions that the U.S. government began enforcing at the border over the weekend.</p>
<p>The demands call for a temporary ban on visits for tourism and minor medical procedures in Mexico for both U.S. citizens as well as Mexicans living in the U.S. The group is asking for Mexican health officials to step up screenings of everybody crossing the border for symptoms of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The protesters emphasized the risk to border communities if health officials don&rsquo;t properly screen all migrants that U.S. border officials are deporting or sending back into Mexico.</p>
<p>Hernandez said the restrictions shouldn’t impact trade and commerce, including the region’s profitable winter produce industry and the manufacturing plants that employ thousands in Mexico.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is for your health. This is for your family,&rdquo; Hernandez said. &ldquo;Or what do you want to happen? That this becomes worse given the irresponsibility of the Mexican government? Of course not. That’s why were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last week, the U.S. and Mexican governments agreed to restrict travel along the border, limiting it to &ldquo;essential&rdquo; reasons, such as medical emergencies, school or work.</p>
<p>However, few controls are in place at the border crossings on the Mexican side of the border to enforce those restrictions.</p>
<p>State health officials in Sonora separately deployed its staff to border crossings last week, including at the DeConcini crossing. But they were mostly stationed at the pedestrian crossings.</p>
<p>Few cars were able to maneuver around the blockade, forcing a bottleneck in southbound traffic in downtown Nogales, Arizona.</p>
<p>Officers with the Nogales Police Department in Arizona began redirecting Mexico-bound traffic at Crawford Street, several hundred yards north of the entrance to the DeConcini port of entry.</p>
<p>Southbound traffic into Mexico is closed at the DeConcini Port of Entry. Please use Mariposa Port of Entry. NPD is conducting traffic control, please be patient as officers direct traffic. — Nogales Police (@NogalesPoliceAz) March 25, 2020</p>
<p>Officer Oscar Mesta, a Nogales police spokesman, said officers are redirecting drivers to the Mariposa border crossing, located on the western side of Nogales. Pedestrian traffic at the DeConcini crossing was not impacted by the blockade, he said.</p>
<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials in Nogales said the traffic at the DeConcini crossing had reopened at about 5:30 p.m. Wednesday.</p>
<p>Nogales, Arizona, issued a statement Wednesday acknowledging the blockade on the Mexican side of the border and warning of potentially negative impacts on the city if it continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nogales Police anticipates demonstrations may continue tomorrow. The closure of any Port of Entry will negatively impact commerce and the way of life in Nogales,&rdquo; the city&rsquo;s statement said.</p>
<p>Mexican president widely criticized</p>
<p>López Obrador has been widely criticized in Mexico for his tepid response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He has continued to hold mass rallies around the country, where he shakes hands with supporters and kisses babies.</p>
<p>Last week, during one of his morning news conferences, he said that &ldquo;honesty&rdquo; was the best protection against the virus, and then proceeded to pull out two religious icons from his wallet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are my bodyguards,&rdquo; López Obrador told reporters.</p>
<p>On Sunday, he once again drew widespread condemnation throughout the country when he said that Mexican culture made them &ldquo;very resistant to all calamities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>López Obrador also urged Mexicans to continue going out for dinner with their families to support the economy, defying the advice from medical professionals in Mexico and around the globe who have instead called on people to stay home as a best practice to avoid the spread of the COVID-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are still in the first phase,&rdquo; López Obrador said. &ldquo;I will tell you when not to go out anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This week, as Mexico entered the second phase of community transmission, federal health officials in Mexico City finally called for stricter measures in Mexico, such as limiting large gatherings.</p>
<p>Several Mexican states, including Sonora, introduced these types of measures days or weeks ago.</p>
<p>On March 16, Sonora Gov. Claudia Pavlovich implemented a series of restrictions after the state confirmed its first case, an elderly man who had traveled in the days prior to the United States.</p>
<p>Sonora banned gatherings larger than 10 people, and called for the closures of all schools and non-essential businesses such as gyms, bars and movie theaters.</p>

<h3 id="mexican-border-town-uses-sanitizing-tunnels-to-disinfect-us-visitors-from-covid-19">&ldquo;Mexican border town uses ‘sanitizing tunnels’ to disinfect US visitors from Covid-19&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/884b595048f7084f5c3adcf416cd1867f1a950ad/36_0_1010_606/master/1010.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=f2f358eb574b1b0274aaa3b65bc7b29b" alt="img">
Authorities in Nogales, Sonora, are hoping to reduce chances of bringing the virus over from Arizona, one of the states most affected</p>
<p>Fears of foreigners bringing infectious disease into the country. Enhanced border checkpoints. And the use of disinfectant spray to sanitize human beings.</p>
<p>These aren’t notes from one of Donald Trump’s freewheeling press conferences. The United States’ troubled response to the coronavirus pandemic is such that the Mexican border city of Nogales, Sonora, has set up “sanitizing tunnels” to disinfect people leaving the US through Nogales, Arizona.</p>
<p>Mexico&rsquo;s López Obrador holds daily briefings rivalling Trump’s: ‘A spectacle without any value’ Read more</p>
<p>On the Mexican side of two major border crossings, drivers coming from Arizona must exit their vehicles and step into an inflatable tunnel that sprays them with a cleansing solution.</p>
<p>Videos posted to social media by the municipal government of Nogales, Sonora, show people rotate under the vapor, stretch their arms and lean over to allow the disinfectant to reach their entire bodies.</p>
<p>Gobierno Nogales (@GobNogales) Instalamos uno de los cinco módulos sanitizantes en la garita de cruce internacional “Mariposas”, que forma parte de las acciones que realizan las autoridades estatales y federales para prevenir el contagio de “Coronavirus” (COVID-19). pic.twitter.com/H6nYyy44X5</p>
<p>In a press release, the Nogales government states that the cleansing solution is biodegradable and protects from “any virus or bacteria, including Covid-19” for up to 24 hours. It adds that the tunnels “reduce the chances that a foreign citizen or citizen of this city who presents symptoms of the disease will infect other people on the Mexican side”.</p>
<p>The border city’s mayor has told Mexican news outlets that a majority of the people who have tested positive for Covid-19 in Nogales, Sonora, had recently returned from the US.</p>
<p>The Mexican border city plans to install five sanitizing tunnels to disinfect people arriving through its two main ports of entry from Nogales, Arizona. A sanitizing tunnel is also stationed outside a hospital in Nogales, Sonora, where visitors must brush open or duck through clear plastic curtains to be washed with the disinfectant mist.</p>
<p>News reports identify the cleansing solution as biozinc. On its Facebook page, the government of Nogales, Sonora, announced on 7 May that “this measure came in response to requests from Nogales citizens to avoid infections from Arizona, one of the states most affected by coronavirus in the American Union”.</p>
<p>Arizona has more than 11,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and a death toll of over 500 people. The Navajo Nation in the north-eastern corner of the state has been hit especially hard and continues to reel from a per-capita infection rate surpassed only by New York and New Jersey.</p>
<p>Sonora, Mexico, has just over 400 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including 32 in Nogales. But doctors in Mexico City have come forward in the recent days to warn that the true toll of the virus has been dramatically underreported by the federal government as many people treated for Covid-19 symptoms fail to receive coronavirus tests, even when they die.

<h3 id="late-blitz-frees-ironwood-from-resilient-nogales-squad">&ldquo;Late blitz frees Ironwood from resilient Nogales squad&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn4.creativecirclemedia.com/yourvalley/original/20200223-015709-IMG_1291.jpg" alt="img">
WEST VALLEY PREPS</p>
<p>Posted Sunday, February 23, 2020 2:13 am</p>
<p>In a vaccum, the 86-62 victory looks like another Ironwood baskball blowout, the Eagles&rsquo; fifth straight win of 14 points or more.</p>
<p>But the 5A quarterfinal inside a packed Glendale gym Feb. 21 certainly did not feel like a rout - for the first three quarters at least. #10 seed Nogales ran with #2 Ironwood and used their constant motion and pinpoint passing to lead 47-45 with under three minutes left in the third.</p>
<p>Then junior guard Bailon Black lit the match, draining a 25-foot three pointer to give the home team a 54-49 lead. Senior forward David Teibo stole the ball, spun in the lane and hit a layup, then senior guard Trend Hudgens swiped the inbound pass and was fouled.</p>
<p>Ironwood&rsquo;s 8-0 run in the final minute of the quarter built a 59-49 lead. Now Nogales had to chase the game - a daunting prospect given the ballhandling, passing ang shooting abilities af the Eagles&rsquo; four guards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believed that we could take advantage of the fact that we&rsquo;re a very deep team. It&rsquo;s been a long time since we played against a team that wanted to play fast. We felt like at a certain point with how fast we want to play that they would get worn down. They really didn&rsquo;t until Bailon&rsquo;s three.&rdquo; Ironwood coach Jordan Augustine said. &ldquo;They played that 1-2-2 and did a really good job with it. Once we built a 10-point lead, they couldn&rsquo;t just sit back any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The win book&rsquo;s the program&rsquo;s third trip to the semifinals in more than 30 years of play, and the first since 1996.</p>
<p>Ironwood hosts region Rival and #6 Phoenix Sunnyslope (23-5) at 7 p.m. Feb. 27.Sunnyslope won its preseason tournament final in the teams&rsquo; first meeting, only for Ironwood to rebound and claim both league games.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is huge for our school, the third time we&rsquo;ve made it to the final four. The way that it&rsquo;s galvanized our community has been awesome,&rdquo; Augustine said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to take everything we have in order for us to compete with Sunnyslope. It&rsquo;s going to be as packed as it was tonight. But it&rsquo;s going to be nice to get to play one more here and no matter what it&rsquo;s our senior&rsquo;s last home game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Initially, the home team was on its heels, and the raucous crowd filling the visiting bleachers surged with each Apache layup. Nogales repeatedly drove, drew the defense and found cutters in building early leads of 10-3, 16-7 and 21-13.</p>
<p>Yet the Eagles were leading 24-23 by the end of the first quarter. Their press forced several turnovers, which senior forward Jaden Glass converted into two layups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did a lot of new things tht we didn&rsquo;t see on film. In the first five minutes it was challenging. It took us a while to get a feel for their sets and what they were about,&rdquo; White said. &ldquo;We thought our press was going to get turnovers, but they have good ball movement. Once it wasn&rsquo;t working, we made that adjustment. We know the on-ball defenders we have on this team and it made a difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>White was the steadying force with seven first-quarter points. Nogales did not retreat, cutting the lead to 31-29 in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Hudgens answered with a trey. He led all scorers with 11 at the half, and his team took a 36-33 advantage into the locker room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be honest, the film didn&rsquo;t do them justice. They played extremely well and are well coached. In two days to pick up some of the stuff that they picked up and do what they did against us, I thought they were extremely well prepared,&rdquo; Augustine said.</p>
<p>Nogales battled back in the early third quarter and took three brief leads, the last two resulting from threes by sophomore guard Edgardo Zubiate.</p>
<p>Zubiate was his team&rsquo;s second-leading scorer with 15 points. Junior forward Steven Legelu led the visitors with 20, and senior forward Julian Grijalva added 13.</p>
<p>Grijalva&rsquo;s fourth foul, late in the third quarter after Zubiate gave the Apaches a 47-45 lead, was crucial. Nogales did not get much from its bench, and Ironwood attacked immediately, with senior guard Dominic Gonzalez hitting a pair of treys.</p>
<p>Zubiate answered with a two, then Black&rsquo;s deep three kicked the Eagles into overdrive. With this team the big run seems inevitable - the only question is how it starts and which player starts it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the second half we told each other to calm down,&rdquo; White said. &ldquo;Shots like (Black&rsquo;s) take a lot out of the other team because they know they played good defense and a shot like that still goes in. That shot changed momentum and after that, everything went our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Legelu hit a three to start the fourth quarter. But Ironwood scored the next seven points to lead 66-52.</p>
<p>The Apaches hung around a while longer, but Teibo dunked to the roar of the crowd and a 72-56 advantage. Ironwood dominated from there, with Hudgens dunk in the final 20 seconds the exclamation point.</p>
<p>To drive home the balance of their attack, Gonzalez led all scorers with 21 points, Hudgens and White tied for second with 20 points each.</p>
<p>&ldquo;J.J. was extremely solid. Bailon has probably been our most consistent guy and him being in foul trouble in the first half hurt us a lot. Dom finally hit some threes in the second half after missing some that he usually doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Augustine said. &ldquo;Atmosphere-wise this was every bit as unbelievable as playing Millennium last year in this exact same game.

<h3 id="ducey-improving-state-route-189-means-better-roads-future-for-arizona">&ldquo;Ducey: Improving State Route 189 means better roads, future for Arizona&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn4.creativecirclemedia.com/yourvalley/original/20200304-182024-sr189%20rendering.jpg" alt="img">
Posted Wednesday, March 4, 2020 6:23 pm</p>
<p>Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and state, local and federal officials broke ground Wednesday on a $134 million project to improve mobility and safety on a 3.75-mile Nogales highway.</p>
<p>The project, once completed, will help increase international trade coming through Nogales by linking the Mariposa Port of Entry and Interstate 19, according to a release.</p>
<p>The Arizona Department of Transportation’s upgrades along State Route 189, including flyover ramps connecting with the interstate, will eliminate the need for commercial trucks to stop as many as three times between I-19 and the international border as they travel to and from markets across Arizona and the U.S.</p>
<p>“We know that better roads mean a better future for Arizona,” Mr. Ducey said. “The improvements along State Route 189 will improve safety, enhance trade and foster an even stronger relationship with our neighbors in Mexico. With record trade already with Mexico, my thanks to the Arizona Department of Transportation, our partners in Mexico and everyone working to improve our infrastructure and attract even more trade through our ports.”</p>
<p>The Mariposa Port of Entry saw about $24.1 billion in imports and exports in 2018, including much of the winter produce consumed in the U.S., according to the release. Up to 1,800 commercial trucks use SR 189 daily during the winter months.</p>
<p>Mr. Ducey hosted officials at a groundbreaking event March 4 near the interchange of I-19 and SR 189, known locally as Mariposa Road. Construction is expected to begin in April and take about 18 months to complete.</p>
<p>A $25 million appropriation by the state of Arizona as well as a highly competitive $25 million federal Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery grant will allow ADOT to build the entire project at once, rather than in two phases. The expedited timeline will result in a savings of $13 million.</p>
<p>The project also will benefit Nogales residents and businesses by reducing congestion on one of the community’s primary roads.</p>
<p>“Moving large commercial trucks to the new flyover ramps will not only benefit the trucking industry but will improve traffic flow and make Mariposa Road safer for all,” ADOT Director John Halikowski said.</p>
<p>The flyover ramps, which will connect with SR 189 west of Frank Reed Road, will increase safety for students of nearby Nogales High School. The project also includes a new roundabout at Target Range Road and improved drainage and traffic signals, among other improvements.</p>
<p>Local officials touted the project’s importance not just for Nogales and Santa Cruz County but all of Arizona.</p>
<p>“During my first administration in 2011 we talked about ways to improve State Route 189, and now it’s real,” Nogales Mayor Arturo Garino said. “This is a very good project that is important for the city of Nogales and for the entire state of Arizona economically.”</p>
<p>Bruce Bracker, a Santa Cruz County supervisor, called the improvements critical for the continued growth of the region.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The modernization of SR 189 will greatly help with congestion along the corridor and address major safety concerns, particularly with the grade-separation that will provide a safer environment for the high school traffic and traffic in general,” Bracker said. “It is critical that we promote this project and attract new investment and create new jobs in our community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jaime Chamberlain, chairman of the Greater Nogales Santa Cruz County Port Authority and former chairman of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, said the work will support improvements to the Mariposa Port of Entry completed in 2014.</p>
<p>“This project also leverages the investment made by the Mexican government to modernize Highway 15, the highway that connects Arizona to Mexico City,” Mr. Chamberlain said. “This is a major investment for Nogales and for Arizona. The future is bright for our community.”</p>
<p>Ames Construction and Horrocks Engineers are the contractors on the project, with Ames leading construction and Horrocks leading design.

<h3 id="us-starts-sending-asylum-seekers-across-arizona-border">&ldquo;US starts sending asylum seekers across Arizona border&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
Now, asylum-seekers will have to find their own way through dangerous Mexican border roads.</p>
<p>About 30 asylum seekers were sent to Nogales, Mexico, on Thursday, said Gilda Loureiro, director of the San Juan Bosco migrant shelter in Nogales, Sonora.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Loureiro said the migrants hadn’t made it to the shelter yet but that it was prepared and has a capacity of about 400.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“We’re going to take up to the capacity we have,” she said.</p>
<p>Critics say the Remain in Mexico program, one of several Trump administration policies that have all but ended asylum in the U.S., puts migrants who fled their home countries back into dangerous Mexican border towns where they are often kidnapped, robbed or extorted.</p>
<p>A Human Rights First report released in December documented at least 636 public reports of violence against asylum-seekers returned to Mexico including rape, kidnapping and torture. Human Rights First said that was a steep increase over October, when the group had identified 343 attacks, and noted the latest figure is surely an under-count because most crime victims don’t report.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The government calls the program Migrant Protection Protocols.</p>
<p>Nogales is now the seventh border crossing through which U.S. authorities returns migrants to Mexico to await court hearings. The policy was introduced in January 2018 in San Diego.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>More than 56,000 people were sent back to Mexico by the end of November, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. Of the more than 24,000 cases that have been decided, only 117, or less than 1%, have been granted asylum or some other form relief allowing them to stay in the United States.</p>
<p>But U.S. authorities have lauded the program, saying it’s helped to significantly reduce illegal border crossings. The Border Patrol apprehended just over 33,000 people along the Southwest border in November, compared to 144,000 in May, when border crossings peaked.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>In a statement, acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the program has been “an extremely effective tool.”</p>
<p>“I am confident in the program’s continued success in adjudicating meritorious cases quickly and preventing fraudulent claims,” Wolf wrote.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>A three-judge appeals court panel heard arguments Oct. 1 in San Francisco on a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union to block the policy. The court has yet to rule.</p>

<p>This story has been corrected to say Nogales is the seventh border city, not the eighth.</p>
