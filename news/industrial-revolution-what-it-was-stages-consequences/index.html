<p>John Bishop has been married to his wife Melanie since 1993 (Picture: Splash/Rex)</p>
<p>John Bishop is a comedian, presenter, actor and former footballer, having played for both Hyde FC and Southport FC.</p>
<p>He is best known for his roles on series such as Skins and John Bishop’s Britain – and for being vocal about the government’s actions in the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The actor is set to appear on tonight’s edition of Celebrity Gogglebox for Stand Up To Cancer, alongside The Who’s lead singer Roger Daltrey, in none other than Bob Geldolf’s own home.</p>
<p>The 53-year-old has been married to his wife Melanie since 1993, with the couple sharing three sons.</p>

<p>Visit our live blog for the latest updates Coronavirus news live</p>
<p>Before we see John in action on Gogglebox, where does he live with wife Melanie?</p>
<p>Where do John and his wife live?</p>
<p>John and his wife Melanie reside in Cheshire (Picture: Splash/Rex)</p>
<p>John and Melanie currently live in Northwich, Cheshire.</p>
<p>The town is about 18 miles east of Chester, and 19 miles south of Manchester.</p>
<p>In 2014, The Sunday Times notably named Northwich as one of the best places to live in the UK.</p>
<p>John and Emily also have three grown-up children together: Joe, 26, Luke, 24 and Daniel, 22.</p>
<p>What did John say about coronavirus?</p>
<p>While John himself has not publicly disclosed that he has been diagnosed with or previously suffered from Covid-19, he has been quite vocal in his criticism towards the government’s handling of the pandemic.</p>
<p>In August, the actor had questioned the rules and restrictions put in place, suggesting many young people’s lives were being affected as a result.</p>
<p>Sharing a snap of him and sibling Carol travelling on a train while wearing face masks to Instagram, he wrote: ‘Travelling with my sister Carol… it’s incredible how the world has changed in six months.</p>
<p>‘Nobody is suggesting Covid-19 is not a significant problem but to change the way we all live and the damage it is doing to our young people, I honestly think we need to consider if the choices being made are the right ones.’</p>
<p>He continued: ‘It seems risk assessments were made months ago when we knew significantly less than we do now and nothing has changed despite the correlation between infection and illness shifting.</p>
<p>‘I am sure we will come out of it but I think that will happen sooner if we keep checking if that we are being asked to do makes sense.’</p>
<p>The next month, John later shared a video online in which he tried to make light of what he referred to as ‘confusing’ guidelines.</p>
<p>This was in response to the government introducing a rule of six people from more than one household being allowed to socialise together, as well as a 10pm curfew on pubs, bars and restaurants across England.</p>
<p>He said: ‘What I like about the fact that the government has now recognised that the virus is so clever, it knows whether you’re in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales, which is why we’ve all got different rules, cause that’s how clever it is.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>‘It also knows whether you’re working from home, or at work.</p>
<p>‘Because if you’re at work and there’s more than six of you in the building, then obviously the virus then goes, “They’re at work, let’s leave the lads alone. They’re busy.”</p>
<p>‘Then obviously, it’s okay if you’re at home provided that when your kid goes to school, they don’t bring anyone back because they can have like 30 kids in a class, but they can’t have six of them back to play in a park.’</p>

<p>Five new music shows have been announced:</p>
<p>On November 11, 2021, Jools Holland will bring his Rhythm &amp; Blues Orchestra featuring Ruby Turner, Louise Marshall and Gilson Lavis, to Stockton Globe, with special guest performances from Squeeze’s Chris Difford and Lulu, who last performed on the iconic stage back in 1966 supporting Roy Orbison.</p>

<p>On October 12, 2021, The Waterboys will light up Stockton Globe’s stage with a line up featuring established core members Mike Scott, Steve Wickham, Paul Brown, Ralph Salmins and Aongus Ralston.</p>

<p>The first five comedy acts with shows on sale for 2021 have also been announced:</p>

<p>South Shields critically acclaimed comedian and hilarious household name Chris Ramsey will be bringing his high energy, life affirming, trademark stand-up to Stockton on October 29, 2021 as part of his Chris Ramsey 20/20 tour.</p>
<p>Comedy superstar John Bishop will play two nights at the Stockton Globe, on November 26 and 27, as part of his brand-new, highly anticipated World Tour, Right Here, Right Now.</p>

<p>Stockton Globe is also welcoming two dance shows in 2021.</p>

<p>Already announced and on sale, Diversity will bring the ‘Connected’ tour created by the talented Ashley Banjo, to Stockton on June 2, 2021.</p>
<p>This show will take them into a new decade of Diversity, and centres around the world of social media, the internet, and the digital era we now live in, but more importantly how this connects us all.</p>
<p>The historic 3000 plus capacity North East venue, currently being restored to its former Art Deco glory, has been revealed via a flythrough CGI video, that showcases exactly how the stunning venue will look, highlighting features including the flexible standing and seated configuration, new purpose built bars, VIP areas, dressing room suites, orchestra pits and an additional 200 capacity gig venue and cafe bar, The Link.</p>
<p>The venue has been designed with a modern audience in mind, with customer and artist experience, a £1.8million technical infrastructure and digital ticketing system.</p>
<p>Re-opening in 2021, after more than 45 years since the last live performance, the Stockton Globe is set to be a huge asset for the Borough’s economy, attracting up to 200,000 visitors per year and bringing millions of pounds into the local economy each year.</p>
<p>Its restoration is key to the development of Stockton High Street and will create the biggest live entertainment venue between Newcastle and Leeds, right at the heart of the Tees Valley.</p>
<p>Its restoration has been led and funded by Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council with support from a £4.5million National Lottery grant through The National Lottery Heritage Fund’s Heritage Enterprise scheme.</p>
<p>The Stockton Globe is due to complete in April 2021 and will be run by the world’s leading operator of live entertainment venues, Ambassador Theatre Group (ATG).</p>
<p>Councillor Jim Beall, Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council’s Cabinet Member for Health, Leisure and Culture, said: “The calibre of these acts speak for themselves and I have no doubt that these shows going on sale following on from the Paloma Faith and Diversity announcements will be starting to get people from near and far very excited for the Globe’s reopening next year.</p>
<p>“It’s an eclectic mix of entertainment on offer and it demonstrates just how well-suited the venue is to a wide range of performances. The momentum is building quickly as more of next year’s programme gets announced and I’d encourage everyone to get signed up to the mailing list so they can avoid disappointment!”</p>
<p>General Manager, Jo Ager said: “We’re ecstatic to reveal the amazing names that we are bringing to Stockton Globe when we re-open next year. The people of Stockton know the history of the venue, but what we have planned for the future will make everyone, everywhere, sit up and take notice.</p>
<p>“This is the start of something really special; as we move forward, we will continue to focus on music, comedy and family-based performances and bringing the best in the business to our stage.”

<h3 id="why-is-gogglebox-featuring-celebrities-tonight-and-how-can-they-film-together">&ldquo;Why is Gogglebox featuring celebrities tonight and how can they film together?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article19155928.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Celebrity-Gogglebox-For-SU2C.jpg" alt="img">
If you&rsquo;re a fan of Gogglebox and tuning in tonight, you may notice something different.</p>
<p>There are some familiar faces from elsewhere in the entertainment world joining our favourite families - but for one night only.</p>
<p>Line of Duty&rsquo;s Adrian Dunbar, Vicky McClure and Martin Compston and comedian John Bishop and The Who star Rodger Daltrey will be among the stars popping up throughout the show.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be in addition to the views of our usual telly critics including best pals Jenny and Lee, Blackpool sibling duo Pete and Sophie, and the Siddiquis.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s all for a good cause.</p>
<p>Tonight&rsquo;s Gogglebox is a celebrity special for Stand Up to Cancer, the joint fundraising initiative between Channel 4 and Cancer Research UK.</p>
<p>Since launching in 2012, more than £62 million has been raised in the UK which has funded 52 clinical trials and projects involving 11,000 cancer patients across the country.</p>
<p>Gogglebox will be followed by a special version of The Last Leg which will see host Adam Hills having a prostate exam live on TV to to encourage more men to be checked for prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Back to Gogglebox, you may be wondering how the celebrities can film together with all the restrictions in place.</p>
<p>All programmes currently being filmed are following industry specific, Covid-secure guidelines.</p>
<p>Some of the stars will be social distancing but it&rsquo;s likely others are currently able to be closer due to filming commitments on other shows.</p>
<p>And Channel 4 have previously explained how they were still able to film during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>A spokesperson also said in relation to the earlier series: &ldquo;Most of the families live together but where they don&rsquo;t, they are complying with PHE [Public Health England] social distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gogglebox will only film with families where it&rsquo;s safe to do so. The health and safety of our cast and crew is paramount.&rdquo;

<h3 id="is-great-whale-rescue-presenter-john-bishop-married">&ldquo;Is &lsquo;Great Whale Rescue&rsquo; presenter John Bishop married?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2020/10/14/3e0c68b2-d256-4f10-b846-4daeffe7e274-john_bishops_great_whale_rescue_07.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;fm=jpg" alt="img">
Comedian John Bishop has stolen hearts of the nation with his new documentary series for ITV, John Bishop&rsquo;s Great Whale Rescue. The show first aired on Oct.12 and tells the heartwarming – and at times heartbreaking – story of two beluga whales being released from captivity and into an ocean sanctuary. But what inspired the comedian to don a wetsuit in the first place? And more importantly, is John Bishop married?</p>
<p>The award-winning stand-up comedian, who hails from Liverpool, is also a stand-up husband and dad. He lives in Cheshire with his wife, Melanie, and rescued potbellied pig Lucky, and three dogs. The Bishops also have three sons, Joe, 26, Luke, 24 and Daniel, 22.</p>
<p>John and Melanie married back in 1993 and celebrated their 27th wedding anniversary back in March 2020. To mark the occasion, Bishop shared the sweetest Instagram posts, which included a video clip of Melanie wearing her wedding dress, twirling in the garden, and a rather adorable message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;27 years ago today when the world was a different place I married @melbish1,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Every year she gets into the wedding dress and spins in the garden and every year I get a little bit fatter and wonder where the years went. It’s been a hell of a journey and I can’t imagine I could have done with anyone else.&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m not crying, you&rsquo;re crying.)</p>
<p>But their relationship wasn&rsquo;t always so solid. The couple in fact broke up for a brief time. Speaking on the The Jonathan Ross Show in 2014, Bishop recounted how his and Melanie&rsquo;s marriage broke down: “There was no huge fight or revelation about someone else,” said the Scouse comic. “We just grew apart. Maybe it had something to do with having three kids so quickly. For six years there was always someone in the house in nappies. Our marriage just faded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After divorcing and establishing separate lives, but remaining close by for the sake of the boys, Bishop found himself telling jokes at a local comedy club called the Frog and Bucket. Their flame was &ldquo;eventually reignited&rdquo;, as per The Mirror, in the strangest of ways. About 18 months after splitting, Melanie visited the Frog and Bucket to find her estranged husband on stage and telling jokes about killing her and keeping her head in the fridge because “I knew I’d miss her”.</p>
<p>Family life aside, Bishop had a life-affirming experience filming his documentary with Beluga Whale Sanctuary and Sea Life Trust. The two-part documentary sees John&rsquo;s mission to return Little White and Little Grey from captivity in China to the Icelandic beluga. It&rsquo;s a 6000-mile journey, with a lot of difficult moments.</p>
<p>Great Whale Rescue has been very well-received with many praising Bishop for all his input during the expedition.</p>
<p>Praise also came from actor Lisa Jane Riley who tweeted: &lsquo;I’ve been looking forward to @itv GREAT WHALE RESCUE all day @JohnBishop100 it’s just beautiful. The love and connection growing. Seeing them embark on a journey to freedom and years in free water#whalerescue stunning beyond words. “Little Grey” &amp; “Little White&rsquo;</p>
<p>Following the final episode which aired on Oct.13, Bishop shared that the Great Whale Rescue was &ldquo;one of the best experiences&rdquo; of his life.
