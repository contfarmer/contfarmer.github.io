<p>(RNS) — It has only been four days since the release of Bob Dylan&rsquo;s first album of original songs in eight years — &ldquo;Rough and Rowdy Ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In those few days, several of its songs — most notably, &ldquo;I Contain Multitudes&rdquo; and &quot; Mother of Muses&rdquo; — have become ear worms. They have taken up permanent residence within my brain.</p>
<p>That is how good Dylan&rsquo;s 39th studio album is. It appeared right after his 79th birthday.</p>
<p>I shall let certified Dylanologists analyze the lyrics on the new Dylan album with the appropriate depth.</p>
<p>I have only one question :What religion is Dylan, now?</p>
<p>Speaking of his life decades ago, Dylan said: &ldquo;My past is so complicated you wouldn&rsquo;t believe it, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not really. He was Robert Zimmerman, born in Duluth, Minnesota, and spent his childhood in Hibbing, Minnesota.</p>
<p>Bobby Zimmerman became bar mitzvah in Hibbing&rsquo;s small shul. His father, Abe, was the president of the local B&rsquo;nai B&rsquo;rith lodge. His mother, Beatty, was the president of the local Hadassah chapter. He attended Camp Herzl. At the University of Minnesota, he was a member of Sigma Alpha Mu, a nominally Jewish fraternity.</p>
<p>At certain points in his life, he all but denied being Jewish — pretending to be Woody Guthrie; saying that he had been an itinerant blues singer.</p>
<p>But, dos pintele yid, that Jewish spark, just kept on coming back, even if he claimed &ldquo;Talkin&rsquo; Havah Nagilah Blues,&rdquo; was a &ldquo;foreign song I learned in Utah.&rdquo; He recorded numerous songs with Jewish references and biblical motifs — all of which have been analyzed beyond imagination.</p>
<p>Dylan embraced evangelical Christianity, recording several albums of songs with Christian-influenced lyrics.</p>
<p>He returned to Judaism. Check out this video of Dylan, his son-in-law, musician and observant Jew, Peter Himmelman , and the late Harry Dean Stanton at a Chabad telethon! He visited Israel on several occasions. He recorded &ldquo;Neighborhood Bully,&rdquo; rock music&rsquo;s most Zionist song.</p>
<p>So, yes: for someone whose religious identity has been &ldquo;like a rolling stone,&rdquo; it is fair to listen to the new album, and ask: What religion is Dylan, now? Is Dylan, once again, a Christian?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gon&rsquo; make you play the piano like Leon Russell Like Liberace, like St. John the Apostle I&rsquo;ll play every number that I can play I&rsquo;ll see you maybe on Judgment Day After midnight, if you still wanna meet I&rsquo;ll be in Black Horse Tavern on Armageddon Street Two doors down, not that far a walk I&rsquo;ll hear your footsteps, you won&rsquo;t have to knock I&rsquo;ll bring someone to life, balance the scales I&rsquo;m not gonna get involved in any insignificant details&hellip; You can bring it to St. Peter You can bring it to Jerome You can bring it all the way over Bring it all the way home.</p>
<p>True: Leon Russell played a mean piano. So did Liberace.</p>
<p>But, Saint John the Apostle? Unless Dylan needed a rhyme for Russell? Judgement Day — clearly Christian.</p>
<p>Or, &quot; I&rsquo;ve Made Up My Mind To Give Myself To You.” If I had the wings of a snow white dove I&rsquo;d preach the gospel, the gospel of love A love so real, a love so true I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to give myself to you.</p>
<p>And finally, &ldquo;Goodbye Jimmy Reed,&rdquo; which refers to the influential American blues musician and songwriter.</p>
<p>I live on a street named after a saint Women in the churches wear powder and paint Where the Jews, and Catholics, and the Muslims all pray I can tell they&rsquo;re Proddie from a mile away Goodbye Jimmy Reed, Jimmy Reed indeed Give me that old time religion, it&rsquo;s just what I need. For thine is kingdom, the power and the glory Go tell it on the mountain, go tell the real story Tell it in that straightforward, puritanical tone In the mystic hours when a person&rsquo;s alone Goodbye Jimmy Reed, godspeed Thump on the Bible, proclaim a creed.</p>
<p>Is Dylan back to Christianity? Or, is he just using Christian images, as he had done so often even before his born again phase? Recall &quot; I Dreamed I Saw Saint Augustine&rdquo; : &hellip;With a blanket underneath his arm and a coat of solid gold. Searching for the very souls whom already have been sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That street &ldquo;where the Jews, and Catholics, and the Muslims all pray&rdquo; — is that a vision of a multi-faith America, or some point in the Old City in Jerusalem where such a prayer life would be possible?</p>
<p>Or, is Dylan flirting with ancient Greek religion? Consider the hymn-like &ldquo;Mother Of Muses:&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother of Muses sing for my heart Sing of a love too soon to depart Sing of the heroes who stood alone Whose names are engraved on tablets of stone Who struggled with pain so the world could go free Mother of Muses sing for me &hellip; Is &ldquo;Mother of Muses&rdquo; just an easier way of referring to Mary? Is she (oh, I am so going out on a limb here!) the Shechinah, the feminine presence of God?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, and as I said, let&rsquo;s leave the religious question to the &ldquo;professionals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Especially because when Dylan channels Walt Whitman in &ldquo;I Contain Multitudes,&rdquo; when he sings of all the identities that comprise him, who is among the ones that he cites? Along with Edgar Allan Poe, the Rolling Stones, Indiana Jones: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just like Anne Frank&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dylan sees himself as a Jewish teenage girl, hiding in an attic with her family from the Nazis.</p>
<p>When all is said and done (and all is probably not said and done), at the very root of his existence: Dylan is Bobby Zimmerman, and there is no piece of him that can forget it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a man of contradictions, I&rsquo;m a man of many moods. I contain multitudes&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no single popular artist — no, there is no single American cultural hero — who contains as many multitudes as does Bob Dylan.</p>
<p>Listen to the album. It will move you, profoundly — and, as is always the case with Dylan, it will make you think.

<h3 id="bob-dylan-sixties-folk-legend-shines-on-contemplative-new-album">&ldquo;Bob Dylan: sixties folk legend shines on contemplative new album&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thenational.ae/image/policy:1.1036081:1592809247/image.jpg?f=16x9&amp;q=0.6&amp;w=1200&amp;$p$f$q$w=70c86c9" alt="img">
For a musician who never stops touring, the coronavirus pandemic has had a drastic effect on Bob Dylan’s craft.</p>
<p>The folk stalwart had been on the road since June 1988 but was forced to cancel the 2020 leg of his tour in March.</p>
<p>But that virus-related setback hasn’t stopped him from releasing a new album this week. Rough and Rowdy Ways is Dylan’s first album of original songs since 2012.</p>
<p>The 79-year-old, whose real name is Robert Zimmerman – causing him to be known as “Zimbo” at school – is a workaholic. In a nearly 60-year music career, he has released 39 studio albums, 94 singles, 50 music videos, 12 live albums, as well as 19 compilation albums, 14 box sets and he has contributed to multiple film soundtracks.</p>
<p>Being unable to tour has allowed Dylan to once again reinvent himself, with some of his newer songs offering rare introspection. But some of them still show his passion for telling other people’s stories. The Sixties songwriter teased fans with the release of “Murder Most Foul” in March, the 17-minute ballad that became his first Billboard number one in 58 years of recording. That track, which follows the story of the assassination of US president John F Kennedy, rounds out Rough and Rowdy Ways.</p>
<p>On his latest release, his distinctive yet cracked voice barely follows a melody, but fans of Dylan’s work know that’s part of the charm and it allows his famously sharp lyricism to shine through. It is little surprise that he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016.</p>
<p>The album features the troubadour’s hallmark mix of blues, rock ‘n roll and folk, with a little harmonica action in stomper “Goodbye Jimmy Reed”, a tribute to the electric blues man of the same name.</p>
<p>The lyrical content on Rough and Rowdy Ways has a broad remit – Dylan touches on history and politics, theology, philosophy, life and death – with some famous quotations and cultural references thrown in between.</p>
<p>On album opener “I Contain Multitudes”, the lyrics are dark but have a sly hint of black humour.</p>
<p>“I sing the songs of experience like William Blake. I have no apologies to make. Everything fluid, all at the same time. I live on a boulevard of crime,” he croons.</p>
<p>Later in the track, he sings: “I sail you down the river, I put a press on your head, what more can I tell ya? I sleep with life and death in the same bed.”</p>
<p>On the paean &ldquo;Mother of Muses&rdquo; he reflects more on history, saying that he could tell the stories of Elvis and Martin Luther King Jr all day.</p>
<p>But Dylan also reflects on what seems like his own situation. “Take me to the river, release your charms. Let me down a while in your sweet, loving arms. Wake me, shake me, free me from sin. Make me invisible, like the wind,” he sings.</p>
<p>As one of his best albums in decades, Rough and Rowdy Ways will surely withstand the test of time.

<h3 id="bob-dylans-new-album-will-stand-the-test-of-time">&ldquo;Bob Dylan&rsquo;s new album will stand the test of time&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9891893780573026%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_401%2C$y_27/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/09c8eed9aab32a5dbfef207112b98fe7f982db68" alt="img">
The mood of deep reflection was set in March by Murder Most Foul, the 17-minute ballad that became Dylan&rsquo;s first Billboard number one in 58 years of recording. &ldquo;What is the truth, and where did it go?&rdquo; he wondered in his paper-dry croon. &ldquo;Ask Oswald and Ruby, they oughta know.&rdquo; Bob Dylan has released his first album of new material in eight years. Credit:AP The song flashes back and forth in time through a hundred iconic references — the Beatles, Rhett Butler, Etta James, Shakespeare, Bugsy Siegel, Stevie Nicks — with the obscenity of JFK&rsquo;s assassination the grim centre that explains everything. For an artist who was two albums old at the time, maybe it does. Other songs on Rough and Rowdy Ways seem intent on a similar cataloguing of human wisdom and experience. The first two minutes of I Contain Multitudes reference Walt Whitman, Edgar Allen Poe, Mott the Hoople, Anne Frank, Indiana Jones, the Rolling Stones and William Blake. Mother of Muses recalls Montgomery and Patton; Elvis and Martin Luther King. False Prophet names Pacino, Brando, Liberace and several saints. Elsewhere lie Ginsberg and Kerouac, Hendrix and Satchmo, Jimmy Reed and Harry Truman. &ldquo;If you want to remember,&rdquo; Dylan sings in Murder Most Foul, &ldquo;you better write down the names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thread of accumulated history is reflected in the music, which has long transcended folk and rock to draw on the vast palette of American music. Since his last original album of 2012, Tempest, Dylan and his longstanding band have released five CDs of classic American songbook covers. Rough and Rowdy Ways was released on Friday, June 19. Credit:Columbia That&rsquo;s the basis of the folk tradition, of course: respectful accumulation of the wisdom and materials of the past, perpetually reinterpreted by subsequent generations to tell a bigger story of who we are. &ldquo;I like to stay a part of that stuff that don&rsquo;t change,&rdquo; goes one classic Dylan quote from 1985. &ldquo;Our world is already obsolete,&rdquo; Dylan told The New York Times in his only interview for the new album so far. &ldquo;We have a tendency to live in the past, but that&rsquo;s only us. Youngsters don&rsquo;t have that tendency. They have no past, so all they know is what they see and hear, and they&rsquo;ll believe anything.&rdquo; The former Robert Zimmerman&rsquo;s reputation as an arch manipulator of truth has been legendary since he fabricated his backstory as a freight-train hobo in 1962. This time last year, he abetted Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s deceptively fictionalised documentary of his 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue, splitting fans into camps of outrage and delight.</p>
<p>Despite its litany of historic references, Rough and Rowdy Ways is no more cut-and-dried. Titles such as False Prophet, Black Rider and Key West (Philosophy Pirate) will have social media threads and late-night record clubbers combing for clues. Crossing the Rubicon might be read as another intimation of the artist&rsquo;s looming mortality. But even veiled autobiography has seldom been Dylan&rsquo;s style. &ldquo;I think about [death] in general terms, not in a personal way,&rdquo; he told The New York Times. &ldquo;I think about the death of the human race. The long strange trip of the naked ape. Not to be light on it, but everybody&rsquo;s life is so transient. Every human being, no matter how strong or mighty, is frail when it comes to death.&rdquo; Rough and Rowdy Ways continues the gravity-defying trajectory of Dylan&rsquo;s work during the past two decades to be considered among the finest albums of the creative renaissance that began with 1997&rsquo;s Time Out of Mind. In impeccably articulated style, sound and subject matter, it stands beside Love and Theft, Modern Times and Tempest in a new canon ripe for discovery in its own time, independent of past glories. Those Nobel naysayers of 2016 may choose to stick with their novelists, essayists, poets and playwrights, but this is how history gets written.

<p>It’s been eight years since 79 year old Robert Allen Zimmerman – better known as singer-songwriter Bob Dylan – came out with an original album. But that’s just what he’ll do this Friday, when ‘Rough and Rowdy Ways’ hits store shelves.</p>
<p>Word on the street is that it’s pretty good, too. On June 13, Neil McCormick in The Telegraph awarded the album five stars out of five. Anne Margaret Daniel, reviewing for Hot Press, said “Rough and Rowdy Ways is a record we need right now, and it will endure.” Mikael Wood, in the Los Angeles Times, said that Rough and Rowdy Ways “rolls out one marvel after another.”</p>
<p>Rolling Stone went further, saying the album has “the bleak majesty of latter-day Dylan albums like Modern Times and Tempest, yet it goes beyond them, tapping even deeper into cosmic American mysteries.”</p>
<p>A trio of songs on the album have already been released as singles: “Murder Most Foul” on March 27; “I Contain Multitudes” on April 17; and “False Prophet” on May 8.</p>
<p>“Rough and Rowdy Ways,” Dylan’s 39th album, is “in some ways a nostalgic look back too,” noted ultimateclassicrock.com. “Its centerpiece, the sprawling, 17-minute closer “Murder Most Foul,” details the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy down to various conspiracy theories and its Dylanesque connection to Eagles, Fleetwood Mac and Woodstock. And it doesn’t stop there. The album is full of name checks, references and direct lines to 20th century cultural touchstones – from political and geographical talking points to life-long influences and his musical peers that helped shape the rock ‘n’ roll landscape in the ‘60s.”</p>
<p>In a thoughtful interview with the New York Times, Dylan was asked whether he viewed the COVID-19 pandemic in biblical terms. He said, “I think it’s a forerunner of something else to come. It’s an invasion for sure, and it’s widespread, but biblical? You mean like some kind of warning sign for people to repent of their wrongdoings? That would imply that the world is in line for some sort of divine punishment. Extreme arrogance can have some disastrous penalties. Maybe we are on the eve of destruction. There are numerous ways you can think about this virus. I think you just have to let it run its course.”</p>
<p>Dylan, of course, has been a major figure in popular culture for more than 50 years. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs such as “Blowin’ in the Wind” and “The Times They Are a-Changin’” became anthems for the civil rights and anti-war movements. His lyrics during this period incorporated a range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defied pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture.

As Texas continues to see a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases and in the number of people hospitalized to fight the virus, Gov. Greg Abbott pleaded with Texans to take personal responsibility and follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to once again slow the spread of the disease and help the state prevent another shutdown. Do you intend to “mask up”?</p>
