<p>Owing to the rich porosity and uniform pore size, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offer substantial advantages over other materials for the precise and fast membrane separation. However, achieving ultrathin water-stable MOF membranes remains a great challenge. Here, we first report the successful exfoliation of two-dimensional (2D) monolayer aluminum tetra-(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin framework (termed Al-MOF) nanosheets. Ultrathin water-stable Al-MOF membranes are assembled by using the exfoliated nanosheets as building blocks. While achieving a water flux of up to 2.2 mol m −2 hour −1 bar −1 , the obtained 2D Al-MOF laminar membranes exhibit rejection rates of nearly 100% on investigated inorganic ions. The simulation results confirm that intrinsic nanopores of the Al-MOF nanosheets domain the ion/water separation, and the vertically aligned aperture channels are the main transport pathways for water molecules.</p>
<p>Here, we report the preparation of water-stable monolayer aluminum tetra-(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin framework (termed Al-MOF) nanosheets and demonstrate their excellence as building materials for membranes in ion separation from water. Exfoliated Al-MOF nanosheets exhibit a long-term structural robustness in aqueous environment and can form a laminar membrane via a facile vacuum filtration on porous substrates. The resulting 2D Al-MOF laminar membrane exhibits an extremely low permeability to tested ions (~3.3 × 10 −6 mol m −2 hour −1 bar −1 ) but achieves water fluxes of up to 2.2 mol m −2 hour −1 bar −1 . Overall, the 2D MOF membranes outperform the most reported 2D laminar membranes on the water/ion selectivity. In addition, the interlayer distance in the Al-MOF laminar membrane is self-locked via parallel π-π interactions, leading to a steady performance for more than 750 hours.</p>
<p>Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a scientifically compelling and evolving class of highly porous materials ( 17 ). Thus, MOFs are expected to be one of the most promising materials for separation membranes ( 18 , 19 ). In particular, the use of 2D MOF nanosheet-based membranes for gas separation holds the promise of making a breakthrough in achieving a simultaneous increase of both permeability and selectivity ( 20 ). However, it remains a daunting challenge to fabricate ultrathin MOF membranes (less than 100 nm) for water-related processing, since most reported MOF membranes are typically thick because of 3D crystal constitution and suffer from insufficient hydrolytic stability ( 21 , 22 ).</p>
<p>Ion separation with energy-efficient and environment-friendly membranes is essential in water environmental fields, e.g., wastewater recycling and seawater and brackish water desalination ( 1 ). Polymers are, by far, the most widespread membrane materials, largely owing to their easy processability and low cost ( 2 ). However, traditional polymeric membranes for ion separation from water are usually with a dense-selective layer, leading to the insurmountable permeability-selectivity trade-off, governed by the solution-diffusion model ( 3 ). In contrast, nanoporous membranes where nanopores act as the sieving role may overcome the limitation ( 4 , 5 ). In this regard, recent advances in nanoporous membranes, such as porous polymers, nanotube, zeolite, and aquaporin-based membranes, have witnessed substantial progress ( 6 – 8 ). The advancements collectively recognized the potential of nanoporous membranes in enhancing ion sieving capacity if the separation channels are properly designed. Nevertheless, most nanoporous membranes are usually thick at micrometer scale and are formed by discrete channels, hampering membrane permeability ( 9 , 10 ). Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene oxide (GO), reduced GO, MoS 2 , etc., have recently emerged as building blocks for membrane synthesis ( 11 – 13 ). These 2D nanosheets have constructed a new class of membranes with an ultrathin thickness, in which the interlayer space between adjacent nanosheets acts as selective nanochannels for ion sieving ( 14 ). Despite the thin architecture and special transport channels of these 2D laminar membranes, there are still deficiencies in separation performance, such as high transport tortuosity and insecure/improper interlayer distance ( 15 , 16 ).</p>
<p>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</p>
<p>Bulk-type Al-MOF crystals were obtained through a modified solvent-thermal method (23). The corresponding scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. 1A and fig. S1, A and B) show a layered crystalline structure. Considering the weak interlayer bonding in the [0k0] direction of the bulk-type Al-MOF crystals, a facile sonication approach was used to successfully exfoliate them into 2D nanosheets (Method section and fig. S1C). Impressively, the convenient exfoliation route can reach a high nanosheet yield of approximately 90% (fig. S1D). The 2D ultrathin morphology of exfoliated Al-MOF nanosheets is revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 1B and fig. S2A). More than 80% of the Al-MOF nanosheets have a lateral size between 200 nm and 2 μm (fig. S2B). After the exfoliation, the Al-MOF nanosheet suspension shows an excellent dispersibility, and the colloidal solution can be reserved for more than 2 months (fig. S2C). The thickness of Al-MOF nanosheets was measured by AFM to be around 1.9 nm (Fig. 1C), which is close to the theoretical height (~1.35 nm) of a monolayer Al-MOF nanosheet (Fig. 1D).</p>

<p>The crystallinity of Al-MOF nanosheets was examined by synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The crystal structures of Al-MOF crystals viewed down the [001] direction and the monolayer Al-MOF nanosheet viewed from the [010] direction are illustrated in Fig. 1 (D and E, respectively). The observed XRD pattern of exfoliated Al-MOF nanosheets fit well with the calculated patterns of monolayer Al-MOF nanosheets (Fig. 1F), confirming their inherent structural features of Al-MOF crystal. In addition, a selected-area electron diffraction pattern gives individual diffraction spots, demonstrating the single-crystal nature of the exfoliated Al-MOF nanosheets (fig. S3). Compared with Al-MOF bulks, XRD peaks of Al-MOF nanosheets are weak, and a few peaks even disappear (fig. S4), largely owing to the loss of diffraction signals in the out-of-plane direction and the nonplanar shape of the nanosheets (24). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), ultraviolet-visible spectra (UV-Vis), attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) characterizations in figs. S5 to S9 further reveal that the exfoliated nanosheets preserve the structural integrity.</p>
<p>Exfoliated Al-MOF nanosheets also feature a microporous structure (type I isotherm) and give a specific surface area of 602 m2 g−1 (fig. S10A). Meanwhile, it displays authentic angstrom-size pores from experimental isotherm analyses in Fig. 1G. However, the pore distribution plot of Al-MOF nanosheets shows a slight difference from that of its bulk counterpart, which could be caused by the exfoliation effect and inevitable restacking of dried nanosheets along the [0k0] direction (fig. S10B). To assess the water stability, Al-MOF nanosheets were soaked in water for a month. The water-treated Al-MOF nanosheets exhibited identical XRD patterns to their initial status (fig. S11). Furthermore, the N 2 adsorption-desorption isotherm and pore distribution of the Al-MOF nanosheets, after being immerged in water, were both similar to those of the pristine sample (fig. S12). Likewise, porphyrin ligand and Al3+ were not present in the filtrate after 1-month water stability test (fig. S13). These results confirm the unchanged crystallinity of Al-MOF nanosheets after prolonged immersion in water. In another aspect, Al-MOF nanosheets kept their characteristic diffraction peaks after being exchanged with NaCl (fig. S14A), which indicates that Al-MOF nanosheets could withstand exposure to inorganic ions, having a desired chemical endurance. In situ high-temperature synchrotron XRD characterization was also conducted on Al-MOF nanosheets from 50° to 190°C, and no obvious variations were observed on the phase transformations and crystalline lattices with the increase in temperature, which elucidates the pore rigidity in Al-MOF nanosheets (fig. S14, B to D).</p>
<p>A 2D Al-MOF laminar membrane (Fig. 2A) was assembled by vacuum filtration of a diluted Al-MOF nanosheet suspension (fig. S15) using anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) support with a pore size of 100 nm. In an apparent contrast to bare AAO support (Fig. 2B), a top-view SEM image of a ~10-nm-thick membrane shows a uniform coverage of Al-MOF nanosheets on the surface of AAO support, and no visible defects were observed (Fig. 2C). The continuous and flat Al-MOF laminar membrane was visualized by AFM and cross-sectional SEM characterizations (Fig. 2D and fig. S16). In addition, the membrane exhibits a hydrophilic character, demonstrated by a water contact angle of 44° (fig. S17). By controlling the loading of Al-MOF nanosheets, the thickness of the membranes can be precisely tuned from a few nanometers to micrometers (Fig. 2E and figs. S18 and S19). Notably, a typical homogeneous laminar structure is seen when the membrane thickness reaches 500 nm (Fig. 2E). The laminar structure was also revealed by a cross-sectional TEM characterization (Fig. 2F). Furthermore, the synchrotron grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) analysis observed a prominent (0k0) peak at 2θ = 7.6°, showing the d value of ~6.0 Å. This manifests that the slit width (h) is close to the size of the rectangular pore in one layer (δ = 6.1 Å; Fig. 2G and inset).</p>

(F) Cross-sectional TEM image of the 2D Al-MOF laminar membrane. (G) GIXRD pattern of the Al-MOF laminar membrane. The pattern was acquired from a thick membrane (~20 μm) due to the detection limit. The sharp (0k0) phase peak at 2θ = 7.6° indicates an average value of 6.0 Å.</p>
<p>The water permeation across the Al-MOF laminar membrane was first examined by measuring the weight loss of a container covered by a 100-nm-thick Al-MOF membrane (fig. S20). Figure 3A shows that the water evaporation rate of the sealed container is close to that of the open aperture (in the absence of the Al-MOF membrane). This demonstrates the unimpeded water vapor flow through the Al-MOF membrane. Afterward, we further investigated the permeation of the Al-MOF membrane for liquid water in a diffusion cell using deionized water and 0.5 M CoCl 2 as feed and draw solutions, respectively (fig. S21). The volume of the draw solution gradually increased with time, owing to water transport from the feed side driven by the osmotic pressure difference (Fig. 3B). The two experiments collectively show that the Al-MOF laminar membrane is permeable to water molecules. In the diffusion test, it is worth noting that the water permeance is dependent on the salt in the draw solutions. High water permeance was achieved by AlCl 3 and CoCl 2 solutions, whereas relatively low water permeance was achieved for NaCl, KCl, MgCl 2 , and CaCl 2 solutions (Fig. 3C). This anomalous result might be caused by the difference in the affinity of these cations onto Al-MOF sheets, which was verified by an adsorption experiment (fig. S22). Further XPS characterization shows that aluminum hydroxyl groups from Al-MOF nanosheets play a vital role in adsorbing these ions (fig. S23). Considering that the adsorbed ions suppress water transport to some extent, surface modification to inhibit adsorption of ions could be a strategy in future studies to improve the water permeance of the Al-MOF membranes.</p>

Inset is a schematic setup for the water evaporation process. (B) Liquid volume change of the draw solution with time during the diffusion process.

(C) Water flux through a 100-nm-thick Al-MOF membrane using different draw solutions (0.5 M) and the corresponding ion permeation rates. (D) Correlation between water flux and water/salt selectivity of Al-MOF membranes and other representative 2D laminar membranes on different supports. The detailed data are listed in table S1. Each set of symbols represents a different salt.</p>
<p>The permeation rates of these ions in the Al-MOF laminar membrane were also evaluated in the diffusion cell, using 0.5 M NaCl, KCl, MgCl 2 , CaCl 2 , AlCl 3 , and CoCl 2 , respectively. They are all ultralow, less than 3.3 × 10−6 mol m−2 hour−1 bar−1 (Fig. 3C), which is generally considered impermeable (nearly 100% rejection) (11). Compared with other reported 2D laminar membranes, the Al-MOF membrane has a lower ion permeance (table S1). After the diffusion testing using NaCl, the surface and underneath layers of the used membrane were characterized by XPS. Except for the membrane surface, NaCl was hardly detected inside the membrane (fig. S24). This further verifies the hindrance of Al-MOF pores on the hydrated salts. In addition, anion species have no apparent impact on salt permeation (fig. S25). Because of the affinity of some salts (NaCl, KCl, MgCl 2 , and CaCl 2 ) on Al-MOF active sites, the water permeance of Al-MOF laminar membranes is comparably low. Despite that, the water permeance of the Al-MOF membrane is still comparable to those of the state-of-the-art 2D laminar membranes when AlCl 3 and CoCl 2 are used as draw solutions (Fig. 3D). Notably, the water permeance of the Al-MOF membrane can be exponentially increased to 2.22 mol m−2 hour−1 bar−1 by reducing the thickness down to 20 nm, while high salt rejection remains (fig. S26). Owing to the ultralow salt permeation, the water/ion selectivity of the Al-MOF laminar membrane reaches up to 5.00 × 105 (Fig. 3D and table S1), which outperforms most 2D laminar membranes on different substrates reported so far.</p>
<p>The long-term integrity of the Al-MOF membrane was examined by assessing the Na+ permeation rate and water flux in a continuous testing. As shown in fig. S27, the steady plot of Na+ concentration at the feed side and a constant water flux of the membrane over 30 days were observed, confirming the long-lasting stability. The superior stability of Al-MOF membranes should be attributed to the locking effect of adjacent nanosheets by means of parallel π-π interaction (25, 26). Meanwhile, fig. S28 gives the unchanged reflection (0k0) peak at 2θ = 7.6° of the Al-MOF membrane after 1-month continuous testing. Furthermore, the antiswelling ability of Al-MOF membranes were visually examined (fig. S29). In addition to the AAO substrate, Al-MOF laminar membranes with similar performance were also successfully synthesized on low-cost polymer substrates such as polycarbonate and polyethersulfone (fig. S30).</p>
<p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to gain insights into salt rejection and water transport in the Al-MOF membrane. First, the kinetic behavior of water and ion transport across the pore aperture of Al-MOF membranes was simulated. In accordance with the experimental results, all examined ions are effectively blocked by the Al-MOF nanopores, whereas water molecules are allowed to penetrate on the basis of size exclusion (table S2 and fig. S31). Although both AA and AB stacking regimes are theoretically possible when Al-MOF nanosheets are assembled into membranes, density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that AB stacking is more likely than AA stacking due to a lower DFT energy (fig. S32). The DFT calculation also shows that the interlayer space of the Al-MOF laminar membrane formed via AB stacking is 6.1 Å, which is consistent with the GIXRD characterization (Fig. 2G and fig. S32). Therefore, on the basis of AB stacking, an MD model for the Al-MOF laminar membrane was built, which consists of two-layer Al-MOF nanosheets (Fig. 4), to compute the probability distribution of water molecules inside the membrane.</p>
<p>Fig. 4 Water transport behavior through Al-MOF membranes. (A) Crystalline illustration of Al-MOF membrane constructed with two-layer nanosheets under AB stacking sequence (viewed along the [010] direction). Dashed lines present two different incision positions for cross-sectional membrane geometries (marked with cut 1 and cut 2, respectively). Below figure is the corresponding water density map. The blue color corresponds to no water existence and the red corresponds to the maximum water density. (B) Linear water density profile collected from the upper water density map. White lines represent the water density in the three arranged pores (9.3 Å in the X axis × 3.7 Å in the Y axis), and red lines refer to that in the two arranged pores (3.7 Å in the X axis × 9.3 Å in the Y axis), as illustrated in white and red dashed rectangles, respectively. (C) Side view of the membrane at cut 1 section is viewed along the [001] direction, which gives the interlayer distance of 6.1 Å. Below figure is the corresponding water density map. (D) Side view of the membrane at cut 2 section is viewed along the [100] direction. White dashed rectangles stand for the low-water densities inside the interlayer space.</p>
<p>The water density map (Fig. 4A) reveals that the water flow is highly localized to the intrinsic pores of Al-MOF nanosheets. Furthermore, the corresponding linear gradient profile (Fig. 4B) indicates that water molecules align side by side when flowing through these pores (as illustrated in the water density map) due to confined space. The side views of water transport channels of the AB stacked membrane are presented by using two incision positions (Fig. 4, C and D). Most of the water molecules are observed in the straight channels (the vertically aligned intrinsic pores of neighboring Al-MOF nanosheets), whereas a small amount of water is in the interlayer spaces, as indicated with white dashed rectangles (Fig. 4, C and D). This is in agreement with the water trajectory results, which show that most water molecules flow through the Al-MOF membrane via the vertically aligned aperture channels (straight flow), and only 17.08% of water molecules shift from one channel to another via the interlayer space (shift flow) when passing through the membrane (fig. S33). Similar water dynamic behavior was observed in AA stacking model (fig. S34), although the shift flow is much more likely to occur because of the relatively larger interlayer spaces (6.2 and 12.5 Å). Furthermore, the MD simulations on NaCl diffusion reveal that salt species cannot permeate through the slit channels between the nanosheets in both AB and AA stacked membranes (fig. S35).

Abstract The Tibetan Plateau exerts a major influence on Asian climate, but its long-term environmental history remains largely unknown. We present a detailed record of vegetation and climate changes over the past 1.74 million years in a lake sediment core from the Zoige Basin, eastern Tibetan Plateau. Results show three intervals with different orbital- and millennial-scale features superimposed on a stepwise long-term cooling trend. The interval of 1.74–1.54 million years ago is characterized by an insolation-dominated mode with strong ~20,000-year cyclicity and quasi-absent millennial-scale signal. The interval of 1.54–0.62 million years ago represents a transitional insolation-ice mode marked by ~20,000- and ~40,000-year cycles, with superimposed millennial-scale oscillations. The past 620,000 years are characterized by an ice-driven mode with 100,000-year cyclicity and less frequent millennial-scale variability. A pronounced transition occurred 620,000 years ago, as glacial cycles intensified. These new findings reveal how the interaction of low-latitude insolation and high-latitude ice-volume forcing shaped the evolution of the Tibetan Plateau climate.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION The Tibetan Plateau has long been a focus of geoscientific studies because of its importance in global tectonics and Asian and global climate change across a wide range of time scales (1). However, with only few available paleoarchives of coarse resolution [&gt;8 thousand years (ka)] (2, 3), little is known about its environmental history through the Quaternary ice ages. To understand the mode and tempo of changes and, ultimately, the underlying drivers during this period, we need long-term high-resolution records from the elevated plateau with well-constrained chronologies. The Zoige Basin, occupied by a huge lake until the latest Pleistocene (3) and located on the eastern Tibetan Plateau within the South Asian monsoon zone (fig. S1), represents a potential site to fill this gap. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) at Zoige is ~600 to 650 mm, and the basin is primarily covered by alpine meadows, and the surrounding mountains have scattered forests up to ~4000 m above sea level (a.s.l.) (fig. S1). A sediment core extending over the past 0.9 million years (Ma) was previously recovered, but its analytical resolution and chronological reliability were insufficient to resolve orbital- and suborbital-scale changes (3).</p>
<p>CORE ACQUISITION AND CHRONOLOGY New drilling (33°58.163′N, 102°19.855′E, 3434 m a.s.l.) was undertaken in 2013 in the central basin guided by a seismic survey. A 573.39-m core (ZB13-C2) was obtained with 96% recovery, mostly consisting of fine-grained freshwater lacustrine sediments. Only the upper 50 m contains two episodic fluvial sandy layers, 10.11 and 10.4 m thick, respectively. Independent age control derived from magnetostratigraphy in combination with radiocarbon [accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)] and luminescence [optically stimulated luminescence (OSL)] dating provides an initial chronological framework (Materials and Methods; figs. S2 and S3), according to which the ZB13-C2 core extends back to 1.74 Ma before present (BP) (Materials and Methods; fig. S3). Fluctuations in arboreal pollen abundances (AP%) based on an initial age model using a combination of 14C, OSL, and paleomagnetic control points (table S3) show clear ~100-, 40-, and 20-ka cyclicities (fig. S3), suggesting possible eccentricity (E), tilt (T), and precession (P) powers. The presence of astronomical frequencies in the Zoige Basin record is further supported by spectral analyses of AP% in the depth domain, which indicate the occurrence of ~34-, 15-, and 7.5-m cycles, whose ratios are close to those of 100:40:21; the ~7.5-m cycle appears to be stronger in the lower ~75 m, while the ~34-m cycle is stronger in the top ~200 m (Materials and Methods and fig. S3). On this basis, a more detailed age model was constructed by tuning the AP% record to an ETP record that is generated by normalizing and averaging variations in eccentricity, tilt, and reversed precession (4). As this approach may artificially introduce astronomical frequencies in our record, we compared the ETP age model against an age model constructed by aligning the Zoige AP% to the Chinese speleothem δ18O calcite record, an independently dated (U-Th) archive of changes in Asian monsoon intensity over the past 640 ka (5). Comparison of the ETP- and speleothem-based age models of Zoige reveals a close correspondence (fig. S3).</p>
<p>CLIMATE PROXIES Pollen and sediment analyses (2787 and 3274 samples, respectively, with a mean sampling resolution of ~530 to 620 years), as well as x-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning (~6-year resolution) data, yield a detailed multiproxy record back to 1.74 Ma BP. The vegetation in the eastern Tibetan Plateau is strongly influenced by the Asian summer monsoon. A stronger monsoon with warmer and moister climate would cause an expansion of tree populations. However, in the alpine Zoige region, the density and elevational limits of forests are primarily controlled by temperature, as moisture availability is relatively plentiful (6, 7). This is confirmed by the distinct elevational distribution of modern vegetation (fig. S1), the good match of AP% and axis 1 of principal components analysis (PCA) on the pollen data (fig. S4), and the close relationship between summer temperature and PCA axis 1 in the significance test of the quantitative temperature reconstructions for core ZB13-C2 (fig. S4). Thus, on long time scales, variations in AP% in the core are mostly a reflection of changes in temperature, particularly summer temperature, but drought stress, for example, during weak monsoon or glacial intervals, would also have an impact on tree populations. Pollen-based quantitative reconstruction of past climate variables was undertaken (Materials and Methods), providing the first independent paleotemperature history for the Tibetan Plateau because of the dominant control of temperature on local vegetation (figs. S1 and S4) (6, 7). The mean temperature of the coldest month (MTCM) and precipitation reconstructions failed the relevant statistical significance test and are thus less reliable (Materials and Methods). Rubidium/strontium (Rb/Sr) ratios and carbonate content (Carb%) are used as supplementary proxies. Rb/Sr primarily reflects the chemical weathering intensity of the catchment or strength of summer monsoon and associated run-off (8). When weathering/run-off is stronger, there is greater Sr input into the lake, leading to a lower Rb/Sr ratio. However, Sr contained in carbonate can influence Rb/Sr ratios from bulk scanning data, rendering climate interpretations less reliable. We therefore measured Rb/Sr ratios on bulk samples after removing the carbonate content (Materials and Methods). This showed good agreement with the high-resolution XRF scanning data (fig. S5), supporting the view that the ZB13-C2 Rb/Sr signal derived from XRF scanning is largely independent of changes in carbonate content. Grain size changes could also distort the climate signal of Rb/Sr, but examination of core ZB13-C2 shows a weak correlation between Rb/Sr and grain size changes (fig. S5). The Zoige lake sediments are generally fine and have no large variations, except the two sandy layers near the top. The high correlation between Rb/Sr and the chemical index of alteration (CIA) at Zoige further support the weathering interpretation (fig. S5) that the proxies are sensitive to both summer precipitation and temperature conditions. Previous studies from core RH nearby ZB13-C2 suggest that carbonate content mainly represents authigenic chemical precipitation, as both detrital carbonate content and shell carbonate are in trace amounts (3). The measured Carb% in core ZB-C2 should mainly reflect processes of chemical precipitation in the lake, which are largely related to summer temperature and precipitation. High temperature could increase the precipitation of carbonate through changing the precipitation-dissolution equilibrium and photosynthesis process. Precipitation could also enhance carbonate content by washing more Ca2+ and HCO 3 − into the lake through chemical weathering. Carb% therefore indicates warm and wet climate. Carbonate content from core RH shows good positive correspondence with hydrogen index, a proxy of the effect of lake water depth (3). Our loss-on-ignition (LOI) measurements of surface mud samples, taken along water-depth transects from four lakes near ZB13-C2, also reveal that Carb% generally increases with water depth in each lake (fig. S5). High Carb% from core ZB13-C2 likely agrees with high lake level, which depends on the balance between precipitation and evaporation. The coherent variations in AP%, Rb/Sr, and Carb% (fig. S5), with low Rb/Sr and high Carb% corresponding to high AP%, therefore suggest that coupled changes of temperature and precipitation occurred over the past 1.74 Ma.</p>
<p>RESULTS Long-term vegetation and climate changes The Zoige Basin record reveals three major intervals with transitions at ~1.54 and ~0.62 Ma BP (Fig. 1). The interval of 1.74–1.54 Ma BP is marked by conifer and deciduous mixed forest (mostly Picea, along with Pinus, Betula, and Quercus) for interglacial times and steppe (dominated by Artemisia) for glacial times (Fig. 2). Interglacial biomes shift to conifer forest, and glacial biomes shift to meadow (dominated by Cyperaceae/steppe) in the 1.54–0.62 Ma BP interval with increasing steppe (mainly Poaceae and Ranunculaceae) at ~1.03 Ma BP. Over the past 0.62 Ma, forest expanded less frequently. A less prominent change is observed at ~0.41 Ma BP, after which Taraxacum-type and Poaceae percentages declined (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2 Pollen percentage diagram of major taxa and biome reconstruction from the Zoige Basin core ZB13-C2. (A) Pollen percentage diagram. Tree taxa mainly include Picea, Pinus, Betula, and deciduous Quercus. Major meadow/steppe taxa consist of Cyperaceae, Artemisia, other Asteraceae, Poaceae, and Ranunculaceae. The consistent presence of aquatic pollen of Myriophyllum suggests that the study site was occupied by a shallow-intermediate lake over the past 1.74 Ma. The pollen zonation is based on CONISS results aided by a multivariate regression tree analysis, which shows the biggest changes at 1.54 and 0.62 Ma BP. (B) Combined biome. The biomes were combined into five types. The results indicate a less frequent occurrence of forest from 0.62 Ma BP onward. Mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean temperature of the warmest month (MTWM) pollen-based reconstructions (Fig. 1) also show a stepwise cooling trend with the major transitions occurring at ~1.54, ~1.03, and ~0.62 Ma BP. Because winters at Zoige are extremely cold and dry with seasonal temperatures below 0°C, these signals would mainly reflect summer conditions and are, hence, mostly related to the summer monsoon circulation. The similarity between MAT and MTWM supports this interpretation. Rb/Sr shows a generally increasing trend with shifts at ~1.54 and 0.62 Ma BP (Fig. 1), suggesting the reduced precipitation associated with weakening summer monsoon. Carb% also indicates a reduced summer temperature and a decreasing lake-level trend. Although gradual filling of the basin by sediment may have contributed to the long-term changes in the lake environment, the similarity between the Carb%, Rb/Sr, and AP% records implies the presence of a long-term cooling and drying trend. Orbital cyclicity On orbital time scales, AP%, Rb/Sr, and Carb% all reveal ~100-, ~40-, and ~20-ka cycles with varying intensities through time (Fig. 3 and fig. S6), pointing to a link with astronomical frequencies (4). The 1.74–1.54 Ma BP interval is marked by an exceptionally strong ~20-ka cycle and a relatively weaker ~40-ka cycle. Weakening but still strong, ~20-ka along with ~40-ka signals are observed for the 1.54–0.62 Ma BP interval. The ~100-ka cycle appears at ~1.03 Ma BP and becomes established in the past ~0.62 Ma, along with an intermittent ~20-ka cycle and a weak 40-ka cycle. Sensitivity analyses, using the ETP age model and the age model based only on 14C and OSL dates, and magnetostratigraphy produce similar evolution in periodicities (fig. S3), underlining the robustness of these features at Zoige. Fig. 3 Continuous wavelet and spectral results of arboreal pollen (AP%) from the Zoige Basin core ZB13-C2. (A) The continuous wavelet and (B) the multitaper method spectral results for the intervals of 0–1.74, 0–0.62, 0.62–1.54, and 1.54–1.74 Ma BP. The data were resampled at equally spaced 0.6-ka intervals and detrended before analysis. AP% generally shows powers of ~40, 20, 10.6 to 9.6, 8, 6.6, 5.2, and 4.4 to 4.1 ka. Black lines denote the 90% confidence level. The ~100-ka cycle becomes established in the past ~0.62 Ma, along with an intermittent ~20-ka cycle and a weak ~40-ka cycle. Low-latitude summer insolation, dominated by ~20-ka periodicity, is commonly considered a main forcing of the Asian summer monsoon. High summer insolation enhances the summer monsoon through stronger continent-ocean thermal gradient that increases the atmospheric humidity and wind circulation intensity, or latitudinal oscillations of the intertropical convergence zone (9) via the associated meridional flow. A stronger summer monsoon brings more heat and moisture to the Tibetan Plateau, leading to warmer and moister summers. The ~20-ka cyclicity throughout the Zoige Basin record implies the strong influence of summer insolation via the summer monsoon on the climate and vegetation of the Tibetan Plateau. Because Early Pleistocene ice-volume changes were dominated by the ~40-ka cycle (10), the particularly strong and continuous ~20-ka cycle in the 1.74–1.54 Ma BP interval indicates the dominant influence of insolation versus ice-volume forcing. During the 1.54–0.62 Ma BP interval, the ~20-ka insolation cycle was still pervasive, but with the 40-ka glacial cycle becoming stronger. The first appearance (~1.03 Ma BP) and establishment (~0.62 Ma BP) of the ~100-ka cycle at Zoige are consistent with the rise of the ~100-ka glacial cycle (11). Studies have also highlighted the interaction of the westerly jet and the Asian monsoon system (12). Seasonally, the role of the latitude of the westerly jet relative to the Tibetan Plateau is critical in determining the stepwise transitions in East Asian rainfall seasons. At the glacial-interglacial scale, climate model studies suggest that changes to the westerly jet stream intensity and its position relative to the Tibetan Plateau might be closely coupled with the large-scale Asian monsoon changes (12). The presence of large ice sheets could lead to the strengthening of the westerly jet and its displacement south of Tibet, which, in turn, could prevent the penetration of monsoonal precipitation into East Asia, especially over the past ~0.62 Ma. The evolution in orbital spectral pattern at Zoige differs from that of other long-term records in Asia, including the loess-soil sequence in northern China (13–15) and the lower-latitude and low-elevation Heqing lacustrine record (8). Most of the loess records show only one major transition at ~0.9 to 0.7 Ma BP from ~40-ka (13, 14) to ~100-ka cycles and less prominent ~20-ka periodicity, perhaps a reflection that the loess records contain climate signals related to both Asian summer and winter monsoon circulations, while the Zoige climate signals are mainly related to the summer monsoon circulation. The pollen record from Heqing Basin shows a shift in the amplitude of Tsuga (hemlock) abundances after ~0.9 Ma BP, with larger interglacial expansions and major glacial contractions (8). Spectral analyses of the Tsuga record show strong 40-ka and 20-ka cycles during the interval of 1.82–0.9 Ma BP, with a rise in the 100-ka power after that. By comparison, the Heqing Indian summer monsoon (ISM) index (derived from combining total organic content and Rb/Sr records) shows a shift toward reduced amplitude changes after ~0.9 Ma BP, while spectral analyses show a shift from 40- and 20-ka cyclicity to 100- and 20-ka cyclicity at 0.9 Ma BP. Unlike the Tsuga record, the ISM index does not have a 40-ka spectral peak during the interval of 0.9–0.13 Ma BP but contains peaks at 73-, 55-, and 29-ka periods. An et al. (8) attributed the ISM changes to the interplay of the southern Mascarene high (influenced by Antarctic temperature) and the northern Indian low (influenced by ice volume). Zoige Basin located to the north of Heqing is less subject to cross-equatorial transfers of heat, which may account for the differences between the two records. The clear ~100-ka cycle in the past 0.62 Ma at Zoige also differs from the Chinese composite speleothem δ18O record (5) of the Asian Monsoon changes over the past 0.64 Ma; the cave records are obtained from South China and have an almost pure ~20-ka cyclicity. In summary, these divergences may arise from differences in the dominant mode of climate variability at the geographical locations of these records. Millennial-scale variability Superimposed on the long-term and orbital-scale changes are millennial-scale oscillations with frequencies centered at ~10 ka (10.6, 10.2, 9.6, and 8 ka) and ~5.5 ka (6.6, 5.2, and 4.4 ka) (Fig. 3). These signals are weak in the 1.74–1.54 Ma BP interval, but increase in frequency and amplitude in the 1.54–0.62 Ma BP interval, and decrease in frequency in the past 0.62 Ma. The amplitude of millennial-scale changes in the pollen record over the past ~0.62 Ma is subdued, but changes in the Rb/Sr and Carb% values (Fig. 1 and figs. S6 and S7) indicate that millennial-scale variability has been a permanent feature of the Tibetan Plateau climate since 1.54 Ma BP. Such temporal evolution of millennial features is not obvious in other long Asian records (8, 13, 14), perhaps as a result of geographical location and/or lower analytical resolution (~1.5 to 2 ka). The origin of suborbital climate variability in paleoclimate archives remains controversial and is linked either to millennial-scale freshwater discharges and disruptions of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) (11, 16) or to tropical insolation changes at half- (~10-ka) and quarter-precession (~5.5-ka) bands (17, 18). Although the Zoige Basin millennial signals exhibit cyclicities around these bands, their quasi-absence in the 1.74–1.54 Ma BP interval and the frequency/amplitude changes in the past 1.54 Ma do not support the link with tropical insolation, because insolation values have not substantially changed around 1.54 and 0.62 Ma BP. Half- and quarter-precession cyclicities are also detectable in Atlantic ice-rafting proxies (11), further suggesting that linking these signals in the geological record with tropical forcing is not always straightforward. A North Atlantic origin of millennial signals at Zoige is also supported by the strong similarity between the Rb/Sr and the North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP) ice δ18O (19) and Sanbao Cave δ18O records (5) during the last glacial (fig. S8).</p>
<p>DISCUSSION The Zoige Basin temperature reconstruction shows a long-term cooling trend over the past 1.74 Ma, starting with warm glacial and interglacial conditions and followed by cooling steps at ~1.54, ~1.03, and ~0.62 Ma BP. The overall cooling is in line with sea surface temperature (SST) reconstructions from the North Atlantic, equatorial Pacific, and Arabian Sea (Fig. 4 and fig. S9) (20, 21). Some of the SST records show declines after ~1.6 to 1.5 Ma BP, most show a prominent cooling during marine isotope stages (MIS) 24–22 (866 to 936 ka BP) (22), and none indicate a particularly distinctive change during MIS 16 (~676 to 621 ka BP). In contrast to most SST reconstructions, the Zoige shows much higher glacial temperatures before 1.54 Ma BP, perhaps a reflection of smaller ice sheets during that interval. In terms of ice volume changes, marine records (11, 23) indicate (i) a transition toward larger ice sheets and increased ice rafting from ~1.54 Ma BP; (ii) a prominent glaciation ~0.9 Ma BP; (iii) and the establishment of the 100-ka cycle, with growth of large ice sheets and the initiation of large iceberg discharges through the Hudson Strait from 0.64 Ma BP, in broad agreement with the long-term changes observed at Zoige Basin.

The dashed lines indicate the mean values of MTWM for three intervals. (I) Arboreal pollen percentages (~600-year resolution) from ZB13-C2. Black line shows the 9-point running mean. A secular decline in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations may have contributed to the observed long-term global cooling (24). This would have gradually raised the solar energy threshold required for a complete deglaciation starting ~1.5 Ma BP, leading to skipped insolation peaks after 1 Ma BP and longer glacials with larger ice sheets (25), although progressive regolith erosion and attendant changes in ice sheet dynamics may have also contributed to this change (26–28). Boron-based CO 2 reconstructions (Fig. 4) do not support a long-term decrease in pCO 2 , but a more abrupt change around 0.9 Ma BP, from consistently greater than 200 to ~180 parts per million (27, 29–31), although existing data are generally of low resolution. The 0.9 Ma BP decline in atmospheric CO 2 may be related to a weakening of AMOC during MIS 24–22 and increased deep-ocean carbon storage (32). On the other hand, a gradual increase in dust and iron flux from ~1.5 Ma BP in the subantarctic Southern Ocean (Fig. 4) suggests increased iron fertilization and possible CO 2 drawdown during over several glacial intervals (33). In addition, vertical carbon isotope gradients between the intermediate and deep Atlantic increased ~1.5 Ma BP, implying greater carbon storage in the deep ocean during glacials and attendant lowering of atmospheric CO 2 (11, 34). After 0.9 Ma BP, glacial atmospheric CO 2 concentrations reached relatively similar minima (29, 35, 36). With respect to millennial-scale variability, comparison of the Zoige Basin record with North Atlantic ice rafting history reveals parallel trajectories (Fig. 4 and fig. S7). Before ~1.54 Ma BP, Atlantic millennial ice rafting only occurred episodically with much limited intensity and spatial extent due to the smaller ice sheets (11). This is in line with the quasi-absence of millennial signals at Zoige during the 1.74–1.54 Ma BP interval. The 1.54 Ma BP boundary marks the emergence of millennial variability at Zoige with larger amplitudes and higher frequencies. It is correlative with a climate transition in the North Atlantic characterized by more active and permanently established millennial variability associated with more extensive ice sheets (11, 15). Another transition occurred during MIS 16 in the North Atlantic when Heinrich events were initiated (37). Since then, the intensity of millennial variability increased, but its frequency decreased (37), which can account for the less frequent millennial-scale changes at Zoige in the past 0.62 Ma BP. Last, it is worth noting that a major shift in the Zoige pollen record occurred at ~0.62 Ma BP, near the end of MIS 16, one of the largest Pleistocene glaciations, which included the most extensive ice advance in the southern Russian Plain (38). In addition to the change in the frequency of millennial-scale changes, the pollen record shows a shift to lower arboreal values during both glacials and interglacials, compared with pre–0.62 Ma BP levels. The glacial declines are in line with our understanding of increased glacial ice volumes from MIS 16 onward, but the reduced interglacial tree population expansions (mainly in Picea) in the Zoige Basin do not fit global trends (39). Uplift of the Tibetan Plateau at ~0.62 Ma BP could provide an alternative explanation for both the glacial and interglacial vegetation shifts by permanently reducing temperatures (40). However, the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau is dominated by strike-slip faulting with small rates of vertical motion (41), and plate convergence considerations and paleoaltimetry reconstructions indicate decreased and relatively constant uplift rates in the Quaternary (42–44). It is possible that the emergence of longer and more extreme glacials in the past ~0.62 Ma led to tree populations seeking refugial locations at increasingly lower elevations. Longer migrational distances could then account for their subdued expansions, with alpine meadows (as shown by the Cyperaceae curve) becoming more important around Zoige, not only during glacials but also during interglacials. The shift toward lower arboreal pollen percentages at ~0.62 Ma BP is paralleled by changes in carbonate content and Rb/Sr records (Fig. 1), although mainly in glacial values. Together, the data indicate a major environmental transition on the Tibetan Plateau toward cooler and drier summers, as global ice volumes increased.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS Changes in ocean circulation, carbon cycle, climate, and the cryosphere during the Early-Middle Pleistocene have led to the prolongation and intensification of glacial cycles. Pollen and sediment records from the Zoige Basin reveal the manifestation of these global changes in the eastern Tibetan Plateau as a stepwise cooling trend over the course of the past 1.74 Ma. More specifically, the evolution of the Tibetan Plateau climate and vegetation can be described by three successive modes with different combinations of low-latitude insolation forcing and high-latitude ice forcing (Fig. 5). The 1.74–1.54 Ma BP interval corresponds to an insolation-dominated mode, while the past 0.62 Ma correspond to an ice-driven mode. The 1.54–0.62 Ma BP interval represents a transitional insolation-ice mode. The relative impact of ice forcing versus insolation forcing increased in a stepwise manner, with a prominent transition occurring at ~0.62 Ma BP. The influence of North Atlantic millennial-scale variability was established from ~1.54 Ma BP. The interaction of these forcings shaped the expression of orbital- and millennial-scale climate variability on the Tibetan Plateau during the course of the Quaternary. While other long terrestrial records from China and marine SST records show a major transition in the mode and tempo of climate variability centered near 0.9 Ma BP, the Zoige Basin records indicate a major shift toward cooler conditions at ~0.62 Ma BP, coeval with the intensification of glacial cycles. Our records advance understanding of the spatial complexity of long-term environmental responses in monsoonal Asia and the pervasive influence of millennial-scale climate variability over the past 1.54 Ma.

<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS Study site description The Zoige Basin is a low-relief tectonic basin (32°10′-34°10′N, 101°45′-103°25′ E, ca. 3350 to 3450 m a.s.l.) on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The surrounding mountains exceed 4000 m in elevation. At present, the Yellow River flows into the western part of the basin. However, a huge lake occupied the basin during the Pleistocene, until it was finally drained about 30 to 40 ka ago when the Yellow River cut through the mountain barrier to the east (3). A new AMS 14C date on terrestrial plant macrofossils at 11.28 m (near the bottom of the upper fluvial sandy layer) from core ZB13-C2 constrains the timing of the eventual drying to younger than 28 ka ago at the coring site. MAT at the nearby Zoige meteorological station at the elevation of 3439 m a.s.l. (based on data from 1981 to 2010) is ca. 1.1°C, with July temperature of ca. 10.8°C and January temperature of ca. −10.2°C. MAP is about 650 mm. Most precipitation falls as rain during the summer months, owing to the influence of the Asian summer monsoon. The basin is primarily covered by alpine meadows dominated by Kobresia spp. and other Cyperaceae taxa. The surrounding mountains are covered by scattered forests up to ca. 4000 m a.s.l. (fig. S1), mainly composed of Picea asperata, Picea wilsonii, Picea purpurea, Abies faxoniana, Pinus densata, Betula platyphylla, and Quercus liaotungensis and by scrub dominated by Salix and Rhododendron (6, 7). The zone between ca. 4000 and 4400 m is occupied by alpine shrub meadow. Alpine periglacial desert occurs from ca. 4400 to 4600 m. The peaks above ca. 4600 m are covered by ice and snow. Temperature is the dominant climate control of the major vegetation types in this forest-alpine meadow ecotonal region (7). Seismic survey, drilling operation, and sediment lithology The seismic survey was conducted in the sedimentary center of the paleolake using Tromino 3G seismometers. Two 1-km transects along the north-south and west-east directions were surveyed, with 40 points along each transect. Another six locations within 3 km of this region were also investigated. The passive seismic data were analyzed using the spectral ratio of horizontal and vertical component data. The results indicate ca. 790 m (with 20% error range) of continuous sediments in this region. Scientific deep drilling in the sedimentary center of the paleolake of the Zoige Basin was performed in August to October 2013. A 573.39-m core (ZB13-C2: 33°58.163′N, 102°19.855′E, 3434 ± 4 m) was retrieved, with the recovery up to 96%. The depth was calibrated from the initial drilling after considering errors caused by sediment expansion in some sections, loss of samples, and drilling deviation. The polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes were cut into two halves, one-half for XRF scanning and laboratory analysis, and the other for archiving. The lithology of the sediment core mainly consists of clay, silt-clay, and clay-silt, except for two intervals of sand layers (fig. S2). In general, the sediments are dominated by fine bluish gray clay at depths of 573.39 to 490.52 m, and grayish green clays and silty clays with thin-bedded silt at 490.52 to 50.4 m and 40.29 to 11.28 m. Two sand layers occur at 50.4 to 40.29 m and 11.28 to 1.88 m. The top 1.88 m is dominated by brown-black silty clay, with soil at the surface that is disturbed by grazing. Mollusk shells indicating shallow water are found intermittently, except at the depths below 490.52 m and in the two sand layers. Dating methods AMS radiocarbon dating. Eleven samples of terrestrial macrofossils and one sample of bulk sediment from the top 20 m were picked for AMS 14C dating, following standard methods. Calibration was calculated using the database associated with the 2013 INTCAL program. The results are shown in table S1. OSL dating. OSL measurements of 11 levels of samples from the top 80 m were carried out using an automated Risø TL/OSL-DA-15 reader. Burial age was estimated by dividing the equivalent dose (D e ) by the environmental dose rate. All raw samples were first treated with 10% HCl and 20% H 2 O 2 to remove carbonate and organic matter. The samples were then sieved in water to pick out the grain size fraction of 63 to 90 μm. This grain fraction was separated by heavy liquids to obtain quartz using densities between 2.62 and 2.75 g/cm3 and K-feldspar using densities lower than 2.58 g/cm3. After drying, the quartz grains were treated with 40% hydrofluoric acid (HF) for 40 min to remove the outer layer irradiated by alpha particles and also to remove any remaining feldspars. The K-feldspar grains were treated with 10% HF for 40 min. All grains were then treated with 1 M HCl for 10 min to remove fluorides created during the HF etching. Laboratory irradiation was carried out using 90Sr/90Y sources mounted within the reader with a dose rate of 0.084 billion years (Ga)/s. D e determination was done adhering to both the post-IR (infrared) IRSL (IR-stimulated luminescence) (pIRIR) protocol (45) and the multiple elevated temperature (MET) stimulation (MET-pIRIR) protocol (46). K-feldspar is known to have two advantages over quartz for optical dating: The IRSL signal (per unit absorbed dose) is usually much brighter than the OSL signal from quartz, which leads to lower measurement errors, and the IRSL traps saturate at a much higher dose than the OSL does, making it possible to date older samples using K-feldspars. However, the routine dating of K-feldspars using the IRSL signal has been hampered by the phenomenon of “anomalous fading” (47), which gives rise to substantial underestimates of age. Recent progress in understanding anomalous fading of the IRSL signals in K-feldspar has raised the prospect of isolating a nonfading IRSL component for dating Quaternary deposits. A high-temperature (ca. 290°C) pIRIR signal, which is stimulated after a low-temperature (ca. 50°C) IRSL stimulation, exhibits a negligible anomalous fading rate. This has led to the development of pIRIR protocols (45) and also a MET stimulation (MET-pIRIR) protocol (46). The two protocols obtain almost the same results for samples younger than 80 ka, and the MET-pIRIR protocol can be applied to old Quaternary deposit events (&gt;100 ka). In this study, the quartz OSL traps are expected to be saturated, owing to the old ages of some samples (&gt;100 ka). We applied the pIRIR protocol to the samples younger than 80 ka to save laboratory time and applied the MET-pIRIR protocol to older samples. We also allowed for any residual dose at the time of sediment deposition, considering that pIRIR traps are less easily bleached than the “fast”-component OSL traps in quartz. The resulting MET-pIRIR ages should therefore be reliable estimates of the time of sediment deposition. To confirm that there is a negligible residual dose for our samples, we bleached five aliquots of sample #IOSL 2014-25 for a total of ~24 hours (~4 hours per day for six sunny days in June). The residual dose was then measured using the same MET-pIRIR procedure. The calculated residual dose for MET-pIRIR signals at 250°C is 17.40 ± 0.40 Ga, which is negligible compared to the D e values of 401.11 ± 0.49 Ga in this study. We therefore ignore the residual dose for all of the samples. At the simulation temperatures of 200° and 250°C, the D e values form a plateau, which indicates that the fading for the 200° and 250°C signals in the MET-pIRIR method has a negligible effect on D e estimates for our samples. Because the MET-pIRIR signals from K-feldspar have a much slower bleaching rate compared with the quartz OSL signal (46), all the K-feldspar D e values are consistent with a central value within 2σ on a radial plot, indicating that the measured K-feldspar grains were well bleached before burial. The radioactive elements of the U, Th, and K contents in sediments were determined by means of neutron activation analysis. All measurements were converted to beta and gamma dose rates according to the conversion factors of Adamiec and Aitken (48). The dose rate from cosmic rays was calculated on the basis of burial depth, latitude, longitude, and altitude of the samples. For the calculations of the internal dose rate of K-feldspar separates, a value of 13 ± 1% was chosen as the K content (49). All the dating results are shown in table S2. The dates at the depths of 35.5, 41.96, and 61.22 m are associated with minor reversals. However, Bayesian model shows that all the OSL dates, except the date at the depth of 58.06 m, which was dated as 39.25 ka BP and is obviously too young, are in order within their error ranges (fig. S3). The seemingly out-of-order dates would not cause a problem for the precision and accuracy of the age model for such a long record, although with some acceptable uncertainties as shown in the error range. There are two OSL dates (108.7 and 136.1 ka BP) to constrain the position of the Last Interglacial. Paleomagnetic measurements. A total of 3018 samples of 2-cm cubes were used for paleomagnetic measurements. Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) measurements was first performed using a KLY-4s Kappabridge (Agico Ltd., Brno). The susceptibility tensor for each sample was calculated from measurements in 15 positions using Jelínek’s (50) method. Most minimum susceptibility axes (K min ) of the AMS ellipsoid are close to the vertical, perpendicular to the bedding plane, whereas most maximum axes (K max ) are close to the horizontal, parallel to the bedding plane (fig. S2). The AMS results are typical for a primary sedimentary magnetic fabric, indicating that the Zoige sedimentary sequence has not been disturbed since deposition (51) and suitable for paleomagnetic analysis. Second, high-temperature magnetic susceptibilities were measured to identify the mineral type. The results show a major decrease in magnetic susceptibility at about 580°C, the Curie point of magnetite, suggesting that magnetite is the major contributor to the susceptibility (52). Hysteresis parameters, such as saturation magnetization (M s ), saturation remanence (M rs ), coercivity field (B c ), and the coercivity of remanence (B cr ), were also determined using a MicroMag 2900 Alternating Gradient Magnetometer to decide on the demagnetization approach. The results show that majority of the samples obtained &gt;95% of saturation remanence at ca. 300 mT, and the coercivity of remanence is generally low (ranging from 39.78 to 65.52 mT), suggesting that magnetite with low coercivity is the major component. The magnetic hysteresis loops are closed in the shape of the coarse waist type, also indicating that the mineral with low coercive force controls hysteresis behavior (fig. S2). The hysteresis ratios (M rs /M s versus B cr /B c ) show that the average magnetic grain size falls in the single-domain range. All these features reveal that alternating field (AF) demagnetization approach is more suitable for the Zoige samples. Remanence measurements were then made using a 2G-760 cryogenic superconducting magnetometer in the magnetic shielded space (&lt;300 nT). All 3018 samples were subjected to stepwise AF demagnetization up to 70 mT at 5-mT intervals. A total of 2350 samples gave reliable characteristic remanence (ChRM) directions. For the 668 samples whose AF results were not satisfactory, thermal demagnetization was further measured using a TD-4 thermal demagnetizer. They were stepwise heated to 620°C at 20° to 50°C increments. In general, both AF and thermal demagnetizations can remove viscous components of magnetization after 15 to 20 mT or 300°C, respectively. A total of 86% samples give stable and reliable ChRM directions (fig. S2). The magnetism stratigraphy results were then correlated with the geomagnetic polarity time scale (table S3 and fig. S2). A clear geomagnetic reversal (the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary) was identified at 272.26 m. The Jaramillo (343.28 to 364.52 m) and Cobb Mountain (390.43 to 398.01 m) subchrons were identified in the Matuyama chron. In addition, there are four possible excursions at the depths of 72.72 to 73.90, 176.19 to 176.49, 378.20 to 378.90, and 521.35 to 522.17 m, probably corresponding to the Blake, Emperor, Panaruu, and Gilsa events, respectively. These excursions could provide helpful information for our age model establishment discussed below, although they are not used as control points. Age-depth model establishment First-order tie points are provided by the AMS 14C, OSL, and magnetostratigraphic results (table S3), which were used in constructing an initial age model. The AP% record was then tuned using linear interpolation to the ETP record that is generated by normalizing and averaging variations in orbital eccentricity, tilt, and reversed precession from Laskar et al. (4). Three pieces of evidence support the robustness of ETP tuning chronology. First, wavelet analysis on the AP% using the untuned age model based on 14C, OSL, and magnetic reversal stratigraphy shows ~100-, 40-, and 20-ka cyclicities and their evolution over the past 1.74 Ma (fig. S3). Second, spectral analyses of the AP% in the depth domain show the presence of ~34-, 15-, and 7.5-m cycles (above 90% significance level) (fig. S3). The ratios of 34:15:7.5 (=4.5:2:1) for depth cycles are close to those of astronomical frequencies of 100:40:21 (=4.7:1.9:1). Examination of changes over three sections of the sequence (493 to 573.39, 216 to 493, and 0 to 216 m) reveals that the ~7.5-m cycle appears to be stronger in the lower ~75 m, while the ~34-m cycle appears to be stronger in the top ~200 m. Third, we aligned AP% to the Chinese speleothem record of the Sanbao, Hulu, and Dongge Caves for the past 640 ka, which has independent U-Th dating. Comparison of the ETP- and speleothem-based age models of Zoige reveals a close correspondence (Fig. 3). On the basis of the ETP tuning age, the four possible excursions of the Blake, Emperor, Panaruu, and Gilsa events are centered at 0.11, 0.49, 1.15, and 1.62 Ma, respectively, further supporting the robustness of the chronology. Laboratory analyses Rb/Sr ratio and CIA estimates. The Rb/Sr ratios were determined on core halves of ZB13-C2 using an XRF core scanner (ITRAX, Cox Ltd., Sweden), equipped with an Mo tube that was set to 30 kV and 30 mA. Scanning was performed at 2-mm resolution using an integration time of 10 s per measurement. To test the climate indication of Rb/Sr ratios retrieved from XRF scanning and the relationship between Rb/Sr and the CIA indicating weathering, we measured the elements (Al, K, Na, Ca, Rb, and Sr) of 481 bulk sediment samples on an Axios advanced wavelength-dispersive XRF spectrometer (WD-XRF; PANalytical, Ea Almelo, The Netherlands). Samples were first air dried and then ground and homogenized in an agate mortar. The carbonate fraction of the homogenized samples was removed using 2 M HCl and then rinsed thoroughly four times in deionized water and dried. Each 5-g sample was compacted into a disc of 32-mm diameter under 30 metric ton force for measurements. The CIA defined as the molecular ratio was calculated using the formula CIA = 100 × Al 2 O 3 /(Al 2 O 3 + Na 2 O + K 2 O + CaO). LOI measurements. Volumetric subsamples of ~2 cm3 of 3273 samples from core ZB13-C2 were used for LOI analysis. The samples were weighed and oven dried at 105°C to estimate moisture content. LOI at 500°C was then used to estimate organic matter content. The weight lost at 950°C was multiplied by 1.36 to derive the carbonate content (53). LOI measurements were also performed on the samples from the transects in the four lakes near the coring region to investigate the relationship between carbonate content and water depth on fig. S5. In the Zoige region, there are few deep lakes in the present day suitable for modern process study. The gradients of water depths of the selected shallow water lakes may be not large enough compared with the Zoige paleolake; however, they can provide parsimonious information about the general carbonate–water depth relationship. Pollen analysis. A total of 2787 pollen subsamples of ~2 to 8 cm3 in volume were taken at ca. 20-cm intervals. The subsamples were processed following standard procedures (54), including HCl, KOH, HF, heavy liquid flotation, and acetolysis treatments, as well as fine sieving to remove clay-sized particles. Known quantities of Lycopodium spores were added at the beginning of processing to estimate pollen concentrations. At least 300 to 500 terrestrial pollen grains were counted for each sample. The pollen percentages are calculated on the basis of the sum of the terrestrial pollen taxa. Aquatic/spore pollen percentages are calculated on the basis of the sum of terrestrial plus aquatic spores and pollen. TGViewer software was used for the calculation of percentages and for drawing initial diagrams. The zonation division was conducted using CONISS (55) with the aid of multivariate regression tree analysis. PCA, a multivariate numerical method for dimensionality reduction (ordination analysis), was performed on the pollen data to identify the major pattern of palynological changes. The dominant pollen taxa (with &gt;2% in at least one sample) were used in the PCA using the CANOCO program. Biome reconstruction Square root transformation was applied to the pollen percentage values to increase the importance of the minor pollen taxa before biomization. A modified scheme for China by Ni et al. (56) was used to assign taxa into plant functional types (PFTs) and assemblages to principal vegetation types (biomes) on the basis of the modern ecology, bioclimatic tolerance, and spatial distribution of pollen-producing plants. The biome score calculation was performed following the standard equation and reconstruction procedure by using the PPPBase software (57). The biome with the highest affinity score or the one defined by a smaller number of PFTs (when scores of several biomes are equal) was assigned for each pollen assemblage. The biomes were then combined into five types: forest, meadow, steppe, shrubland, and desert as shown in Fig. 2. Quantitative climate reconstruction A total of 5405 modern pollen samples from across China, where the percentages of all the taxa cover the range in the fossil pollen samples, were used as a reference or training dataset. Locally weighted weighted-average partial least squares (LWWAPLS) (58), a combination of the modern analogue technique and the transfer function approach, was used to derive quantitative climate reconstructions. This approach helps to minimize the problem of modern sample selection for traditional transfer function methods [e.g., weighted-average (WA) and weighted-average partial least squares (WAPLS)] and analog failure (e.g., too few or too many analogues) for the modern analogue technique. It is a novel and ideal approach for climate reconstructions at the broad glacial-interglacial scale when changes can be large (58). First, for each fossil sample, a “local” training set of analogs in the modern sample dataset was generated on the basis of the smallest squared-chord distance using the modern analogue technique. The results of leave-one-out cross-validation analysis show that the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) value of selecting 20 analogs is significantly lower than for 25, 30, or 50 analogues (table S4), while the represented climatic gradient does not decrease. Therefore, 20 modern analogs for each fossil sample are the optimal choice. In total, there are 597 samples in the analogue training set for all the fossil samples. The analog evaluation (fig. S4) suggests that all fossil samples have good analogs within the modern training set. To calculate the modern climate at the sampling sites of the analogue training set, we applied a thin plate spline regression approach to interpolate climate data from 756 stations across China from the China Meteorological Data website (data.cma.cn) using the open-source R software package Fields. Second, on the basis of the local analogue training set, WAPLS was used to reconstruct the climate variables: MAT, MTWM, MTCM, MAP, mean precipitation of the warmest month, and mean precipitation of the coldest month. Performance statistics for the WAPLS climate reconstructions are listed in table S5; however, the RMSEP can be misleading for a large heterogeneous dataset. Therefore, a significance test, which is increasingly being used, was performed to evaluate the statistical significance of the quantitative paleoclimate reconstructions. In this test, a number of reconstructions (e.g., 999) based on random variables are reconstructed using the pollen data from the training set. The proportion of variance explained by these random reconstructions is estimated using redundancy analysis. The results show that MTWM of ZB13-C2 explains &gt;95% of the variance of the random reconstructions, suggesting that it is statistically significant (fig. S4). In addition, MAT is the variable that is the closest to the test line. In this significance test, the summer temperature reconstructions are near the PCA axis 1 that agrees with AP%, indicating that they are highly correlated. All these results suggest that summer temperature reconstructions from ZB13-C2 are statistically significant. MTCM and all the precipitation reconstructions, however, fail to pass the test, suggesting that they are not reliable. Bootstrap sample-specific estimates of uncertainties for each reconstructed temperature value are shown in fig. S4. Note that the possible muted tree response due to migrational distances during the interglacials in the past ~0.62 Ma might have caused the underestimation of temperature range to some degree. Time series analysis Time series analysis was conducted using kSpectra software. Before the analysis, the data of AP%, MTWM, Carb%, and Rb/Sr ratio were resampled at equally spaced 0.6-ka intervals using AnalySeries. They were then detrended using singular spectrum analysis (SSA) in kSpectra. A window length of 300 was selected following the suggestion that the window length should be less than about one-fifth of the point number in the time series (59). Burg covariance estimation and heuristic significant tests were used for the SSA decomposition. The multitaper method was then applied to the detrended data, and spectral peaks were evaluated against a red noise background. To track the time-varying amplitude of orbital and suborbital periods, we calculated the continuous wavelet transform using the MATLAB code of Grinsted et al. (60). The statistical significance of wavelet power was tested relative to a red noise background power spectrum.</p>

<p><img src="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/18/F1.medium.gif" alt="img">
Solid-state quantum emitters with spin registers are promising platforms for quantum communication, yet few emit in the narrow telecom band necessary for low-loss fiber networks. Here, we create and isolate near-surface single vanadium dopants in silicon carbide (SiC) with stable and narrow emission in the O band, with brightness allowing cavity-free detection in a wafer-scale material. In vanadium ensembles, we characterize the complex d 1 orbital physics in all five available sites in 4H-SiC and 6H-SiC. The optical transitions are sensitive to mass shifts from local silicon and carbon isotopes, enabling optically resolved nuclear spin registers. Optically detected magnetic resonance in the ground and excited orbital states reveals a variety of hyperfine interactions with the vanadium nuclear spin and clock transitions for quantum memories. Last, we demonstrate coherent quantum control of the spin state. These results provide a path for telecom emitters in the solid state for quantum applications.</p>
<p>The k 1 site is assigned to the 6H-SiC β site on the basis of having the closest crystal configuration and properties to the 4H-SiC β site. k 2 is the most cubic-like site and therefore assigned to γ with the smallest GS1-GS2 splitting. The Debye-Waller (DW) factor is a coarse estimation as long-wavelength contributions cannot be observed (see fig. S1). τ is the optical lifetime. The spin parameters (absolute values for the diagonal components xx, yy, and zz) are given in their principal axis with g being the g-factor and A being the hyperfine interaction. xx and yy components are interchangeable, we cannot distinguish g xx from g yy , and a good fit is obtained when A xx and A yy are equal for GS2 and ES1. θ xx , θ yy , and θ zz are the angles between the principal and the c-axis basis. “-” indicates unresolved parameters.</p>
<p>In this work, we systematically investigate the optical and spin properties of V 4+ dopants in all five inequivalent sites of 4H-SiC and 6H-SiC. We present observations of single V emitters implanted into commercial wafers and confirm that their optical properties are stable and reproducible. In ensembles, we characterize the orbital structure through resonant excitation and observe a strong effect from the nearest-neighbor isotope environment ( 28 Si, 29 Si, 30 Si, 12 C, and 13 C) of the V dopant. We also obtain lifetime, Debye-Waller factor, and hole burning measurements to validate this system as an optical interface. We further present optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and obtain the anisotropic g-factors and hyperfine spin parameters for three of the orbital states, depending on the sites, revealing complex spin Hamiltonians with clock transitions ( 20 ). Last, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept coherent driving of the spin state. While some of the experiments are only shown on select sites for conciseness, the measured parameters are summarized in Table 1 for all sites with corresponding data available in the Supplementary Materials. Overall, these results reveal vanadium ions in SiC as prime candidates for telecom quantum networks.</p>
<p>Transition metal ions such as chromium in ruby have long been used in laser systems for their 3d shell optical transitions, often with emission in the near-infrared (NIR) ( 12 , 13 ). Recent studies using chromium, molybdenum, and vanadium in silicon carbide (SiC) have shown that they may be equally relevant for quantum applications, combining both brightness and (near-)telecom emission in a technologically mature material ( 14 – 16 ). Among these ions, vanadium V 4+ is the only fully telecom transition metal emitter, covering the entire O-band spectrum (1278 to 1388 nm), depending on its substitutional silicon site in the 4H and 6H polytypes of SiC ( 17 – 19 ). Although V has been studied for decades for compensating SiC crystals, critical questions remain regarding properties for quantum applications.</p>
<p>Quantum networks are rapidly emerging with key demonstrations realized using fiber optics and satellites ( 1 , 2 ). One of the fundamental challenges to practical quantum communication remains the ability to create efficient and scalable quantum repeaters that operate in the telecom range for low-loss fiber transmission. Solid-state solutions have involved advances in engineering, including frequency conversion and optical cavities ( 3 – 5 ), and the search for better optically active impurities with long spin memories ( 6 – 10 ). Current systems include vacancy-related defects for bright single-photon emission or rare-earth ions for telecom emission ( 4 , 11 ), yet few candidates have both properties.</p>
<p>RESULTS</p>
<p>Optical spectroscopy of defect ensembles Vanadium (51V isotope, ∼100% abundance) sits in the silicon site of SiC as a substitutional dopant (Fig. 1A). It is stable in different charge states including the V4+ charge state emitting around 1.3 μm and the V3+ acceptor charge state with an optical transition around 2 μm (21). The ground state of V4+ is located 1.6 eV above the valence band, about mid-level within the 3- to 3.2-eV bandgap of 4H-SiC and 6H-SiC (22). V4+ has a single electron (spin 1/ 2 ) in its d shell (3d1), resulting in a free-ion 2D state that splits into up to five orbital states, depending on the symmetry of the host lattice (17, 23). 4H-SiC has two inequivalent sites, one quasi-cubic (k) and one quasi-hexagonal (h), according to the nearest-neighbor atomic configuration. 6H-SiC has two quasi-cubic sites (k 1 and k 2 ) and one quasi-hexagonal site (h). A vanadium dopant in a cubic lattice has tetrahedral (T d ) symmetry with an orbital doublet ground state (2E) and triplet excited state (2T 2 ) separated by the crystal field, where the triplet excited state is further split into an orbital singlet (2A 1 ) and a doublet state (2E) owing to spin-orbit interactions, as shown in Fig. 1B. In a hexagonal lattice, the T d symmetry is further reduced to C 3v symmetry because of trigonal distortion that splits all the orbital doublet states. Because the local site symmetry is neither exactly cubic nor hexagonal, one may expect a mixture of these properties. This situation renders exact assignment of the V sites difficult and sometimes contradictory in literature (16, 24, 25). For generality, we use the unassigned site names of α and β in 4H-SiC and α, β, and γ in 6H-SiC; the question of site assignment will be further discussed along the experimental results. Similarly, the ground and excited states separated by the crystal field are labeled GS1 and GS2 and ES1, ES2, and ES3 for generality and are related to the Γ 4 and Γ 5,6 irreducible representations (17). Fig. 1 Optical spectroscopy of V4+ in 4H-SiC and 6H-SiC. (A) SiC lattices and their inequivalent sites for the V impurities. (B) Expected energy diagram of the orbital d1 states from crystal field theory and spin-orbit (S-O) coupling according to (17, 24). The quasi-cubic (k) sites mainly have a tetrahedral (T d ) symmetry, and the quasi-hexagonal (h) sites mainly have a C 3v symmetry due to additional trigonal distortion. (C) Resonant PL spectroscopy at 3.3 K (blue) and 15 K (red) for all the available sites. The different transitions are partially identified from the difference in thermal population of the orbital states. The assigned transitions for the 6H-SiC γ site are resolved in fig. S9. The weak sharp peak at the center of the 6H-SiC γ site spectrum is an artifact from weak transient laser side modes at this exact wavelength. arb. units, arbitrary units. (D) Resonant PL spectroscopy of the 6H-SiC β site at 3.3 K fitted according to an isotope model for the mass shift from neighbor 28Si, 29Si, 30Si, 12C, and 13C. (E) Optical lifetimes at 3.3 K after laser excitation of the GS1-ES1 transition for each available site. All error bars are 1 SD from experimental acquisition. We first characterize the V4+ orbital structure using resonant excitation of the ensemble optical transitions (Fig. 1C). A tunable laser is set on resonance with the optical transitions, exciting the electronic state, and the photoluminescence (PL) emission is collected as the system subsequently decays. The resonant laser is filtered out from the detection by only acquiring the phonon sideband contribution of the PL (see fig. S1). For 4H-SiC, we stabilize the V4+ charge state using a weak above-bandgap illumination (365 nm) to compensate for slow laser-induced ionization. This behavior is not observed in 6H-SiC. Our measurement confirms previous off-resonant studies (16, 17) and further resolves the transitions in much finer details. We first observe the similarity between the α sites of 4H-SiC and 6H-SiC by comparing their resonant spectra (and other properties in Table 1). This similarity is likely related to the quasi-identical crystal configuration of the h sites in both polytypes (Fig. 1A). The splitting between GS1 and GS2 is largest in the α sites (~500 GHz), resulting in substantial thermal polarization at 3.3 K compared to 15 K in Fig. 1C. For the 4H-SiC β and 6H-SiC γ sites, only two transitions are resolved with small ground-state splittings of about 10 to 40 GHz, making it challenging to assign these to specific states. We later solve this issue by looking at the ODMR signal from these transitions (see the “Spin properties” section) and find that the smallest ground-state splitting (16 GHz) belongs to the 6H-SiC γ site, consistent with the most cubic site k 2 . Last, only the 6H-SiC β site has six distinct optical transitions that enable the identification of all five orbital states (see Table 1). For all inequivalent sites, there are consistent features in the optical spectra that were previously unresolved with off-resonant excitation (17, 24). The resonant peaks are asymmetric with a longer tail toward higher energies (lower wavelengths) and are also duplicated at higher energies as shown in Fig. 1D for the 6H-SiC β site where this is the most visible. These duplicates cannot be from additional orbital states, which are already fully accounted for in some of the sites. The single-mode behavior of the tunable laser was confirmed with a Fabry-Perot to discard the possibility of an experimental effect. Following previous studies of donor-bound excitons in natural and isotopically purified silicon (26, 27), we attribute this asymmetry and duplicates to the presence of the minority isotopes of silicon (4.685% of 29Si and 3.092% of 30Si) and carbon (1.07% of 13C) in the nearest-neighbor sites to the vanadium impurity. When a neighbor has a minority isotope, there is a variation in the local mass from the dominant 28Si and 12C that shifts the optical transitions, possibly due to an effective local strain or change in the bandgap. For example, a single 30Si results in twice the shift from a single 29Si. Because there are 4 and 12 equivalent sites for carbon and silicon, respectively, even low abundance of minority isotopes results in significant probability of occurrence for a configuration different from only 28Si and 12C. The shape of the optical peaks is attributed to silicon isotopes, while the duplicate (larger shift) is from the carbon isotopes with larger mass shift ratio than silicon and closer distance to the vanadium. We model this effect using a multinomial distribution from the natural isotope abundances and nearest-neighbor site numbers (see section S1 and fig. S2). With only the intrinsic line shape of the subpeaks and frequency (wavelength) shift per change in atomic mass as free parameters, we are fully able to reproduce the spectra in Fig. 1D. We find an average shift for all sites of the optical transition frequency by 22(3) GHz u−1 or 10−4 u−1 for carbon and by 2.0(5) GHz u−1 or 10−5 u−1 for silicon. The fit also provides an intrinsic inhomogeneous linewidth of about 2 GHz that may be further reduced considering that it includes multiple transitions between the electron and nuclear spin states of ground and excited orbital states (see fig. S3). The observed isotope effect suggests that isotopically purified SiC materials may considerably narrow the lines and allow the spin states to be optically resolved. By contrast, quantum registers including both the vanadium nuclear spin and a nearest-neighbor carbon or silicon nuclear spin could be directly resolved optically, providing a competitive system for quantum algorithms such as error correction or entanglement distillation. Last, these shifts hint that the wave function of the impurity extends through the first few nearest-neighbor shells and that the optical transitions may be susceptible to static strain. The excited-state lifetime is an important parameter to estimate the brightness of a defect. Although previous measurements exist for V4+ (16), the resonant excitation here excludes possible decay pathways allowed by off-resonant light or possible mixtures of lifetimes from the multiple orbital states. In Fig. 1E, we characterize the ensemble excited-state lifetime by measuring the PL decay after a pulsed-laser excitation between GS1 and ES1. While the α sites have slower decays (108 and 167 ns) than the β and γ sites (11, 31, and 45 ns), the α sites appear brighter. This may be attributed to the α sites being more favorable during the material creation process and therefore more numerous [as seems to be the case with Mo dopants in the hexagonal site of 4H- and 6H-SiC (15)] or to higher quantum efficiency in these sites as suggested by density functional calculations in 4H-SiC (16). Overall, the lifetimes are much closer to that of vacancy-related defects in diamond and SiC [&lt;20 ns (28, 29)] than that of erbium dopants (∼ms), providing sufficient brightness to observe single V emitters without photonic enhancement. Last, the Debye-Waller factor, defined as the zero-phonon line contribution to the PL, is resolved for each site with resonant excitation as shown in fig. S1, with high values ranging between 25 and 50% (see Table 1), confirming the viability of vanadium as a telecom emitter of indistinguishable photons.</p>
<p>Single V centers The long lifetime of erbium ions has made observation of single telecom emitters extremely challenging without engineering. Previously, this involved either reducing the lifetime via the Purcell effect in an optical cavity (30) or by electrical readout via a coupled quantum dot (11). Although optical cavities are ultimately necessary for any quantum emitter used for efficient quantum communication, the ability to directly measure single defects using only free-space optics has provided alternative applications (e.g., quantum sensing) and ease of characterization in other systems such as the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond (9). More generally, the stability and reproducibility of single emitters are key challenges to address, notably, the requirement of low spectral diffusion of the optical transitions for entanglement applications (31, 32). We implant 51V into a 4H-SiC wafer with low defect concentration (no V compensation) and anneal to repair the lattice and incorporate the defects (see Materials and Methods for details). We were unable to obtain 6H-SiC wafers without background V for single-defect measurements. In Fig. 2A, we scan the surface of the sample while exciting the GS1-ES1 transition of the α site. Isolated bright spots corresponding to single or few V defects are observed, with PL intensity around 100 to 150 counts/s. The combination of low-power resonant excitation and longer-wavelength emission (long-pass filter at 1300 nm) provides a very low background signal limited by the dark counts of the detector (~20 counts/s). We confirm the single characteristic of one of the spots by autocorrelation g(2)(τ) measurement (Fig. 2B), which shows a clear dip below 0.5 near-zero delay (τ = 0). The intensity was obtained using a single-photon counter instead of a Hanbury Brown and Twiss configuration and cannot resolve below 20-ns delay; however, we obtain a g(2)(0) = 0.1(1) from fit using the relation g(2)(τ) = 1 − ae−τ/τ 1 + be−τ/τ 2 , where a and b are amplitude parameters and τ 1 and τ 2 are the short and long decay times, respectively. The short decay time τ 1 at 0.07(2) μs is reduced from the 0.17 μs optical lifetime (identical to ensemble) by optical Rabi driving. The autocorrelation also rises slightly above 1 (bunching) farther from τ = 0 and is attributed to a shelving state during optical pumping (with shelving time τ 2 ≈ 2 μs) (33). The measured single-defect photon count rate, combined with the lifetime, Debye-Waller factor, and optical collection efficiency, provides a lower-bound estimation on the quantum efficiency of the 4H-SiC α site at about 2%. This value may reach about 20% according to theoretical calculations (16) and could be further improved by Purcell enhancement in a photonic cavity. Fig. 2 Single V4+ α site emitters implanted in 4H-SiC. All experiments are at 3.3 K. (A) Spatial (near-surface) PL mapping of single and few V defects by resonant excitation at 1278.8 nm. (B) and (C) are obtained at the circled bright spot with spatial feedback to prevent drifting. (B) g(2) autocorrelation measurement obtained with a single detector with 20-ns deadtime and 10-ns resolution. The autocorrelation signal is normalized using its value at long delay time, and the dark count contribution is calculated and subtracted (~3% of total). The red line is the fit [g(2)(0) = 0.1(1)], and the red shadowed area is the 95% confidence interval. In the inset, the autocorrelation intensity is shown for longer times. (C) Resonant spectrum taken over 100 acquisitions for a total duration of 15 hours, with averaged intensity shown in the bottom. The spectrum shows two maxima from the slightly resolved electron spin states. (D) Resonant spectrum taken for a variety of likely single emitters [not confirmed with g(2)]. Their fitted linewidths (right) remain consistent at about 750-MHz full width at half maximum (FWHM). All the single-defect experiments are conducted at around 700 G to narrow the linewidth (high field limit). A weak 365-nm continuous illumination helps stabilize the PL from charge conversion (possibly from two-photon ionization). (C) and (D) are calibrated using a wavemeter with below 50-MHz accuracy. All error bars are 1 SD from experimental acquisition. We then characterize the spectral properties of the confirmed single V emitter. The implanted defects are relatively close to the surface with a calculated mean depth of ~100 nm, a configuration often necessary for photonic integration yet known to cause strong optical spectral diffusion (linewidth broadening) and blinking (PL intensity fluctuations) for other emitters (34). In Fig. 2C, we repeatedly measure the optical spectrum (GS1-ES1 transition) over the course of 15 hours. The spectrum does not shift, jump, broaden, or lose intensity during that time and has a linewidth of 750 MHz at full width at half maximum. The absence of spectral jumps over long time scales near surfaces may indicate that V does not have a strong electric field response. While the linewidth is orders of magnitude larger than the lifetime limit, it is likely broadened by the many unresolved electron and nuclear spin states (see fig. S3), in addition to the more typical inhomogeneous strain and spectral diffusion over short time scales. The optical stability is also consistent across various defects with linewidth varying by about ±100 MHz, as seen in Fig. 2D. The distribution of peak positions follows the measured inhomogeneous linewidth in ensembles (Fig. 1C). Overall, the optical properties of shallow, implanted single V4+ impurities in 4H-SiC appear to be mostly unperturbed compared to ensemble measurements, a crucial result for using these defects in photonic and other monolithic devices. The single-defect linewidth remains too broad to resolve the individual spin sublevels, although this may be enabled at higher magnetic fields.

<p><img src="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/10/eaaw8451/F1.large.jpg" alt="img">
Fucosylated glycoconjugates are involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. However, economical production of fucosylated drugs and prebiotic supplements has been hampered by the poor catalytic efficiency of fucosyltransferases. Here, we developed a fluorescence-activated cell sorting system that enables the ultrahigh-throughput screening (&gt;10 7 mutants/hour) of such enzymes and designed a companion strategy to assess the screening performance of the system. After three rounds of directed evolution, a mutant M32 of the α1,3-FucT from Helicobacter pylori was identified with 6- and 14-fold increases in catalytic efficiency (k cat /K m ) for the synthesis of Lewis x and 3′-fucosyllactose, respectively. The structure of the M32 mutant revealed that the S45F mutation generates a clamp-like structure that appears to improve binding of the galactopyranose ring of the acceptor substrate. Moreover, molecular dynamic simulations reveal that helix α5, is more mobile in the M32 mutant, possibly explaining its high fucosylation activity.</p>
<p>In this study, we designed and synthesized several fluorescently labeled substrate derivatives for fucosylation reactions. These fucosylation enzymes generate fluorescent oligosaccharide products that are readily retained in cells, thus facilitating development of a new FACS-based fucosylation enzyme directed evolution system. Moreover, we developed a competitive allele-specific TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to enable the rapid quantitative assessment of single-cell high-throughput screening efficiency; we are unaware of other instances in which this technology was used for enzyme screening. As a model, we used this new established FACS platform for the directed evolution of FutA and identified a range of improved mutants by three rounds of directed evolution. Our solution of the crystal structure of the best-performing mutant in complex with the donor substrate GDP-Fuc provided valuable insights into the mechanism through which fucosyl-transferring enzymes recognize their substrates.</p>
<p>In theory, any enzymes catalyzing a modification that interferes with recognition of transmembrane sugar transporters should be amenable to screening by similar high-throughput strategies. However, the only such attempts reported to date have targeted the C- 3 of the galactose moiety of the lactose(Galβ1,4Glc)/LacNAc(Galβ1,4GlcNAc), for example, use of α2,3-sialyltransferase ( 12 ) and β1,3-galactosyltransferase ( 14 ). Fucosylation enzymes can indeed modify LacNAc or lactose substrates at various positions. For example, an α1,3-FucT (FutA) can add a fucose to the C 3 -OH position of the GlcNAc group of the disaccharide LacNAc ( 15 – 17 ); an α1,2-FucT (FutC) catalyzes the fucose transfer to the C 2 -OH position of galactose ( 18 , 19 ), while an α-l-Fucosidase (FucD) can add the fucose to the C 3 -OH position of galactose ( 8 ). We reasoned that the galactoside transporter, LacY, could translocate a range of disaccharides or their analogs into Escherichia coli cells, and the fucosylated modifications by enzymes may well alter LacY recognition, making it possible to develop new screening methods for the engineering of these important enzymes.</p>
<p>Directed evolution has long been a key strategy to generate enzymes with desired properties (e.g., high catalytic activity) through consecutive rounds of diversification and selection ( 9 – 11 ). One of the crucial factors in directed evolution strategies is the development of suitable screening or selection techniques, which would considerably increase the chance of obtaining mutants with desired properties from large mutagenesis libraries and reduces the time and cost ( 12 ). Recently, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) has shown great promise for significantly advancing screening capabilities for glycosyltransferases (GTs) ( 12 – 14 ), and one of the important strategies involving FACS relies on the exquisite substrate specificity of lactose permeases (LacY) that are located in the cell membrane. The key to the screening method is to design appropriate fluorescent substrates that can be accessed by GTs inside the cell after transport by the LacY “gate” but for which the glycosylation products are not eligible for specific transmembrane transporter of sugars and are therefore accumulated within the cell ( 14 ).</p>
<p>( A ) Structures of various disease-associated and human milk oligosaccharides. ( B ) Schematic depiction of fucosylation reactions catalyzed by FucTs and fucosidases. Typically, an FutA catalyzes the l-fucose transfer from a GDP-Fuc donor substrate to a LacNAc acceptor substrate via an α1,3-linkage, forming the Le x . α-l-Fucosidases can also transfer a fucose moiety from the para-nitrophenyl α-l-fucopyranoside (Fuc-α-pNP) to lactose, forming a 3-fucosyllactose.</p>
<p>Fucosylation is often the final step in the biosynthesis of a number of oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates that are essential for a wide range of biological processes in eukaryotes, including angiogenesis, fertilization, cell adhesion, inflammation, and tumor metastasis ( 1 , 2 ). Given their bioactivity and utility, the synthesis of fucose-containing glycans such as cancer-related antigens ( 3 , 4 ) and human milk oligosaccharides ( 5 , 6 ) is of substantial applied interest ( Fig. 1A ). Natural fucosylation reactions are performed by fucosyltransferases (FucTs; Fig. 1B ), which catalyze the transfer of fucose from guanosine diphosphate β-l-fucose (GDP-Fuc) to various oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, or glycolipids. Furthermore, several retaining α-l-fucosidases are known to also have transfucosylation activity ( Fig. 1B ), and this has been exploited for the synthesis of fucose-containing glycans ( 7 , 8 ). Although both FucTs and fucosidases have been biochemically characterized in considerable detail, their broader applications in biotransformation or metabolic engineering has, to date, been hindered by the low catalytic activity of these enzymes. Thus, obtaining more efficient enzymes that are tailored for the synthesis of specific oligosaccharide and glycoconjugates would be of great scientific and industrial interest.</p>
<p>RESULTS</p>
<p>LacY substrate specificity for various fucosylated products To test whether the fucosylation modification can entrap enough fluorescent signal in the cell by affecting LacY substrate specificity, we chose FutA from Helicobacter pylori strain NCTC 11639 (GenBank accession number AAB81031.1) (15) for glycosyl modification. Since LacNAc is a natural substrate of FutA, we designed and synthesized fluorescently labeled derivatives of LacNAc: Compound 1 is the LacNAc conjugated with a bodipy fluorophore; compound 2 is the LacNAc conjugated with a coumarin fluorophore (Fig. 2A). These LacNAc derivatives with two chemically distinct fluorophores enable screening strategies that minimize the probability of selection for an altered dye-binding site rather than altered activity for an enzyme variant. Fig. 2 Scheme for the product entrapment strategy and the established cell-based fucosylation assay for FACS screening. (A) Two kinds of fluorescently labeled LacNAc derivatives (1 and 2) were designed and synthesized for cell entrapment analysis. (B) Fluorescently labeled acceptor substrates are transported into the cell via LacY; fucose enters into the cell via a fucosyl transporter (FucP) and was converted into GDP-fucose donor substrate by GDP-fucose synthase (FKP). After incubation and washing, E. coli cells expressing fucosylation enzymes accumulate fluorescent trisaccharide enzyme products, as the LacY transport rate for such products is significantly reduced compared to their disaccharide substrate form. Thus, the fluorescence intensity accumulation inside cells carries information about the catalytic activity of the fucosylation enzymes being assayed/screened. These cells with FutA activity can be further isolated using FACS. (C) Visualization of fluorescence entrapment within FutA(+) and FutA(−) cells under an ultraviolet light. (D) Flow cytometry profiles of FutA(+) and FutA(−) cell fluorescence after 30-min incubation with 1.5 mM fucose, 0.5 mM bodipy-LacNAc, and coumarin-LacNAc, followed by a washing step. Green and blue signals represent cells retaining bodipy and coumarin fluorescently labeled oligosaccharides, respectively. An E. coli strain JM107*, which has galactosidase (LacZ) knocked out (to avoid lactose hydrolysis) (12) but expresses a GDP-fucose synthetase (FKP), a bifunctional enzyme that has both fucokinase and fucose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase activities, was used to test the ability of cells to retain the fucosylated products. Theoretically, acceptor substrates are capable of entering and exiting a cell freely via the plasma membrane–localized LacY transporter, and once inside the cell, they should be subjected to fucosylation by corresponding enzymes to generate trisaccharide products. Given that these newly formed trisaccharide products are not substrates for the LacY transporter, which primarily transports disaccharides (20, 21), the new trisaccharides will be, in effect, entrapped inside of cells, thereby allowing unreacted substrates to be washed away without significant loss of fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2B). Pursuing this strategy, we incubated FutA-expressing cells FutA(+) and empty vector pUC18 control cells FutA(−) with fucose and fluorescently labeled 1 and 2. After several rounds of washing with LB medium and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer, we observed relatively strong fluorescence signals for the FutA(+) samples under ultraviolet light but not for the FutA(−) control (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, FACS analysis demonstrated that the cell expressing the recombinant enzyme FutA had stronger green (bodipy conjugates) and blue fluorescence (coumarin conjugates) signals than the control cell (Fig. 2D). In addition, to explore whether this trisaccharide product entrapment strategy can be more broadly applied to other fucosylation enzymes, including FutC from H. pylori (19) and FucD from Anaerolinea thermophila (22), we also synthesized diverse fluorescently labeled lactose derivatives as transfer acceptors (fig. S1A) and tested the fluorescence retaining capacity of cells expressing these two enzymes. As with FutA, these cells expressing the recombinant FutC or FucD enzyme had more intense fluorescence signals than did the empty vector control cells (fig. S1, C and D). These assays indicate that fluorescently labeled disaccharide acceptor substrates can be taken up into cells via the lactose permease LacY, but the fucosylation enzymes product, fluorescent trisaccharides, are transported much less efficiently, leading to product accumulation inside cells. Note that there are also other sugar transmembrane transporters in E. coli cells (23), i.e., sugar efflux pumps such as SetA, which is capable of transporting a range of sugars and sugar analogs (24). To address whether other transporters interfere with fluorescent fucosylation product entrapment, E. coli cells with empty vector control or the cells with plasmids for FutA, FutC, or FucD, were reacted with substrates, followed by washing with PBS buffer and with fresh M9 minimal medium. Given that we did not conduct LB medium wash, only the fluorescence outside the cell was washed away. These cells, which retained most of the fluorescently labeled di- and trisaccharide compounds (in some cases), were incubated in fresh M9 medium at 37°C for 30 min, and the fluorescence leakage in the culture supernatants was analyzed. We did observe some fluorescence leakage in the supernatants for all of the cell types; however, the intensity of the fluorescence leakage in the supernatant for the FutA, FutC, and FucD cells was only 15, 8.6, and 20.3%, respectively, as strong as the intensity for the control cells, indicating that the oligosaccharide products can indeed be entrapped efficiently inside cells (fig. S2A). There might be other transporters, which recognize and transport sugar products, but their efficiency is apparently much slower than that of LacY permease. Our results thereby established that cells expressing the fucosylation enzymes could retain their fluorescent trisaccharide products for a sufficiently long time to enable FACS-based screening following directed evolution targeted at improving fucosylation enzyme activity (fig. S2B). To boost the screening efficiency, we further optimized a series of parameters for the screening, including fluorescence signal stability, induction time, reaction time, and substrate concentration. The fluorescence signals of the FutA(+) cells were stable for more than 1 hour at room temperature, providing a more-than-ample window for FACS-based screening (fig. S3A). For the expression of recombinant fucosylation enzymes, we found that the cells induced expression at around 18 hours produced the strongest fluorescence signals, suggesting that the protein expression achieved by this point is highly amenable to these entrapment assays (fig. S3B). The fucosylation reaction was essentially linear within 1 hour while almost saturated at about 1.5 hours. To distinguish between positive and negative mutants in subsequent experiments, we therefore set the reaction time to 0.5 hours (fig. S3C). Last, we found that the optimal substrate concentrations for the screening system are 1.5 mM donor fucose and 0.5 mM acceptors (fig. S3D).</p>
<p>Evaluation of the FACS-based fucosylation activity screening system We next determined whether the cells expressing the recombinant fucosylation enzymes could be used with FACS. The first and most obvious test was to see whether FutA(+) cells could be sorted from FutA(−) control cells via the FACS system. Therefore, we analyzed FACS efficiency by preparing cell mixtures with 1:10, 1:100, 1:1000, and 1:10,000 FutA(+)/FutA(−) cell ratios. After a substrate incubation, the cells were harvested, washed, and analyzed via FACS; the top 0.5% of cells with the strongest fluorescence intensities were sorted to minimize possible false positives. To examine FACS enrichment efficiency, we plated the sorted cells and verified the presence of the FutA gene by colony PCR. Notably, a single round of high-stringency FACS sorting archived a population with 100% FutA(+) cells, even for the 1:10,000 mixture (table S1). Considering that previous direct evolution studies reported fold increases between 40 and 330 for a single round of FACS (25–27), this system showing &gt;10,000-fold enrichment ability highlights its extremely excellent performance. As this novel screening system is so efficient in identifying FutA(+) cells that it rapidly saturated the conventional enrichment test, we further developed a more stringent and quantitative approach to evaluating its enrichment performance. Instead of using completely inactive FutA(−) control cells, we adopted E. coli cells with markedly reduced FutA protein expression than normal FutA(+) cells to test FACS efficiency (Fig. 3A). We created the cells expressing FutA at a relatively low level with the robust ribosomal binding site (RBS)–ATG spacing technique. Briefly, the 13th base (cytosine) of the pUC18 plasmid polyclonal area, which is positioned at the back of the ribosome binding site, was deleted to generate the FutA(+)-RBS cells. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of cell extracts showed that the catalytic activity of enzyme in the FutA(+)-RBS cells decreased around three times in comparison with the normal FutA(+) cells. Compared with distinguishing between FutA(+) and completely inactive FutA(−), this high/low activity screening is obviously more relevant to a real directed evolution experiment. Fig. 3 Analysis of FACS-based screening efficiency by competitive allele-specific TaqMan PCR. (A) The RBS-ATG spacing technique was used to create two populations of cells: (i) normal FutA(+) cells and (ii) FutA(+) cells with a weakened FutA activity resulting from reduced FutA expression [FutA(+)-RBS cells]. Cell mixtures of FutA(+) and FutA(+)-RBS were prepared and applied to one round of FACS sorting. The unsorted and sorted variant pools were quantified using competitive allele-specific TaqMan PCR, and then, enrichment factors were calculated according to FutA(+) cell ratios before and after sorting. (B) Flow cytometric screening of FutA(+) and FutA(+)-RBS cells. (C) Percentage of FutA(+) cells increased after sorting. We prepared mixtures of FutA(+) and FutA(+)-RBS cells and performed one round of FACS (Fig. 3B). The enriched cell populations were plated and grown as colonies. We then used a technique named competitive allele-specific TaqMan PCR (with TaqMan probes) to distinguish between the FutA(+) and FutA(+)-RBS colonies (exploiting the aforementioned deletion of the 13th base of the pUC18 polyclonal area). Encouragingly, after this single FACS round, we observed an 18-fold enrichment for FutA(+) cells (Fig. 3C), indicating that this new FACS system can effectively offer the performance required to enable sensitive screens for improved fucosylation activity.</p>
<p>Directed evolution of FutA Targeting increased catalytic efficiency toward acceptor LacNAc substrate, we performed three rounds of directed evolution for FutA. In the first round, an error-prone PCR was used to generate a random mutagenesis library; the second round used an ordered recombination mutagenesis (ORM) to accumulate optimal mutations; and the third round applied a combinatorial active-site saturation testing (CAST) (28) approach to specifically mutagenize 16 selected residues on the basis of structural analysis. The first round of directed evolution introduced random mutations in FutA encoding sequence by the error-prone PCR and generated a library of 4 × 106 unique colonies with two to five mutations per FutA gene variant. We used three FACS sorting iterations to successively enrich the top 0.5% of cells in terms of both green (bodipy conjugates) and blue (coumarin conjugates) fluorescence intensity. After each of the three sortings, the FutA gene of each “positive” cell was amplified using the FutA-F and FutA-R primers (table S4), and the PCR product was introduced into a new host cell. To confirm that this error-prone PCR-based round was indeed producing/identifying FutA variants with improved catalytic activity, we randomly selected 20 clones after the third round of FACS. Assays using LacNAc as the substrate showed that 40% of these mutant variants were at least 30% more efficient than wild-type FutA in transferring fucose onto LacNAc. Among these FutA variants, three mutants M11 (Y199N/V368A/D407N), M12 (S45F), and M13 (E340D) exhibited roughly twofold improvement over the activity of the wild-type enzyme (table S2). The next directed evolution round used the ORM to iteratively accumulate optimal mutations at four selected amino acid sites. The top four sites were selected on the basis of initial identification from the error-prone PCR round and on follow-up experiments that tested and ranked the individual contribution of those single point mutations (fig. S4). Considering that the single mutants S45F and E340D are already available, thus, we constructed other three single mutants Y199N, V368A, and D407N (designated M21, M22, and M23) to evaluate individual contributions. Assays showed that the single mutation E340D resulted in more pronounced improvement in catalytic activity than did other beneficial mutations, and therefore, the ORM path for this mutant was initiated. A new mutant, designated M24, was constructed by a combination of E340D and V368A. The activity of M24 further improved 2.3-fold against the wild type. By introducing the S45F mutation into M24, we generated the M25 variant. Adding Y199N mutation into the M25 further created a mutant named M26 (S45F/Y199N/E340D/V368A). Assay analysis revealed that the M26 obtained an overall 2.74-fold increase of specific activity against that of the wild type (table S2). Thus, the M26 was chosen as the template for the third round of directed evolution. It is known that amino acid residues near substrate-binding pockets often have particularly profound effects on enzyme catalysis (28). The mutagenesis component of the third round of directed evolution exploited this direction. This is a semi-rational method guided by (i) the crystal structure of wild-type FutA [Protein Data Bank (PDB): 2NZY] (29) and (ii) HotSpot Wizard 2.0 for automated identification of hotspots and smart libraries for protein engineering (30). In that, we selected all of 51 residues within 8-Å distance from the boundary surface of LacNAc and GDP-Fuc for target mutagenesis (fig. S5A). Moreover, the HotSpot Wizard algorithm provided a substrate-binding residue prediction based on a comprehensive sequence/structure alignment with the reported complex structures of GT acceptor. Sixteen predicted hotspot residues (V30, W33, E37, E38, K40, E41, N44, V46, G72, P74, L75, Y92, D127, H131, K223, and N226) were picked out for site-directed mutagenesis (fig. S5B). Upon applying the CAST strategy on FutA, the following amino acid clusters were defined V30/W33, E37/E38/K40/E41, N44/S45/V46, G72/P74/L75, D127/R128/H131, K223/N226, and Y92. Seven small libraries, A to G, respectively, were then created separately using complete saturation (i.e., simultaneous randomization of each cluster). These libraries were combined into a pooled library (library 2) comprising about 2 × 104 variants that was screened using the established FACS system to identify mutants with improved activity for both synthesized fluorescent substrates 1 and 2. Subsequently, we randomly selected and characterized 20 enriched variants by spectrophotometric and HPLC analysis. A mutant named M32 (S45F/D127N/R128E/H131I/Y199N/E340D/V368A) was identified as the most active FutA variant, exhibiting a more than 4.7-fold improvement in catalytic activity for LacNAc over wild-type FutA (table S3). In addition, an obviously improved K223E mutation found in M31 variant was also introduced into the M32 mutant. However, the resulting mutant, having eight residue substitutions, exhibited reduced enzyme activity compared to its parent (table S2) thus, the K223E mutation was not used further in efforts to improve catalytic efficiency.</p>
<p>Characterization and kinetic analysis of the directed evolution mutants Before further characterization, given that the directed evolution process is known to sometimes change the substrate and/or product profiles of target enzymes, we checked the reaction product(s) generated by the best mutant M32. After incubation of M32 with GDP-Fuc and LacNAc, HPLC–electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis revealed a single product peak of mass/charge ratio of 522.19 [M-H] eluting at 3.6 min, identical to the Lex reference standard. Moreover, HPLC–electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the Lex standard and the M32 product had identical fragmentation patterns (fig. S6), demonstrating that M32 catalyzes the same reaction as does wild-type FutA. To comprehend the specific activity improvement for the obtained beneficial FutA mutants, the kinetic parameters for LacNAc and GDP-Fuc substrates were first determined with the wild type, M26 and M32 mutants. Since FutA has a promiscuous activity to lactose, we also examined kinetic parameters for lactose as the acceptor substrate. It showed that a 4.1-fold improvement in the k cat /K m value of the mutant M26 arose from increases in the k cat values, with little effect on the K m values. Further mutations (D127N/R128E/H131I) led to progressive increases of catalytic activities, with the k cat /K m value of the best mutant M32 being sixfold higher than that of the wild type for LacNAc. The increase in k cat /K m for M32 was derived from a 10.8-fold decrease in the K m value for lactose compared with the wild-type enzyme, thus substantially increased binding affinity, while the k cat value for the GDP-Fuc donor increased 6.2-fold with little effect on the K m value (Table 1). Table 1 Kinetic parameters for wild-type FutA and selected beneficial mutants. The kinetic assays were performed in three independent replicates, and the fitting curves for the kinetic parameters are presented in fig. S7. View this table:
