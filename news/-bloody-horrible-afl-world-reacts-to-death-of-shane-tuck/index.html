<p>The AFL community has been left devastated by the death of Richmond champion Shane Tuck, with an outpouring of grief following his tragic death.</p>
<p>Tuck died on Monday morning at the age of 38, leaving behind wife Kat and children Will and Ava.</p>
<p>Tuck, a strong and tough midfielder, played 173 games for the Tigers before retiring in 2013 and was a life member of the club.</p>

<p>‘TOO RISKY’: Concerns as 25,000 flock to AFL derby</p>
<p>Richmond described Tuck as a courageous and brave player who was loved by his teammates, staff and fans off the field.</p>
<p>“We&rsquo;re incredibly saddened by the news of Shane&rsquo;s passing. He will be missed enormously by everyone,” Tigers CEO Brendon Gale said.</p>
<p>“We send our deepest condolences to Shane&rsquo;s family and loved ones - his wife Kat, children Will and Ava, parents Michael and Fay, and the extended Tuck family.</p>
<p>“Shane was a warrior on the field, giving everything to the team each week, and a humble, fun-loving person off the field.”</p>
<p>An extremely brave and courageous warrior on-field. A big-hearted character off the field.</p>
<p>You will be missed enormously by everyone, Tucky 💛 — Richmond FC 🐯🏆 (@Richmond_FC) July 20, 2020</p>
<p>Tributes flow after death of Shane Tuck</p>
<p>As tributes flowed on Monday evening, Richmond spearhead and former teammate Jack Riewoldt described Tuck as an inspiring character.</p>
<p>“You always walked taller when you had Shane Tuck playing next to you,” Riewoldt said on SEN radio.</p>
<p>“There are plenty of stories about Tucky and a lot of funny ones.</p>
<p>“He was one of those players that you loved to spend time with because there would always be a story come out of that.”</p>
<p>Former Richmond coach Terry Wallace was at the helm of the Tigers for 99 matches from 2005-09, and midfielder Tuck was the only player to feature in all of them.</p>

<p>“He was just a very lovable person and one of the great characters around that football club at the time,” Wallace told SEN.</p>
<p>“He was not the best player you&rsquo;ve ever seen but he was the epitome of honesty and the epitome of what people should love about their footy clubs.”</p>
<p>Richmond legend Kevin Bartlett wrote on Twitter: “So saddened by the passing of Shane Tuck.”</p>
<p>“We had some lovely conversations in the past as I was an admirer of the way he played with such commitment.</p>
<p>“When my daughter worked at Richmond she would always say he was the nicest person. Thinking of the Tuck family. RIP Shane.”</p>

<p>Terry Wallace coached across five seasons at Richmond. One player was a constant.</p>
<p>Shane Tuck - now dead at just 38.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I coached 99 games at Richmond and there was only one player who played in all 99 games alongside of me and that was Tucky,&rdquo; Wallace told SEN.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just devastating news and I feel so much for the family, his teammates and those around him.</p>
<p>Shane Tuck in action for Richmond during a 2012 match against Collingwood at the MCG. (Getty)</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was such a lovely guy. I couldn&rsquo;t speak more volumes about him. He was the typical country lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a loyal guy, he couldn&rsquo;t have been any more loyal to me. A very, very, very loveable person and one of the great characters around that football club at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During my time there, it wasn&rsquo;t easy but Tucky just kept fronting up week-in, week-out and doing what he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Richmond side lost more often than it won. This was the old Tigers.</p>
<p>But Tuck gave them spine. He was ferocious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a physical beast,&rdquo; Wallace said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Physically, he could take it up to anyone in the competition, and I&rsquo;m saying anyone, the best of the best midfielders toe-to-toe. He mightn&rsquo;t have had their wherewithal in regards to be being able to read the play and footy smarts but what he had was a toughness and a physicality that was almost unmatched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was tough and could play under any circumstances. In five years of me being there and to not miss one game&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not the best player you&rsquo;ve ever seen but the epitome of honesty and the epitome of what people should love about their footy clubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the common theme as tributes flowed for Tuck on Monday night. It hit Wallace hard - he also played alongside Shane&rsquo;s legendary father, Michael Tuck, for a decade at Hawthorn.</p>
<p>Shane Tuck was a Richmond life member who played 173 games for the Tigers from 2004-2013, kicking 74 goals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sad day for football,&rdquo; Richmond chief executive Brendon Gale told SEN.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think of the Tuck family and the contribution they&rsquo;ve made to the game over many years, and Shane came and forged his own career and was a wonderful servant of the club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get that news, it was quite confronting and we are quite numb. It&rsquo;s incredibly sad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a guy you&rsquo;d call straight up and down. He was tough as nails, he was extremely competitive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made the guys walk taller. On the field, I think of his physicality and off the field, I saw a guy with a big, generous heart. He&rsquo;d make people laugh, he had these funny little sayings and idiosyncrasies and never took himself too seriously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tuck dabbled in professional boxing post-footy, taking five fights during 2015-2017 for a 3-1-1 record. He fought some amateur bouts beforehand to tune-up, going 5-0.</p>
<p>Yet he was knocked out in the fourth round of his first pro fight, against Lucas Miller on an Anthony Mundine undercard. He had to be stretchered from the ring after being dropped by a savage right hook.</p>
<p>Many men wouldn&rsquo;t have tried again after such a brutal start but typical of Tuck, he returned stronger and then went undefeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew I had more than that, that wasn&rsquo;t me,&rdquo; he told News Corp, having been a keen fighter since childhood who used to keep an amateur boxing trophy by his bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a lot of respect for boxers, I think it&rsquo;s a really tough sport and mentally and physically one of the most demanding things you can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richmond will wear black armbands to honour Tuck in their Friday night game against GWS at Giants Stadium in Sydney.</p>

<p>Originally drafted by his father’s Hawthorn in 2000, Tuck received a second chance with Richmond and made his AFL debut in 2004.</p>
<p>He quickly became a regular, missing only five games between 2005 and 2010, and earning 35 Brownlow votes by the time he retired in 2013 as a Tigers life member.</p>
<p>Richmond described Tuck as a courageous and brave player who was loved by his teammates, staff and fans off the field.</p>

<p>“We’re incredibly saddened by the news of Shane’s passing, he will be missed enormously by everyone,” Tigers CEO Brendon Gale said.</p>
<p>“We send our deepest condolences to Shane’s family and loved ones – his wife Kat, children Will and Ava, parents Michael and Fay, and the extended Tuck family.</p>
<p>“Shane was a warrior on the field, giving everything to the team each week, and a humble, fun-loving person off the field.”</p>
<p>Richmond will pay tribute to Tuck by wearing black armbands during Friday night’s match against Greater Western Sydney.</p>
<p>Shane and father Michael sit third on the list of most AFL/VFL games played by a father and son combination, with 599 between them.</p>
<p>Michael Tuck was the former individual games record holder, having made 426 appearances for Hawthorn.</p>

&ldquo;Shane was a warrior on the field, giving everything to the team each week, and a humble, fun-loving person off the field.&rdquo; Richmond will wear black armbands against Greater Western Sydney this Friday night. Tuck, the son of legendary ex-Hawthorn skipper Michael Tuck, was on Hawthorn&rsquo;s list before his time at Punt Road but did not play a senior game for the Hawks. Jack Riewoldt described the late Shane Tuck, pictured, as an &ldquo;extremely loveable character&rdquo;. Credit:Fairfax Photographic He took his second chance, forging a successful career at Richmond after being plucked as a mature-age recruit. He was a shining light through several poor years for the Tigers, helping usher through a new generation of stars. He hung on to play a single final as a 31-year-old in 2013, his last AFL game before retiring.</p>
<p>Tuck&rsquo;s younger brother, Travis played 20 games for the Hawks between 2006 and 2009. In 2010 he became the first player to be suspended following a third strike under the AFL&rsquo;s illicit drugs policy, although it was deemed that his drug use was a result of depression and not recreational. On Monday former Richmond teammate Joel Bowden spoke glowingly of Tuck both as a person and a footballer. &ldquo;He was a unique character and was as hard at the ball as anyone in our team, if not harder,&rdquo; Bowden said. &ldquo;I remember he came in, and he was struggling in the twos, struggling for a bit of confidence, and we got into the team and we went to Brisbane. He played on Michael Voss. He probably broke even, but that was enough for him to get going in hindsight. He was a really strong, solid, tough footballer. &ldquo;He was funny, he was quirky. But he was a really good friend. I&rsquo;m just so sad, because his wife, Kat, and their kids, we spent a lot of time with them. He was a good guy. It&rsquo;s just really sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hawthorn also paid tribute to Tuck on Monday. &ldquo;On behalf of the Tuck family, the Hawthorn Football Club is deeply saddened to inform the football community of the passing of Shane Tuck,&rdquo; a statement read. &ldquo;Hawthorn Football Club and the entire football community extend their deepest condolences to the Tuck family and ask that their privacy is respected during this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terry Wallace - who coached Tuck between 2005 and 2009 at Richmond, and played with Michael at Hawthorn – said he was one of the toughest players he worked with. &ldquo;I always thought if he played any of the better players toe-to-toe they were never going to beat him,&rdquo; Wallace told SEN. &ldquo;He would play under any circumstances.&rdquo; Former teammate Jack Riewoldt said the club had been devastated since hearing the news earlier on Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He became a cult figure. People loved him,&rdquo; Riewoldt said. &ldquo;You always walked taller when you had Shane Tuck playing next to you. &ldquo;He was one of those players you loved to spend time with because there was always a story to come out of that. &ldquo;He was a footballer&rsquo;s footballer and he was an extremely loveable character.&rdquo; Shane Tuck became a &ldquo;cult figure&rdquo; at Richmond.

<p>Gale said Tuck was a beacon early in his days as chief executive, when the club was regularly given &ldquo;hidings&rdquo; on the field. &ldquo;We were quite numb [when told the news],&rdquo; Gale said. &ldquo;He was one of our great players. &ldquo;Then you think about his wife and children, it&rsquo;s just incredibly sad.&rdquo; Tuck embarked on a boxing career after his retirement from footy. He rose through the amateur ranks to fight in five professional bouts between 2015 and August 2017.</p>
<p>He won three times, lost once and drew his last bout. Need to talk to someone? Don&rsquo;t go it alone. Please reach out for help.
