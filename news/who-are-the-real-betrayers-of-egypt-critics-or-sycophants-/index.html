<p>On June 15, 2020, Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevlut Cavusoglu stated there are no disagreements between Russia and Turkey on the fundamental principles of the Libyan settlement. Moscow and Ankara are continuing negotiations at the technical level to develop a mechanism for establishing a ceasefire and start the process of political settlement of the Libyan conflict.</p>
<p>Who is Fighting in Libya?</p>
<p>In Libya over the past few years, two opposing authorities have existed in parallel, one of them is the Government of National Accord (GNA), based in Tripoli and led by Faiz Saraj. In the east, in the Tobruk, there is the Libyan House of Representatives, controlled by the commander in chief of the Libyan National Army (LNA) Khalifa Haftar. Since April 2019, the troops of H. Haftar besieged the Libyan capital. In November 2019, the Republic of Turkey and the government of F. Saraj signed a memorandum of understanding, which included the intensification of political and military-technical cooperation.</p>
<p>As a result of Turkish interference, the GNA forces managed to achieve significant military successes and go on the counterattack. The army of F. Saraj was able to lift the siege of Tripoli, which lasted 14 months and push the LNA from the Libyan capital. In April, the GNA troops established control over the coast in western Libya from Misrata to the border with Tunisia. Soon, the army of H. Haftar was forced to leave the capital airport, and Tarhuna, as well as al-Watiya airbase. Against the backdrop of the success of the government of F. Saraj, some Libyan Tuareg militias in southern Libya have expressed their support for Tripoli’s actions.</p>
<p>As a result of the GNA troops’ counterattack, the LNA supply system was violated, several key settlements of western Libya were captured, and the morale of H. Haftar was undermined. Now the fighting between the LNA and the army of F. Saraj is taking place on the approaches to the coastal Mediterranean city of Sirte, an important strategic point that is under the control of the LNA. The city is located on the way to oil fields in the east of the country, which are held by the army of H. Haftar, and if Sirte is taken from the GNA and their Turkish allies, the road is open for them.</p>
<p>What Role Does Turkey Play in the Libyan Conflict?</p>
<p>The situation at the front was changed thanks to large-scale intervention in the conflict by Turkey. Recep Tayyip Erdogan doesn’t hide that the victories over the troops of H. Haftar have achieved thanks to the Turkish soldiers and that the Turkish troops present in Libya are going along with the GNA to achieve common goals.</p>
<p>Ankara and Tripoli’s political and military-technical cooperation intensified after the signing of a memorandum of understanding in November 2019. The agreement between the GNA and Turkey defined the boundaries of Turkey’s exclusive economic zone in the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea, where there are large deposits of natural gas. Besides, the agreement implied the intensification of military cooperation. The Russian Foreign Ministry said that the agreement between Ankara and Tripoli on security cooperation is an attempt to legalize military support that violates the arms embargo. The EU, Egypt, Israel, Greece, and Cyprus condemned the signing of a memorandum that violates international law, and other countries of the Eastern Mediterranean claim gas production in this part of the sea. By contrast, Tripoli recognizes Turkey’s right to extract natural resources in the designated exclusive economic zone in exchange for support in the Libyan conflict. Indeed, Turkey has interests in Libya. Ankara declares that it intends to win contracts for the restoration of Libya, and in the future, it will participate in the production of Libyan oil.</p>
<p>Just a few days after the Berlin Conference on Libya in January 2020, the participants agreed to comply with the arms embargo on Libya, Turkey sent tanks, anti-aircraft guns Korkut, self-propelled howitzers T-155, cannons GDF, combat vehicles ACV-15 and jeeps with anti-tank guns to help Tripoli. The media report that the Republic of Turkey is also transporting Syrian militants to Libya, who are fighting on the side of the GNA.</p>
<p>It is known that Turkey plans to open two military bases in Libya. Ankara is planning to deploy air defense systems and drones at the recently captured al-Watiya airbase. Also, Turkish troops will be stationed at a military base near Misrata. Turkey has in Libya not only economic interests but also military-political ones. Firstly, the deployment of troops of the Republic of Turkey at Libyan bases will allow Ankara to make more influence on the political course of located in Tripoli government. Secondly, Turkey will create an additional factor holding back the hypothetical offensive of the army of H. Haftar. It is unlikely that the LNA leadership will be able to fight with the Republic of Turkey’s regular units. Thirdly, Turkey will deploy troops in a country neighboring Egypt, one of Ankara’s key foreign policy opponents.</p>
<p>How is Egypt Responding to Intensified Hostilities in Libya?</p>
<p>The offensive of the pro-Turkish GNA forces and Turkey excited the Egyptian military and political circles, who perceived the defeat of the LNA and the advance of the Tripoli army deep into the country as a threat to Egyptians national security. Egyptian Parliament Speaker Ali Abdel Aal said that Egypt will not allow pro-Turkish terrorists to control Libya. Besides, he also accused Turkey of wanting to colonize parts of the Arab world.</p>
<p>Egypt deployed part of the troops on the Egyptian-Libyan border. The media reported that the border with Libya was crossed by Abrams tanks and Mi-24 combat helicopters. It is also worth remembering that in the province Matruh, near the border with Libya, there is a large Egyptian military base named after the first president of Egypt, Mohammed Nagib. On its territory there are more than a thousand structures, about 20 thousand soldiers, hundreds of tanks, helicopters, boats, and air defense systems can be deployed here. The base is located close to the border with Libya, which, if necessary, allows Egypt to respond quickly to threats from a neighboring country.</p>
<p>Why Did Turkey and the Government of the National Accord not Accept the Cairo Declaration?</p>
<p>June 6, 2020, a conference was held in Cairo, during which the President of the Arab Republic of Egypt (ARE) Abdel Fattah al-Sisi came up with an initiative to overcome the Libyan crisis, the Cairo Declaration. The initiative provided for a complete ceasefire in Libya from June 8, the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the territory of the country, and the dissolution of all armed groups except for the LNA, which should ensure security in Libya. The proposals included the conditions for a political settlement of the conflict, in particular, the unification of Libyan political institutions and the creation of a presidential council with representatives of all three regions. It was planned that one of the three representatives would become president, and the other two persons would become his deputies. Egypt also called for continued talks in Geneva on the Libyan joint military commission in the 5+5 format.</p>
<p>The conference was attended by Egyptian President A.F. al-Sisi, Speaker of the Libyan House of Representatives Aquila Saleh, the meeting was also attended by representatives of the United States, Russia, France, and Italy. Russia, France, Germany, Great Britain, Cyprus, South Africa, the League of Arab States and its members (Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Bahrain, Algeria, Kuwait) have expressed support for the Cairo Declaration. The EU supported the initiative, drawing attention to the fact that nothing can replace the comprehensive world, an agreement on which was reached during the Berlin Conference. Cairo’s efforts have also been welcomed in the United States.</p>
<p>At the same time, there were no representatives of the GNA and the Turkish Republic at the Cairo conference. The terms of a political settlement proposed by the Egyptian president were not discussed with key participants in the conflict. Naturally, Ankara and Tripoli refused to accept the Cairo Declaration and hostilities continued. GNA troops continued the bombing of the city of Sirte: the last large settlement belonging to the western part of Libya and controlled by H. Haftar.</p>
<p>Even though Ankara and Tripoli did not participate in the discussion of the Cairo Declaration, the GNA is ready to take part in peace talks. At the same time, it is emphasized that negotiations are possible only after the troops of F. Saraj can capture Sirte and the military base Jufra. At the same time, the GNA announced that H. Haftar is a war criminal and that he cannot participate in any negotiations on the post-war structure of Libya, and the Minister of the Interior of the F. Saraj Government announced that Libya will not be able to end the war until it’s East is liberated from H. Haftar.</p>
<p>The GNA is ready to continue the attack on the position of the LNA. Turkish troops can play an important role in that, considering that Ankara doesn’t hide the presence of its troops in Libya. The escalation of hostilities in Libya is taking place against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. Coronavirus didn’t become a deterrent to hostilities. On the contrary, the warring parties decided to take advantage of the involvement of the rest of the world in the fight against the epidemic. H. Haftar declared himself the sole Libyan ruler, and the GNA went on the offensive. Missile attacks on Libyan cities lead to interruptions in the supply of water and electricity, which impedes the fight against the virus. Solving the problems caused by the epidemic seems less important to the top military-political circles of the warring parties than a war with each other. All this can contribute to the spread of coronavirus infection.</p>
<p>Egypt and Turkey, perhaps the main players on the Libyan chessboard, are not interested in further escalating the conflict. In July 2020, Ethiopia plans to begin filling the reservoir of the Hidase hydropower plant, regardless of whether Cairo, Khartoum and Addis Ababa manage to reach a compromise on the distribution of water resources of the Nile River. A potential blow to the irrigation system of Egypt is a threat no less significant than the civil war in Libya, so the Egyptian leadership will probably try to avoid the aggravation of the situation on several “fronts” at once. The Egyptian leadership has concerns that it is being dragged into the grueling Libyan war. Given the fact that the army of the Arab Republic has trouble in the fight against terrorists on the Sinai Peninsula, participation in a full-fledged military campaign may make Egypt boggle for a long time in Libya. Also, the Egyptian intervention would be negatively perceived by the world community, and this could lead to the introduction of economic sanctions against Egypt and hit the already fragile economy.</p>
<p>Turkey has announced the launch of the Claw-Eagle Operation. During it, the Turkish Air Force attacked the facilities of the Kurdistan Workers Party, which are located in northern Iraq. Another issue Turkey is forced to monitor is the actions of the Syrian Arab Republic army, which is fighting against terrorist groups in Idlib. The intensification of hostilities in Libya is also taking place against the backdrop of worsening relations between Turkey and Greece. This does not allow Ankara to be involved in the processes taking place in Libya as it would like.</p>
<p>H. Haftar will not give up without a fight. The LNA is going to restructure the main operational headquarters of the command for more effective interaction on the battlefield. Reinforcements are drawn to Sirt. However, in connection with the events of recent weeks, it has become more apparent that a military way to resolve the Libyan conflict is hardly possible. Egypt will not allow the complete defeat of the LNA, and Turkey will not allow the defeat of the GNA forces.</p>
<p>Understanding this forces the warring parties to discuss measures that can stop the bloodshed. The delegations of the GNA and LNA took part in the third round of talks on Libya in the format of a meeting of the joint military talks 5 + 5, during which the parties discussed a draft ceasefire agreement. Although the ceasefire was repeatedly broken, both H. Haftar and F. Saraj alternately refused to sign the ceasefire agreement, now there is a real possibility of a compromise. Turkey and the GNA are ready for negotiations, but they want to strengthen their position before them.</p>
<p>It is worth recognizing that the military solution to the Libyan issue has not justified itself. This means that if the warring parties cannot find a political solution to the conflict, Libya will remain a country divided into two parts for a very long time. Under these conditions, Russia can take the initiative. It can offer F. Saraj and H. Haftar to negotiate with the mediation of Russia and Turkey on the conditions for establishing a ceasefire. Then, when the shooting stops, initiate a discussion on the possibility of a political settlement of the Libyan conflict. Moscow and Ankara have extensive experience in finding a compromise on the most painful issues, and it is possible that the Libyan conflict is no exception.</p>

<h3 id="tone-deaf-enablers-and-sycophants-are-a-threat-to-trumps-re-election">&ldquo;Tone-deaf enablers and sycophants are a threat to Trump’s re-election&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.minotdailynews.com/images/2016/11/03084632/fblike.jpg" alt="img">
It was like Moses parting the Red Sea – except with blasts of tear gas. After authorities had attacked peaceful protesters with a chemical irritant, cameras followed President Donald Trump as he walked over and stood in front of a church near the White House. (It had earlier been damaged by a small fire in the unrest following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.) Trump thrust a Bible into the air above his head, looking out at the cameras like a child expecting his parents’ approval after scribbling on the walls.</p>
<p>The charade smacked of something that the U.S. State Department would sanction a foreign leader for doing in violation of citizens’ basic human rights.</p>
<p>Accompanying Trump were communications aides who were either too incompetent and tone deaf — or too sycophantic — to tell him that the staged photo op would be unappealing to anyone with an emotional quotient higher than drywall.</p>
<p>Unable to read the room amid the social unrest, Trump came off as insecure and desperate to recapture the eroding support of evangelical voters. The blatant pandering suggested that Trump thinks religious voters can be won over by superficial gestures. It reduces them and their values to an insulting one-dimensional caricature.</p>
<p>Trump’s attorney general, William Barr, who ordered the attack on protesters before accompanying the president, later found himself splitting hairs over whether or not the chemical used on them was an irritant. Instead of haggling over semantics, perhaps Barr’s next interview could settle the debate with a blast in the face with whatever was used on the protesters to see if he finds it irritating? Or maybe Barr can consult the State Department to see whether the same chemicals used in his attack on Americans would warrant punitive action – or at the very least, a stern lecture — by the U.S. if used by authorities in Syria, Iran, Hong Kong, or Venezuela.</p>
<p>Barr should have invested more energy upfront in convincing Trump that this idea for an outing was a bad one. The same goes for Pentagon brass who accompanied Trump. What were they even doing there, besides riding shotgun as Trump’s poor optics led them all off a political cliff?</p>
<p>Defense Secretary Mark Esper has said that he thought they were heading out to visit with the troops. He now claims that the church stunt came as a surprise to him. Even if that’s the case, it’s bad enough that Esper thought that it was a good look for Pentagon leadership to be hanging out with the troops in the same area where a crackdown was taking place on peaceful protesters objecting to abuse and overreach by authorities. Worse, Esper reportedly told state governors on a phone call to “dominate the battlespace,” referring to U.S. streets. Trump later parroted the term in a public statement. “It’s called dominate the streets,” Trump said, suggesting that he didn’t come up with this approach all by himself but had been egged on.</p>
<p>Joint Chiefs chairman Mark Milley, also part of Trump’s entourage for the event, dressed up for the trip to the church in camo-style battle fatigues, as though he were heading out on the town like a regular Fidel Castro.</p>
<p>U.S. militarism has finally come home to roost – and so now has the perception of domestic conflict resolution through a lens of brute force rather than thoughtful diplomacy. The opposition (in this case, the protesters) is considered a one-dimensional, homogeneous enemy to be dominated or subdued. It’s a view that has been reflected in statements made by Trump and his entourage conflating the vast majority of peaceful protesters with relatively minor extremist elements on both the right and left that have opportunistically exploited the protest movements to pursue their own agenda.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is displaying the kind of simple-minded approach to domestic affairs that has long been honed by the U.S. abroad. In the eyes of the government, foreign leaders that fail to kowtow to U.S. interests are tyrants, and the opposition is an ally. “The people” of these foreign countries are considered monolithic, and generally assumed to be in opposition to their leader. It’s a gross distortion of reality, but there’s little room for nuance when there’s an agenda to pursue.</p>
<p>Trump, like his predecessors, has bought into some of the worst knee-jerk foreign policy dogmatism. He has defended representatives of terror, sponsoring states while attacking and sanctioning those fighting against them, leaving little room for critical thought that strays from longstanding dogma. And now Trump is grafting that same lazy ideological approach onto American politics in the context of a presidential race, with average concerned citizens being mischaracterized and squared away into little political boxes. In an election where the winner will most likely be decided by the independent-minded voters rather than by party bases, this kind of intellectual laziness risks being a costly strategy.</p>

<p>A council has been criticised for using the coronavirus crisis as an “excuse to remove scrutiny”.</p>

<p>Breckland Council is said to have limited opportunities for opposition councillors to weigh in on decisions, due to the Covid-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>The accusation came after the council’s scrutiny chairman warned that oversight had been changed.</p>
<p>Timothy Birt, Green Party councillor for Saham Toney, said the council’s pandemic response had been “somewhat mediocre”.</p>
<p>The council held its first virtual meeting on Monday, June 1, which saw the cabinet discuss the financial impact of the crisis.</p>

<p>And commenting on a report on the authority’s response, Mr Birt said: “There’s a bit of sycophantic, self-congratulation in that document. The message is that it’s Breckland Council handing out money but this is implementation of a national policy. Our response has been somewhat mediocre.”</p>

<p>He added: “There is one area where we have badly fallen down. Breckland has a reputation for being poor at scrutiny.</p>
<p>“It looks like Covid-19 has been an excuse to remove scrutiny. The monitoring officer said at the moment it’s not a priority to respond to complaints.</p>
<p>“Where has scrutiny gone?”</p>
<p>Rhodri Oliver, scrutiny chairman, previously said: “There are still checks but it’s fair to say that we’re not doing it in a formal scrutiny meeting.”</p>

<p>But the council leader defended the authority’s actions.</p>
<p>Sam Chapman-Allen said: “I don’t think it’s us sitting here patting ourselves on the back. You had the ability to call in delegated decisions through the chairman of the scrutiny committee.</p>
<p>“For me, as the leader of the council, I sought consensus from my cabinet. I met with them before any decisions were made.”</p>
<p>And the Conservative member for Forest Ward added: “This isn’t for us to sit here and scrutinise what has occurred. That will come over the next days, weeks and months. There will be ample opportunity to scrutinise and it is right and proper to make sure we are fit for purpose and learn the lessons. But that day is not today.”</p>
<p>Bill Borrett, Conservative member for Upper Wensum, said he felt Mr Birt’s comments were “misjudged” and struck “absolutely the wrong tone”.</p>
<p>He added: “I think everybody has given 110pc and I’ve been very impressed with the response Breckland Council has managed.”</p>

Peter Farrar, Brighton East China is right: Australia is a lackey of the US Tim Pallas was rightly critical of Scott Morrison&rsquo;s remarks, parroting Donald Trump, about China being responsible for the coronavirus pandemic and calling for an independent inquiry into its causes. China is correct to label Australia as a lackey of the United States. China is our largest trading partner, providing $158billion of our export earnings and comprising 32per cent of our foreign trade. Australia&rsquo;s prosperity depends on the China market, not on the US. For the Prime Minister not to have realised that such remarks would provoke the reaction they have was crass stupidity. Large sectors of our economy are set to suffer at a time when they can least afford to do after years of drought, fires and now the pandemic. Barry Fox, South Melbourne</p>
<p>Our greed has led to our dependence on China While the focus of trade issues with China is around our export market, the other side of the coin is the dependence upon, or desire for, imports from that country. I suspect that if every product manufactured in China was removed from the shelves at Bunnings, they would be rather empty stores. Our degree of greed for a reasonable product at the cheapest price has possibly led to this trade dependence. To quote, &ldquo;lowest prices are just the beginning&rdquo;. Indeed. Greg Stark, Newtown Learning to live with a demanding &ldquo;boss&rdquo; Our relationship with China is a bit like an employee who works for a boss they do not like. We have to tolerate the situation because China bankrolls our national economic health. We can investigate other markets for our goods (look for another job, in the example of the employee) but we may have to live with the situation in the medium-term.</p>
<p>David Fry, Moonee Ponds Trade with nations with values akin to ours Thank you, Vicky Xiuzhong Xu, for your astute discussion of the need for Australia to stand up to the Chinese Communist Party. Australia should trade with countries that hold democratic values more akin to ours and stimulate local manufacture. Yet again the CCP under Xi Jinping has demonstrated an increasingly aggressive pursuit of its economic/political agenda using bullying tactics. Western democracies have played, and continue to play, into its strategic plan – witness their willingness to participate in the Belt and Road initiative. Our politicians and businesses have either been dazzled by greed or plain lazy, which has made Australia vulnerable to China&rsquo;s social/political whims. Henry Gaughan, Richmond</p>
<p>If only &lsquo;dump diplomacy&rsquo; hadn&rsquo;t intervened Most countries face enormous battles restoring their economies after COVID-19. Australia has the great advantage of assured, major exports to a huge customer, China. We are a lucky country. Oops, Australia had the great advantage. Thanks to dumb diplomacy. Peter Busch, Geelong West THE FORUM So what else is new?</p>
<p>This &ldquo;secret report&rdquo; into the Catholic Church contains nothing new (The Age, 22/5). As a keen Catholic convert almost 20years ago, I was elected a lay representative on the pastoral council of a diocese to make recommendations to the bishop. I left the pastoral council and the entire Catholic Church after about seven years of labouring under the misapprehension that clerical power structures were open to genuine respect and regard for the laity. It was well known more than two decades ago that &ldquo;the hierarchical nature of the church, coupled with its lack of governance, had created a culture of deferential obedience&rdquo; in which incompetence and a multitude of abuses of power flourished. The clerical Catholic Church will never accept that it should be subject to democratic process or equality, or that female leadership is valid. It will never accept that any bishop or priest should be accountable to a &ldquo;professional laity&rdquo;. The Archbishop of Brisbane&rsquo;s comment that this report&rsquo;s recommendations have &ldquo;far reaching implications for the church&rsquo;s life and mission&rdquo; sounds like a routine, paternal pat on the head for the faithful, who will be expected to continue to toe the deferential line. Michelle Goldsmith, Eaglehawk</p>
<p>The more things change Good God. Following the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, the Catholic Church ushers in a new period of enlightenment by hushing up its report on proposed church reforms. Mary Mack, Box Hill The gambling nightmare I was addicted to gambling for 35 years, and want to thank Carolyn Crawford for her article – &ldquo;Leave the poker machines turned off&rdquo; (Comment, 21/5).</p>
<p>I started gambling at the age of nine when a relative placed bets on the horses for me. At the age of 26, after losing my job and home to the addiction, I found myself committing armed robberies so I could gamble at Crown Casino while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. I ended up in prison. The pokies are the most insidious form of gambling as they are designed to strip you of all your money, let alone your dignity. I overcame my addiction and, for the past five years, have felt I have my life back. If any good can come from this COVID-19 lockdown, it will be that poker machines are not switched back or, at least, are programmed to do less harm. It may save a life. Ian Brett, West Heidelberg Fewer people, less mess I was amazed to see the cleanliness of public transport during recent travel to the city by train, then tram and finally on a bus. Even the seagulls at Frankston Station were unable to find their usual pickings on the trains. It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good.</p>
<p>Geoff Gowers, St Kilda West Holiday close to home Readers are calling for borders to be open (Letters, 22/5). I imagine a holiday north, away from the cold and into the warmer weather, would suit most of us. We would love to visit my mother-in-law for her 96th birthday but she (and we) knows this is not a sensible idea. Suggesting that Victorians should spend their tourist dollars in Queensland is insensitive when we have so many families without an income and unlikely to have a holiday any time soon. Instead, travel to Mildura or New South Wales. Or give some of those dollars to charities that are feeding people without any income. Sue Anson, Mount Macedon</p>
<p>Toughen up, Aussies There is so much whinging about the new restrictions affecting our lives that I wonder whether Australians of 2020 could cope with the changes World War II brought. Sons and husbands gone, air raid shelters in city streets, major upheavals to industry, tape and black paint on windows and more. Even us little kids – I was eight in 1940 – were affected. The big kids, 11 and 12 years old, had dug slit trenches in the parks near school and each week we had a practice where we all hurried in orderly files to the allotted trenches. Each with our cloth bag containing a bottle of water, a cork on a string to clench between our teeth when bombs landed nearby and a bandage. And that was in Perth, Australia, not where millions experienced the real horrors. We had better adjust our clocks. Tony Blackmore, Brunswick Right to take legal action</p>
<p>Perhaps if businesses were a bit better behaved, there would not have been a a 325per cent rise in class actions in the Federal Court over the past decade (The Age, 22/5). One assumes they have a case to answer otherwise they would not get to court. I hope Labor and the Senate crossbenchers do what they can to stop changes to regulations that would deny people with limited means accessing the court system. Ann Maginness, Cheltenham Who&rsquo;ll pick the crops? Britain has an interesting problem, with its fruit and vegetable crops needing to be picked – &ldquo;Pick crops &lsquo;for Britain&rsquo;, prince urges&rdquo; (World, 21/5). The crops are normally picked by poorly paid, foreign workers in poor working conditions. But the borders are now closed and locals will not lower themselves to these standards. I expect Australia will face this very same dilemma in six months. It would be nice if this could be sorted ahead of time so that our crops are not left to rot in the fields as is happening in Britain.</p>
<p>Jeff Moran, Bacchus Marsh Keeping air miles down I echo Alex Mungall&rsquo;s point about unnecessary air flights (Letters, 22/5). I travelled as a health care professional to Canberra from Melbourne every month as part of my work on a remote site in the Snowys. I often spoke with fellow travellers who had a scheduled meeting that morning and would return to Melbourne that afternoon. Face-to-face interactions have a new vitality in some businesses during COVID-19 and I am guessing the emphasis will be on Zoom, Skype and the like. Suzanne Clarebrough, Wangaratta</p>
<p>Need to be informed Residents and councils need to be alert to the planned roll-out of pole-mounted, mobile-phone base station infrastructure close to residential properties. Telcos can avoid informing residents about the sitings, and radiofrequency radiation safety, of these installations by hiding behind federal &ldquo;low impact&rdquo; legislation. TPG has already rolled out installations with insufficient consultation with residents. While the need for such infrastructure to support mobile phone businesses is understood, this can be achieved by sharing existing sites or selecting new ones further away. People can check the status of planned installations on the Radio Frequency National Site Archive&rsquo;s website. However, more information is required to justify which alternative sites have been considered. TPG appears to have ignored residents&rsquo; complaints. This is likely to alienate existing and potential customers. Affected residents should make their concerns known to their councils and federal MPs. Les Davey, radiocommunications engineer, Camberwell</p>
<p>Thin edge of the wedge If builders are permitted to start work at 6am on weekdays during this pandemic (The Age, 20/5), only the very naive would believe that this law will be repealed at some later date. Christine Hurwood, Newport Clean, quiet travel Keith Handscombe (Letters, 22/5) suggests buses should be constructed with electric motors and solar panels. It is recommended that during construction, a quiet room could be installed at the rear of the bus.</p>
<p>Doug Shapiro, Doncaster East A glorious instrument I love Golding&rsquo;s cartoons, but the reference to the sound of the recorder being something you would wish to stay four kilometres away (The Age, 20/5) from was yet another dig at this much maligned, beautiful instrument. However, being a recorder teacher I still had a jolly good laugh. Suzanne Palmer-Holton, president, Victorian Recorder Guild, Seaford AND ANOTHER THING</p>
<p>Environment What&rsquo;s &ldquo;missing&rdquo; (22/5) in the climate plan? The climate. Denise Stevens, Healesville Morrison needs look no further than Parliament House for all the gas he needs.</p>
<p>John Cain, McCrae Is Angus Taylor&rsquo;s policy just a lot more gas? Hans Paas, Castlemaine For a road map, this looks like spaghetti. Let&rsquo;s try everything without a specific direction. Carolyn Ingvarson, Canterbury</p>
<p>Scientists are seen as oracles during the pandemic, but out-of-touch academics with climate change. Rob Head, Princes Hill China Scotty from marketing should know that if you are trying to sell a product, it&rsquo;s best not to upset the buyer. Les Anderson, Woodend</p>
<p>China will do what it wants, when it wants to. It&rsquo;s unstoppable. John Rawson, Mernda One thing about China, it never wastes an opportunity. Ian Maddison, Parkdale As bat guano is used in Chinese traditional medicine (22/5), Kew residents have a nice little earner in Yarra Bend Park.</p>
<p>Ian Powell, Glen Waverley Mary Wise, (21/5) that &ldquo;sleeping bear&rdquo; is striding around the forest, slapping down and clawing at any critters that stand in its path or defend their own berry patch.

<p><img src="https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/4/y/m/r/8/5/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.4ymtp7.png/1592436491108.jpg" alt="img">
OPINION: The City of Hamilton, by any other name, will still be Hamilton but those who demand a name change and for statues to be taken down should be careful what they ask for.</p>
<p>Along with a name change will come a significant cost for ratepayers and businesses in the change of signage, stationary, maps and GPS location data. More importantly they risk driving yet another wedge between an already overly divided society. That division is driven by a sycophantic attitude to all things Maori at almost all levels of government to the point where we are on the brink of creating an informal duality of citizenship that can only have a bad outcome.</p>
<p>Those people who issued threats to pull down or damage the statue of Captain John Hamilton make Don Quixote look like Mother Teresa and demands to change the name of the city to Kirikiriroa are just as foolish. Is it any wonder that there is so much ill-feeling among the wider community towards Treaty of Waitangi and Maori issues when we have this nonsense erupting from a few ill-advised activists from time to time?</p>

<p>Hamilton City Council &lsquo;weak&rsquo; for pulling down colonial statue</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The attack last year on the statue of Captain Hamilton raised a furious tornado of ill-feeling, accusation and counter accusation but, it seems, nothing was learned from that. Captain Hamilton, commander of HMS Esk, was killed at the Battle of Gate Pa at Pukehinahina near Tauranga on April 29 1864. Four months after the battle, when hostilities in Waikato had all but ended, the British military camp about five kilometres away from the seasonal fishing village of Kirikiriroa had grown into a European settlement. On August 24, Colonel William Moule named the little village after Captain Hamilton and the two communities co-existed for several years.</p>
<p>One of the reasons given for the attack on the statue was that the British forces had been murderers. While the use of military force in Waikato in 1863 was subsequently found to be illegal by British authorities the actions of frontline fighters on both sides of the conflict were not illegal.</p>
<p>A number of official enquiries have established that the British soldiers and sailors were acting under military orders and Maori fighters were not in rebellion against the Crown but legally defending their homes against a hostile invader. As in all wars there were atrocities and acts of gallant humanity on both sides but the British and Maori combatants were not murderers. To claim otherwise is to engage in myth making.</p>
<p>This latest set of demands to rewrite history, or erase those parts some people don’t like, has grown out of the Black Lives Matter slogan presently sweeping the world. The mistreatment of African Americans, from the era of slavery to the present day, is something only America can correct. Showing moral support for the victims of such mistreatment however is commendable and typical of mainstream New Zealand more so than most other countries. Attempting to translocate that cause to New Zealand and then demand name changes for cities and the removal of statues and memorials on the spurious argument that they represent everything from slavery and oppression to murder and racism might convince a few politicians, out of fear of being labelled racist but most people will simply disengage at best or retaliate with equally ill-informed demands.</p>
<p>It should not be forgotten that the initial economy of almost every nation in the world, including New Zealand, was built on slave labour. From the Roman Empire to early Britain slaves, serfs and peasants were a massive forced labour source. Even the Australian economy was initially built on the forced labour of transported convicts. The 1830s flax industry of Wellington, commanded by Te Rauparaha, and the kauri timber trade in Hokianga, commanded by Tamati Waka Nene and others were both totally reliant on thousands of slaves. When Maori invaded and conquered the Chatham Islands in the same era the resident Moriori, who survived the initial conflict, were enslaved. It was simply the way things were done back then by all nations. If we were to pull down the statue of every person involved in or who might have benefited from slavery there would be very few statues anywhere in the world and that may not be a bad thing.</p>
<p>New Zealand has, with doubt, a serious issue with racism which few are prepared to admit let alone address. But it needs to be resolved by an intelligent, well-informed and honest discussion. Changing names and removing memorials to the past will just make that task harder as the majority of people will simply continue to turn their backs on it.

<h3 id="400-tweets-585-miles-9-billion-trumps-border-wall-boondoggle--mother-jones">&ldquo;400 Tweets. 585 Miles. $9 Billion: Trump’s Border Wall Boondoggle – Mother Jones&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/20200323_walls-master-b_2000.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
“We need the wall more than ever!” President Trump tweeted on March 10—one day before the WHO declared the coronavirus a global pandemic—just another of his more than 400 tweets about his dream of building a wall along the US-Mexico border. According to a Mother Jones analy­sis of government contracts, the Trump administration has so far doled out over $9 billion to build about 585 miles of wall—285 miles of replacement fencing and 300 miles of new construction. In Trumpian fashion, the project has been characterized by cost overruns, lawsuits, sycophantic contractors, and a notoriously ineffective (and incomplete) final product.</p>
<p>Walking the Line</p>
<p>A tour of the Trump border wall</p>
<ol>
<li>Near San Diego, California: In March 2018, Trump reviewed eight wall prototypes in San Diego. The Government Accountability Office noted that many, if not all, of the designs would be difficult to build along much of the border; Customs and Border Protection found that all were vulnerable to breaching. In the end, none were adopted, and the $3 million samples were destroyed in early 2019.</li>
</ol>
<p>On a September 2019 trip to the border, Trump called new steel-and-concrete bollards he saw “virtually impenetrable.” Two months later, the Washington Post reported that Mexican drug smugglers had been cutting through them.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Near Calexico, California: A viral tweet in December 2019 showed a 16-year-old using a rope ladder to scale a newly replaced section of the wall. Border Patrol officials insisted “the border wall system worked exactly as designed,” and that the boy was apprehended.</li>
</ol>
<p>In January, several recently installed panels of the wall collapsed in high winds in Calexico, California.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Arizona: Contractors have been blasting ground for the wall in Monument Hill, an area of Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument that contains burial grounds of the Indigenous O’odham people. “This is a total desecration of Native land,” one activist said.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sunland Park, New Mexico: After raising $20 million on GoFundMe, a group called We Build the Wall put up a half-mile of wall on private property in New Mexico in May 2019. The group, whose advisory board includes Steve Bannon, was reportedly negotiating with the White House to build and “donate” more walls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>McAllen, Texas: In late 2017, Hidalgo County, Texas, sued several companies owned by a former county official, his wife, and their two sons for being part of a kickback scheme tied to a $232 million Homeland Security wall construction project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Near McAllen, Texas: Plans to build a wall through the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge could degrade the habitat of many animals, including endangered ocelots and jaguarundis, as well as mountain lions, bobcats, collared peccaries, nine-banded armadillos, chachalacas, plains blind snakes, Texas earless lizards, Texas horned lizards, barred tiger salamanders, Rio Grande chirping frogs, southern yellow bats, and 400 species of birds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Over the Top</p>
<p>The rising cost of a border boondoggle</p>
<p>Besides falsely claiming Mexico will foot the bill, Trump has consistently lowballed the price of his wall.</p>
<p>Off the Wall</p>
<p>Trump’s wildest wall wishes</p>
<p>Trump originally said his wall should be solid—“no windows, no nothing, precast concrete going very high.” But that wasn’t his most unrealistic proposal, according to New York Times reporters. As for the slatted steel wall that’s actually being built? “He thinks it’s ugly,” a White House official told the Washington Post.</p>
<p>Fisher’s Price</p>
<p>How one company laid a foundation for cashing in on the wall</p>
<p>2017: Fisher Sand &amp; Gravel, a North Dakota construction company, is contracted by the US Army Corps of Engineers to develop an all-concrete border wall prototype, but its model isn’t selected.</p>
<p>2018: Fisher spends $75,000 on “homeland security” lobbying—15 times what it spent in 2017.</p>
<p>January 2018: Then-Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) invites company CEO Tommy Fisher—whose family had donated $8,000 to Cramer over the years—to attend the State of the Union address, in which Trump again calls for building a wall.</p>
<p>March 2018: In one of his at least 10 Fox News appearances between January 2018 and May 2019, Tommy Fisher touts his company’s wall-building skills on The Ingraham Angle: “If [Trump] allows our team, Fisher Industries, to play, I guarantee, no different than Tom Brady—once we get in we never come out, and if we don’t perform, the president can fire us.”</p>
<p>May 2019: The Washington Post reports that Cramer, now a senator, and Jared Kushner are lobbying to get Fisher Industries a border wall contract. Cramer says Trump had twice mentioned wanting Fisher to build some of the wall. “He always brings them up,” Cramer says.</p>
<p>November 2019: Fisher starts building a $40 million, 3-mile stretch of border wall on private land in South Texas. (We Build the Wall kicks in $2 million.) The project is put on hold when Fisher is sued by federal prosecutors and a butterfly sanctuary. Fisher tells Texas Monthly the plans to sell the wall to the government.</p>
<p>December 2019: Fisher Sand &amp; Gravel is awarded a $400 million Pentagon contract for wall construction in Yuma County, Arizona. Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, asks for an investigation into whether the contract was the result of “inappropriate influence.”</p>
<p>April 2020: Fisher scores a $7.6 million contract to build 800 more feet of wall near Yuma. “Army Corps resources should be put to better use responding to the coronavirus pandemic,” Thompson tells the Daily Beast.</p>
<p>May 2020: The Washington Post reports that Trump is still pushing the idea of painting the fence black, which could add at least $500 million to the cost of the project. The Post also reports that Trump asked his aides to get input from Fisher Sand &amp; Gravel.</p>
<p>Later in the month, the Army Corps of Engineers awards one of its largest Trump border wall contracts to Fisher— $1.28 billion to build about 42 miles of wall in Arizona.

<h3 id="comparing-the-hunger-games-prequel-book-and-shakespeares-coriolanus">&ldquo;Comparing The Hunger Games Prequel Book and Shakespeare&rsquo;s Coriolanus&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://bleedingcool.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pjimage-79-1200x628.jpg" alt="img">
I know, the title reads like a term paper written for extra credit by a sycophantic Literature major, but bear with me. I love the universe of The Hunger Games, and the subsequent prequel book, A Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes almost as much as I love the classic Shakespeare tragedy Coriolanus. Warning: there will be spoilers for both the Hunger Games series (prequel book included) and the play Coriolanus.</p>
<p>Those of you familiar with the prequel and the character of President Snow may know that his first name is Coriolanus, just like the titular character in the play. But how far do those similarities between the characters and their stories go? Let&rsquo;s dive in and find out because I think it goes beyond just their names.</p>
<p>The Hunger Games Overlapping With Shakespeare</p>
<p>Coriolanus Snow is the central character of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, Caius Marcius Coriolanus, being the Roman war hero of the titular play. Both characters at their root are ambitious and self-serving – they feel entitled to the best and are willing to betray whomever they need to – be it best friends, family, or country – to get ahead and seize the power they feel is rightfully theirs.</p>
<p>At the start of each of their stories, both Snow and Caius Marcius are somewhat overlooked and seen as part of the pack, so to speak. Neither is on the fringe of society – they&rsquo;re both very much a part of respected society, but within that hierarchy, there&rsquo;s still ranks to climb to achieve fame and notoriety.</p>
<p>In the hero&rsquo;s journey, there comes a point for the character to prove himself; for Caius Marcius, this comes in the war against Volsci at the battle of Corioli where he breaches the gates and slaughters their army, leading the way for the Roman army to conquer the city and win. For Snow, his moment to prove himself as more than an orphan of war and the last of his family name comes when he mentors the eventual winner of the tenth annual hunger games.</p>
<p>Each Coriolanus is successful at this challenge as they get what they want, though, like any good narrative, it does have some unforeseen consequences. Snow&rsquo;s consequences were being forced to join the peacekeepers and assigned to district 12 – a life on the fringes. Caius Marcius, now given the moniker Coriolanus after his war efforts, runs for Senate and is elected. However, his fellow Senators turn against him and have him banished for being a traitor.</p>
<p>This is the low point in each of the characters&rsquo; eyes, though their stories offer them both a path back to the life they knew and the idea of success they still cling to. For Snow, this comes in the form of his best friend and classmate, Sejanus. He gets himself banished as well and is assigned to the same peacekeeper unit as Coriolanus. However, the reunion is short-lived as Sejanus has a rebellious heart and makes plans to run away, disappearing into the north, beyond the reach of the Capitol. Snow sells him out for a ticket back into the Capitol&rsquo;s good graces and gets all the power he dreamed of – that is until he&rsquo;s brought down by one Katniss Everdeen and the rebel uprising, but his eventual downfall was inevitable.</p>
<p>Why was it inevitable? Because the same thing happened to Caius Marcius Coriolanus. After he was banished, he allied himself with Volsci and joined their ranks with the intent to bring down Rome as an act of vengeance. This ultimately led to his downfall as his mother persuaded him to seek peace between the two armies, which the Volsci responded to by executing Caius Marcius Coriolanus as retribution for his betrayal.</p>
<p>The Title Character isn&rsquo;t Where the Similarities End</p>
<p>Also worth noting is that both Coriolanus characters have a Volumnia in their life; For Caius Marcius, that&rsquo;s his mother – the very person who pushed him to run for Senate, inciting his eventual downfall. For Snow, that person is Dr. Volumnia Gaul, head game maker for the hunger games and absolute mad scientist. Being that Snow is still in school, she acts as an advisor, always challenging Coriolanus to be more ruthless and uncaring with human life and fates, hoping to instill a sense of her own lack of morality in him.</p>
<p>Both Volumnias used their Coriolanus like a puppet as a means to shift the status quo as they saw fit while at the same time destroying their Coriolanus. In Coriolanus, this comes when Volumnia persuades Cauis Marcius to broker peace between Rome and Volsci, effectively betraying yet another nation and leading to his execution for such actions. In The Hunger Games, Dr. Gaul slowly manipulates Coriolanus Snow into devaluing humanity and seeing life through the same elitist and self-serving lens that she does while training him to carry on and expand her ruthless legacy in the hunger games.</p>
<p>Each Character&rsquo;s Victory Leads To Their Downfall</p>
<p>Eventually, this does lead to Snow&rsquo;s downfall in the form of the oppressed rising up against the Capitol, refusing to take part in his ruthless form of society any longer. His hubris leads him to poison his political adversaries, though he had to poison himself too in order to divert suspicion. His death was caused by choking on his own blood while laughing at the death of his successor.</p>
<p>Both Coriolanus characters are ruthless and manipulate those around them as they themselves are manipulated by Volumnia. And so the wheel turns – war, valor, exile, betrayal, redemption, and finally, the fall. The arcs of the characters follow the same pattern, just as a bevy of modern works have drawn their inspirations from the Bard&rsquo;s characters and stories, my personal favorite being the parallels between Sons of Anarchy and Hamlet.</p>
<p>Overall, both stories are excellent on their own; however, when placed side by side, they bolster one another and prove the stories and characters are powerful enough to endure.
