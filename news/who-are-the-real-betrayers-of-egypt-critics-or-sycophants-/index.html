<p>Bretford was good at providing power for AV equipment, and it evolved from carts to furniture, outfitting things like conference rooms and computer labs in schools.</p>
<p>Last year, it received patents for a power strip used in classrooms to allow multiple laptop users to plug in safely from a single outlet, as well as mobile lockers used by schools and companies to recharge and protect tablets and laptops.</p>
<p>The company claims to have begun selling the first commercial charging cart for laptops in 1999. The charging cart almost didn&rsquo;t survive, but then the company landed a partnership with Apple in 2008. The carts have evolved, allowing for machines to be updated automatically and have data wiped between uses. Bretford developed software to allow customers to manage the devices remotely.</p>
<p>The coronavirus has schools focused less on carts needed to haul and store computers on-site, but Bretford is getting a lift from corporate users, such as hospitals and manufacturers. With more employees working from home, its lockers fill a different need: touchless tech support. &ldquo;If a computer breaks, they can just drop off a computer for a no-touch swap,&rdquo; Petrick says.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>UPTAKE TECHNOLOGIES</li>
</ol>
<p>What it does: Data-analytics software for industrial companies | Patents last year: 15</p>
<p>Uptake Technologies helps companies keep their equipment running by having a better idea of when it might fail.</p>
<p>Groupon co-founder Brad Keywell launched the company in 2014 using Big Data to improve industrial performance. Uptake uses data captured by sensors on trains, construction equipment, wind turbines, trucks and the like to save companies money by making their machines perform better.</p>
<p>Several of the innovations that landed Uptake on Crain&rsquo;s Most Innovative Companies list are linked to its Radar product, which monitors vast amounts of data coming from sensors on rail cars, trucks and other equipment, applying algorithms to the information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re able to see patterns in data leading up to failure,&rdquo; says Brian Silva, a director of data science at Chicago-based Uptake. &ldquo;For on-highway trucks, unplanned failures can be very expensive repairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company says it saved one customer $50,000 engine replacements by recommending $8,000 repairs. Uptake estimates its software helps customers reduce maintenance costs by as much as $1,250 a year per truck.</p>
<p>Uptake also developed a way to do virtual load tests on locomotives, rather than pulling them out of service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Industrial data is different from other kinds of data,&rdquo; says Dennis Lee, Uptake&rsquo;s deputy general counsel. &ldquo;There are so many challenges: in gathering it, processing it, then providing it to the customer in a way that&rsquo;s useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uptake, which grew to more than 800 employees in its early days but has shrunk to about one-third of that size, has generated 33 U.S. patents, including 15 granted last year. One of those patents, for determining health scores for equipment or systems, was cited in patents by IBM, Equifax and others.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>RTC</li>
</ol>
<p>What it does: Retail shelf display systems Patents last year: 12</p>
<p>Walk into a store, and RTC&rsquo;s innovation is all around you. For decades, the Rolling Meadows-based company has been making retail shelves smarter, sturdier and easier to stock.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the top makers of retail displays—customized wood, metal and plastic devices that show off and dispense everything from drink bottles and razor blades to shoes and audio equipment. The company also has been a top performer on Crain&rsquo;s Most Innovative Companies list for the past five years.</p>
<p>Recent innovations include pushing the internet of things from the loading dock to the store shelf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is incredible pressure on physical retail to become more and more cost- and space-efficient,&rdquo; says CEO Richard Nathan, whose father, Walter, founded the company in 1950 as a maker of cardboard tubes. &ldquo;Our patents can bring inventory tracking and reporting down to the individual product, which then allows the store to react more quickly to low- or out-of-stock product. Out-of-stocks on a store visit is another sale for Amazon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>RTC received a patent last year on a wireless-communication hub that allows retailers to receive real-time information from sensors on store shelves. The technology, which is related to earlier innovations that included bringing digital messaging capabilities to the edges of shelves, gives stores the ability to communicate with customers, manage inventory and disseminate real-time video images to deter theft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe there are countless opportunities to leverage wireless technology, a network of sensors and intelligent software. We don&rsquo;t understand what all of the opportunities are, but we are ready to implement solutions as we figure it out,&rdquo; Nathan says.

Tech Startups Build Innovative AIoT Applications</p>
<p>Article By : EE Times Taiwan</p>
<p>At the recent TIE show, we caught up with tech startups &amp; teams from nextDrive, AIWin, TMYTEK, imec Taiwan, and DSP Concept to share their creative and smart technologies&hellip;</p>
<p>“Internet of Things” (IoT) is becoming a key opportunity for developing emerging businesses. This is especially true as AI (artificial intelligence) integrated internet applications are developing rapidly, and more and more startups or research teams are integrating the domain know-how of their respective fields through big data analytics and landing various “AI+IoT” (AIoT) applications. This has created new applications based on smart voice, internet of energy (IoE), smart healthcare, smart manufacturing, and 5G connectivity.</p>
<p>According to predictions by market research company Fortune Business Insights, the global IoT market will exhibit rapid growth at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.7% and achieve a market scale of USD $1102.6 billion in 2026. Here, developments in AI-based technologies will become the main driving force in the growth of this market. Additionally, with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic since early this year, Fortune Business Insights predicts that this will be a massive opportunity for industry innovation.</p>
<p>In order to grasp the enormous commercial opportunities of IoT (Internet of Things) and comprehensively utilize Taiwan’s industry advantages in ICT (information communications technology), the National Development Council (NDC) initiated the “Asia Silicon Valley Development Plan” (ASVDP) in June 2016 with the mission to “promote research and innovation in the IoT industry” and “establish a healthy startup ecosystem based on innovation.” The initiative drives the development of Taiwan’s IoT industries in the aspects of funding, talent, regulations, and markets while also supporting the growth of startups.</p>
<p>Over the past 4 years, ASVDP has been assertive in building an innovative startup ecosystem based on research and development. The program is connected to core global technology clusters and has introduced global resources and innovative capability to assist more than 78 Taiwanese startups in securing over USD $2 million in funding as well as supporting startups with opportunities in foreign markets.</p>
<p>We had the opportunity to interview several noteworthy startups from ASVDP at the Taiwan Innotech Expo (TIE) including nextDrive, AIWin, TMY Technology, imec Taiwan, and DSP Concept who shared their new and extremely creative smart technologies.</p>
<p>DSP Concept: “Sound” is the Key Element of Smart Products</p>
<p>DSP Concept, a company that identified market demand for smart voice control and advanced audio applications is focused on audio algorithm development tools and audio products. With support from ASVDP, the company has expanded their digital signal processing technology from Taiwan to Asia to drive development of innovative audio technology in the region.</p>
<p>DSP Concepts provides a standardized and advanced audio integration platform that allows chip vendors, semiconductor IP operators, ODM/OEMs, systems integration vendors, and third party algorithm providers to accelerate development of audio products through an intuitive audio processing software with a drag-and-drop UI that requires zero coding.</p>
<p>For IoT systems based on voice interfaces such as voice assistants, smart TVs and speakers, TalkTo AFE can utilize machine learning to deliver a crystal clear and quiet room experience. The TalkTo microphone processing algorithms instantly picks up wake-words and any given voice command even in the most noise-saturated environments, cancelling up to 30dB of unreferenced noise. The audio-processing engine AWE Core features a library of over 400 audio building blocks and support for hyper-efficient IoT devices to ultra-premium automotive systems, allowing for easier management and integration of embedded audio features, saving more than 90% in development time.</p>
<p>Audio Weaver Designer is a low-code/no-code graphical development platform that can facilitate optimized embedded signal processing in semiconductor wafers. This allows users to quickly manufacture, integrate, and deploy advanced audio functions.</p>
<p>As a native from Kaohsiung, Taiwan, DSP Concepts CEO and co-founder Chin Beckmann says: “Everything that’s smart begins by obtaining different data and in the current environment, sound is the key element for all smart products. DSP Concept’s innovative Audio Weaver is an open platform that will facilitate and accelerate the smart development of audio products.”</p>
<p>DSP Concepts demos their smart audio and noise cancelling solutions at TIE</p>
<p>IMEC: Smart Healthcare in the Post-Pandemic Era</p>
<p>The research institute IMEC, headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, saw Taiwan’s key role in the electronics supply chain and established IMEC Taiwan in 2008. In addition to proximity to the advanced manufacturing and development of semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), they have also begun to pay attention to the endless stream of innovation from rapidly emerging startups in Asia.</p>
<p>Steven Chao, Business Development Manager of IMEC says: “IMEC is highly interested in startup partners who have the ability to propose creative or new applications that are not seen in the market. These companies may be unfamiliar with related technology and electronic design, but this gives IMEC the prime opportunity to combine product design and technology.” Aside from focusing on forward-looking R&amp;D of semiconductor manufacturing processes, IMEC seeks to work with European and Asian startups to develop technologies, chips, complete systems grade products, and assist with accelerating the development and launch of innovative products.</p>
<p>One of the strengths at IMEC is their expertise in advanced medical sensing technology. With support from ASVDP, IMEC demonstrated the results of their development in innovative smart healthcare at this year’s TIE. IMEC focuses on current medical sensing technology to provide wearable, implantable, ingestible, and non-contact solutions that provide real-time monitoring of physiological information in combination with algorithms for accurate medical recommendations. Ingestible sensing technology such as microelectronic pills integrated with wireless transfer, video, and sensing technology is expected to become a reality within 5-10 years. In the future, patients can simply swallow this plastic pill to clearly view their body’s internal condition without having undergo a painful gastroscopy or colonoscopy.</p>
<p>As the global pandemic continues, IMEC has been praised for developments in contact-less technologies such as the millimeter wave radar. Steven Chao mentions that the contact-less technology is integrated with a patented radar design and smart AI algorithm developed by IMEC to detect a patient’s physiological condition without the need for close contact. The technology can sense heartrate, breathing, and other micro vibrations for doctors to interpret symptoms and diagnose diseases.</p>
<p>IMEC demonstrates the results of their latest smart healthcare sensing technologies</p>
<p>NextDrive: Successful Entrance into Japan’s Energy Market</p>
<p>NextDrive is Taiwan’s first supplier to successfully enter Japan’s energy market. Based on the introduction given by the company’s Chief Marketing Officer Martita Yi, NextDrive was founded in 2013 for the production of their micro IoT wireless expandable hard drive Plug. The product was originally designed to work as an IoT hardware platform but fortunately, they received the attention of an energy systems integration company from Japan at an exhibition and began providing home energy management systems (HEMS) for Japanese households 4 years ago.</p>
<p>Using the simple method of a gateway and app, the system was gradually developed to become a comprehensive IoE (Internet of Energy) solution – this provided a comprehensive energy management platform from the end-user to the power company, allowing them to understand end-users’ energy consumption habits. The data collected and analyzed through this platform can be used to improve network application services.</p>
<p>NextDrive exhibited their smart energy gateway Cube at TIE. The product includes built-in communication interfaces such as Wi-SUN, Wi-Fi, and BLE, allowing it to connect wirelessly to smart electric meters and gather detailed electricity data through a dedicated app. Cube can also be paired with home electrical appliances using ECHONET Lite to regulate their electricity consumption. In addition to energy applications, the Cube gateway’s portable design allows it to be broadly integrated in multiple scenarios using IoT applications such as home security, access monitoring and control, and elderly care.</p>
<p>Their other product, Atto, is a smart gateway with both data collection and computing functions. Atto can collect data from smart electric meters through Wi-SUN and uses RS-485 and two USB ports to connect with solar panels, batteries, and other energy devices. The built-in nano SIM card uploads data to the cloud, thereby enhancing the reliability and stability of data transmission. By simply installing Atto in the home, one can easily and automatically collect data for electricity generation and usage as well as provide stable data transfer services.</p>
<p>Compared to competitor solutions, the strengths of NextDrive are in software/hardware integration and cloud services. Martita Yi states “while we produce gateways, we’re better defined as a software company. This is because our IoE system integrates hardware technology, internet connectivity, and services.” Additionally, she emphasizes that NextDrive has been working with professional enterprises in the field of energy since the beginning; not only have they received support to successfully enter into energy markets, this will also be beneficial in creating new paths in the future.</p>

<p>AIWin: AI Integration with Image Recognition for Smart Factories</p>
<p>AIWin Technology is focused on utilizing AI and image recognition technology in quality inspection solutions for smart factories. The company’s General Manager, Aaron Lin Ph.D., introduced the company by mentioning that prior to being founded in 2016, the startup had already accumulated a significant amount of development experience in AI and deep learning and gradually developed creative industry solutions based on AI and image recognition.</p>
<p>Here, AIWin Technology discovered that “quality inspection” is especially critical for realizing AI and image recognition applications. For instance, clients are most focused on product quality control during the shipping process in smart factories; however, many products are still inspected manually. This is not only time consuming, but the accuracy of inspections may be impacted due to personal emotions or fatigue.</p>
<p>The feature of AIWin Technology’s product is helping clients create a “positive cycle” based on AI. Aaron Lin explains that “AI is like a child that requires humans to establish data, clean, and confirm the data before teaching (training) the AI, confirming if what they learned is correct (verification), and allow the AI to continue positive growth by pairing it with on-site staff. Finally, the AI will be developed enough to be deployed in various scenarios and complete missions (inferred).”</p>
<p>For instance, AI can be applied to quality inspection systems in the textiles industry. Previously, flaws in textile fabrics required manual labor to inspect each item. AIWin Technology combines AI technology with cameras so that AI learning systems can “learn” information about flaws and their classification, greatly reducing the burden on manual inspection.</p>
<p>Aaron Lin states that AIWin’s exclusive AI recognition technology has an accuracy of up to 95%. It can accurately recognize more than 6 types of flaws and defects with a speed of up to 25 m/min and optical accuracy of 0.14mm/pixel as well as quickly establish a sample data system. With machine support, smart factories can complete their tasks with more accuracy and efficiency, saving labor time by 30-50%.</p>
<p>AIWin Fabric AI-AOI can achieve up to 95% accuracy</p>
<p>TMYTEK: mmWave Startup Enters the 5G Fray</p>
<p>TMYTEK is a rare startup in the field of 5G mmWave. With the high technology thresholds of mmWave as well as massive competitors such as Qualcomm, how does a tiny startup find an entry point?</p>
<p>“What are the problems requiring solutions of mmWave in mobile communications? What is the industry lacking?” The company’s President, Su-Wei Chang, states that their passion allowed them to identify the demand for 5G development tools and production line testing, resulting in the development of 3 mmWave solutions.</p>
<p>Su-Wei Chang introduced the BBox (Beamforming Box) as the world’s first and only mmWave antenna system development kit; XBeam is an over-the-air (OTA) testing solution that replaces traditional mechanical scanning with digital scanning that performs at test speeds more than 20 times faster than current instruments and can test or analyze mmWave properties. Additionally, UD Box has broader applications, allowing operators to convert the up-down converters from 3G/4G era into high frequency mmWave from research and development to the end of the production line to greatly reduce the implementation costs of equipment for painless 5G upgrades.</p>
<p>TMYTEK provides in-house developed solutions from R&amp;D and design to testing; manufacturing is handled by their domestic partners. Su-Wei Chang mentions that TMYTEK was planned to be fabless from the start, “Taiwan doesn’t lack manufacturers, but companies such as TMY with expertise in design and integration are rare. That’s why we hope to work closely with Taiwan’s 5G ecosystem to create synergy that exceeds 1+1&gt;2.”</p>
<p>They completed their latest round of fundraising in September and TMYTEK expects to reach 400 million in capital. They have successfully attracted investments from many partners and successfully integrated their ecosystem; their next step is to enter the network structure supply chains of telecom companies and look to expand into international markets.</p>
<p>TMYTEK aims to release the 5G RU AiP module in 2021 to complete the last piece of their product lineup.</p>

<h3 id="building-value-in-the-old-economy-alderman-raises-more-capital-adds-new-leader-combines-holding-company">&ldquo;Building value in the &lsquo;old economy&rsquo;: Alderman raises more capital, adds new leader, combines holding company&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.timesfreepress.com/img/photos/2020/10/22/1603383050_102520d01_alderman003_gs_t1070_hba78eb778dd6b74a4a32c46d56ad50eb1205cea7.jpg" alt="img">
Five years ago, a trio of University of Virginia graduates founded a private equity firm in Chattanooga to &ldquo;buy and grow companies the right way, with the right people, for the long term.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Named after former University of Virginia President Edwin Alderman who helped transform the school a century ago, Alderman Holdings has made four business acquisitions in the past four years and still owns three of the local companies. Unlike many other new venture capital funds focused on buying and selling successful startups or tech firms or equity firms eager to find quick turnaround opportunities, Alderman focuses on buying and investing in established &ldquo;old economy&rdquo; companies in the Chattanooga area that can be successful over the long term.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of investment firms are chasing high-growth startups and emerging tech firms, but there is still a tremendous opportunity, and often better values, from established, successful businesses that aren&rsquo;t as big as what a lot of equity firms are focused upon but still have a great, long-term opportunity and returns,&rdquo; said Ben Brown, a former CEO of SwiftWing Ventures and chief operating officer for American Exchange who was one of the Alderman founders. &ldquo;We still see a lot of opportunity in the Chattanooga market, especially with the aging of many Baby Boomer owners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brown said Alderman&rsquo;s business approach has proved successful, even though it initially took some time to find the right businesses to acquire. Despite the ongoing challenges of the coronavirus pandemic, Brown sees even more opportunities ahead to add to the company&rsquo;s portfolio.</p>
<p>Alderman, which has worked to grow on the successes of the local industrial supply businesses it has acquired in Chattanooga, has made some changes of its own this year. Two of the original Alderman partners, Andrew Kean and Jay Hildebrand, left the firm and have been replaced by a new partner.</p>
<p>Company at a glance Name: Alderman Enterprises Formed: 2015 Principals: Ben Brown and Chris Wright Holdings: Southeastern Tool &amp; Design acquired in 2016, Dal Industries bought in 2018, and Edwin Bohr Electronics acquired last year. Alderman also bought Majestic Stone in 2016 but sold that business last year. Location: Alderman Enterprises operates from the Volunteer Building in downtown Chattanooga and all of its business holdings so far are located in Chattanooga Website: <a href="http://www.aldermanenterprises.com">www.aldermanenterprises.com</a></p>
<p>Chris Wright, who previously worked on mergers and acquisitions at Oaklyn Consulting in Chattanooga and New Capital Partners in Birmingham, Alabama, joined Alderman this fall as the company president. Wright, a Baylor school and Yale University graduate, returned to Chattanooga in 2015 after working for equity firms in Birmingham. He spent the past five years working with more than 70 clients at Oaklyn Consulting helping to buy and sell companies. But Wright said he was always eager to be involved in ongoing businesses.</p>
<p>And while many of his peers are chasing high-tech or startup ventures, Wright sees opportunities in smaller, traditional businesses that still have growth opportunities in manufacturing, distribution and sales.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old businessman grew up working in his father&rsquo;s business, Thurman-Bryant Electric Supply, which Wright helped sell five years ago. Wright said the experience of driving forklifts and working in a warehouse at a young age taught him both the value of hard work and the value of industrial supply and other &ldquo;old economy&rdquo; firms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are unique in the size, area and type of businesses that we are targeting,&rdquo; Wright said. &ldquo;While most equity firms are less interested in these type of businesses, we see real long-term value and stability from these type of companies and being here in Chattanooga we are able to work to help them adapt and grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alderman also moved this year to consolidate its holdings under a single board to oversee each of the separate companies. That unified approach across different businesses should facilitate more synergy among the businesses and also provide greater stability and lesser risk to investors than separate funds for each company in the Alderman portfolio. To reflect that change, the company was recently renamed from Alderman Holdings to Alderman Enterprises.</p>
<p>The strategy has helped the company to raise more capital to make additional acquisitions, Brown said. Thanks to a strong response, Brown said Alderman exceeded its fundraising target.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coupled with new investor backing and the distinctive Alderman investment strategy, I can&rsquo;t imagine being in a better position for the years ahead,&rdquo; he said.</p>

TipRanks</p>
<p>Markets have shown two themes in recent weeks, a combination of uncertainty and an upward trend. Day to day, it’s impossible to predict just what will happen, but the larger scale movement has been upwards. Looking ahead, all we know is that current events will reinforce the uncertainty.Earnings season has started. As the market’s publicly traded companies report their Q3 results, we’ll get a clearer idea as the nature of the economic recovery. Q1 was a disaster, the second quarter was better than expected; while Q3 is also expected to beat the expectations, no one will be surprised if it belly flops. So far, our first hint was the September jobs report, which fell short of the forecast but nevertheless showed some 661,000 new jobs last month.The big wild card, of course, is the national election, now just weeks away. President Trump is fighting for his political life and the Democrat opposition is fighting to regain control of the levers of government. It’s an environment that practically screams for investors to take protective action for their portfolios. And it’s possible; even in an uncertain time, there are dividend stocks that promise reliable returns and risk mitigation. Using the TipRanks database, we’ve pulled two stocks with Strong Buy ratings and high dividend yields. Wall Street’s analyst corps sees them as ripe for investment returns, while the dividend yield of 9% or better promises relief from today’s low-rate regime. Hoegh LNG Partners (HMLP)Hoegh operates floating gas services, including storage facilities and regasification units that can act as LNG import terminals in the absence of shore-based infrastructure.Late this past summer, Hoegh announced a new CEO, part of a normal transition of leadership in the company. The remarkable aspect was that the transition occurred during the COVID outbreak – and that the company showed positive revenues and earnings during that time, avoiding the heavy losses that have plagued some of its competitors. Hoegh’s EPS has varied quarter to quarter over the past two years, but the Q2 numbers were in-line with the long-term average, and the Q3 outlook, to be reported next month, is in the same range.Steady earnings usually mean a steady dividend, and HMLP delivers. The company has a 6-year history of dividend reliability, and the payment, of 44 cents per common share, has been held stable through 2020. The $1.76 annualized payment gives an impressively high yield of 15.5%. This is more than 7x the average found among S&amp;P listed dividend payers.Liam Burke, of B. Riley FBR, counts himself as a fan. He writes, “Despite near-term decline in global LNG consumption caused by the coronavirus, there is solid underlying demand for LNG, which is estimated to grow by more than 3% to 5% annually until 2030, which sets the stage for consistent demand for high return floating storage and re-gasification units (FSRU) beyond current contract periods. We continue to believe in the long-term strength of the LNG market and HMLP&rsquo;s underlying charters despite the inherent counter-party risks created by a near-term decline in LNG consumption related to COVID-19.”Burke rates HMLP shares a Buy, and his $17 price target indicates confidence in a 45.5% upside potential. (To watch Burke’s track record, click here)Overall, Wall Street has given HMLP 3 Buys and 1 Hold recently, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target is $13.67, suggesting a 19% upside from the current trading level of $11.41. (See HMLP stock analysis on TipRanks)Hess Midstream Operations (HESM)Next up on today’s list of dividend champs is Hess Midstream, a player in the US oil and gas industry. Hess provides infrastructure services for gathering, processing, storing, and transporting both crude oil and natural gas products in the Bakken formation of North Dakota.Production companies have kept the product flowing despite the coronavirus, which is one reason for the low prices in the oil markets – but it has also kept the midstreamers in demand. Hess has benefited from the continuing need for its technical knowledge of pipeline network, and the result has been that, while much of the oil industry had to retrench recently, Hess saw only modest losses in revenues while earnings remained in-line with their 2-year recent history. Second Quarter EPS was 29 cents; that was lower than Q1, but higher than 4Q19.Hess has turned its steady earnings to shareholders’ advantage, with a dividend that has been increased every quarter for the past 2 years. The last payment, sent in August, was 44 cents per common share. This gave a yield of 9.86%, strong by any standard.JPMorgan analyst Tarek Hamid says of Hess, “The unique pricing model underpinning core profitability remains unmatched and further helps to eliminate (to an extent) DAPL uncertainty overhang relative to peers. Longer-term growth prospects could come in the form of asset level acquisitions and potentially a framework tied to Hess’s GOM position, but management has conveyed a conservative approach with respect to corporate M&amp;A… HESM will burn cash this year, though our modeling indicates a flip to FCF generation in FY21 on lower capital intensity and higher y/y profitability.”To this end, JPMorgan rates HESM an Overweight (i.e. Buy) along with a $23 price target. This figure suggests a 40% upside for HESM shares in the months ahead.Overall, this stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is supported by 4 Buys and 1 Hold. Shares are selling for $16.46, and the average price target of $19.75 indicates a 20% upside potential.
