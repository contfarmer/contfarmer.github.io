<p>Who is Kristin Scott Thomas?</p>
<p>Kristin Scott Thomas was born May 24, 1960 in Redruth, Cornwall, making her 60 years old.</p>
<p>Acting almost didn&rsquo;t happen for the now critically acclaimed star when she was told she would never be a good enough actress - leading her to leave England at the age of 19 to work as an au pair in Paris.</p>
<p>Kristen went on to study acting while abroad, and was cast opposite pop star Prince in 1986 film Under the Cherry Moon upon graduation.</p>
<p>Her father, Lieutenant Commander Simon Scott Thomas, was a pilot in the Royal Navy&rsquo;s Fleet Air Arm, and died in a flying accident when Kristin was aged just five.</p>
<p>The actress has continued to live in France since she was 19 and it&rsquo;s said that she sometimes considers herself more French than British.</p>

Kristin Scott Thomas reckons Four Weddings is a bit of a âdud (Picture: PA)</p>
<p>Four Weddings And A Funeral pretty much paved the way for the rom-com genre, but it turns out Kristin Scott Thomas didnât think it was all thatâ¦ funny.</p>
<p>The actress, 60, won a BAFTA for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Fiona in the 1994 Hugh Grant classic.</p>
<p>And despite the critical acclaim, Kristin actually thought the whole thing was âa bit of a dudâ when she first watched it.</p>
<p>Speaking on The Graham Norton Show in an episode airing tonight, she admitted: âI thought it was a bit of a dud at first.</p>
<p>âThe only time I saw it I was all by myself in a cinema in Paris where there wasnât anyone to laugh with, and I didnât find the jokes particularly funny.â</p>

<p>She added: âBut then I was then on a plane in days when everyone watched the same film and people were laughing so I thought, âMaybe I am mistaken, maybe itâs quite good.ââ</p>
<p>She played Fiona in the 1994 classic (Picture: Orion Pictures)</p>
<p>The Richard Curtis classic features onscreen lovers Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell as well as Simon Callow and Rowan Atkinson.</p>
<p>Kristin also touched on her role as stern housekeeper Ms Danvers in the new Netflix adaptation of Daphne du Maurierâs novel Rebecca.</p>
<p>The English Patient star admitted she relished playing such a downright scary character.</p>
<p>âI had no idea I was so frightening,â Kristin said.</p>
<p>âI couldnât understand when people kept saying, âKristin Scott Thomas, sheâs a bit frightening,â and it turns out she is! I did enjoy it â it was great fun.â</p>

From Digital Spy</p>
<p>Four Weddings and a Funeral might be considered a classic of the rom-com genre but one of its stars Kristin Scott Thomas has revealed that she originally didn&rsquo;t think it was all that funny.</p>
<p>The actress won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her role as Fiona in the 1994 classic, which also starred Hugh Grant, Andie MacDowell, Simon Callow and Rowan Atkinson and featured such famous lines as, &ldquo;Is it still raining? I hadn&rsquo;t noticed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But while appearing on The Graham Norton Show tonight (October 23), Scott Thomas confesses that when she first watched the film all the way through she &ldquo;thought it was a bit of a dud at first&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only time I saw it I was all by myself in a cinema in Paris where there wasn&rsquo;t anyone to laugh with, and I didn&rsquo;t find the jokes particularly funny,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But then I was then on a plane in days when everyone watched the same film and people were laughing so I thought, &lsquo;Maybe I am mistaken, maybe it&rsquo;s quite good&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The actress returned to her role as Fiona for 2019&rsquo;s Comic Relief sequel, One Red Nose Day and a Wedding, which saw characters played by Lily James and Alicia Vikander tie the knot.</p>
<p>A US miniseries based on the film also debuted on Hulu in summer 2019, created by Mindy Kaling and starring Game of Thrones actress Nathalie Emmanuel, so the movie&rsquo;s legacy has certainly lived on.</p>
<p>Scott Thomas also spoke about her role as formidable housekeeper Mrs Danvers in the new Netflix adaptation of Daphne du Maurier&rsquo;s novel Rebecca, joking that she didn&rsquo;t know she could be so scary.</p>

<h3 id="kristin-scott-thomas-says-fleabag-cameo-was-happiest-ive-ever-been">&ldquo;Kristin Scott Thomas says &lsquo;Fleabag&rsquo; cameo was &lsquo;happiest I&rsquo;ve ever been&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kristin-Scott-Thomas-2000x1270-1.jpg" alt="img">
Kristin Scott Thomas has revealed that her one-episode turn in Fleabag was âprobably the happiestâ moment of her career.</p>
<p>The actress, who is promoting her new Netflix film Rebecca, told NME in a video interview that she was âreally, really pleasedâ Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge called her up for a role.</p>
<p>âI was a huge Fleabag fanâ¦I thought itâs a work of total genius,â Thomas told NME. So when she wrote to me to ask me to do it, I think that was probably the happiest Iâve ever been.â</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Thomas portrayed Belinda in season two episode three of Fleabag, which aired last year. Belinda is a successful businesswoman who meets Fleabag (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) at an awards ceremony presented by Fleabagâs sister, Claire. The pair have a profound conversation at a bar about female pain.</p>
<p>The actress plays Mrs Danvers in Rebecca, a new adaptation of Daphne du Maurierâs romantic thriller, directed by Ben Wheatley.</p>
<p>In a three-star review of the movie, NMEâs Alex Flood wrote: âmediocrity is this Netflix murder mysteryâs greatest crimeâ, adding that the modern remake is âfrustratingly fine â and when there are so many other, better versions of this story available [itâs] not quite good enough.</p>
<p>âWith five films, seven TV shows and a host of radio dramas out there already, Rebecca probably doesnât need another adaptation. Yet remarkably, Daphne du Maurierâs 1938 gothic romance is still popular 80 years after it first found a place on the nationâs bookshelf. Ben Wheatleyâs new Netflix take isnât the best version youâll see, but itâs also not the worst.â</p>
<p>NME also spoke to Rebecca stars Lily James and Armie Hammer in a video interview, which you can watch here.

Dame Kristin Scott Thomas will be seen making an appearance on The Graham Norton Show on Friday, after being drafted to replace scandal-hit co-star Lily James.</p>
<p>The glamorous actress, 60, sat down for an interview on the BBC show to promote her and 31-year-old Lily&rsquo;s new Netflix film Rebecca, which was released this week.</p>
<p>Her participation on the popular show was cobbled together at the last minute, in the wake of Lily cancelling a string of interviews after she was pictured holidaying with married Dominic West, 51, in Rome.</p>
<p>TV appearance: Dame Kristin Scott Thomas will be seen making an appearance on The Graham Norton Show on Friday, after being drafted to replace scandal-hit co-star Lily James</p>
<p>Kristin made no mention of the scandal as she promoted her new TV adaptation of Daphne du Maurier&rsquo;s Rebecca, and instead spoke about her overbearing housemaid character Mrs Danvers.</p>
<p>She told titular host Graham Norton: &lsquo;I had no idea I was so frightening. I couldnât understand when people kept saying, &ldquo;Kristin Scott Thomas, sheâs a bit frightening,&rdquo; and it turns out she is! I did enjoy it â it was great fun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, something the star was initially less impressed with was her classic 1994 romantic comedy Four Weddings And A Funeral.</p>
<p>Cancelled: Lily James cancelled a string of interviews after she was pictured holidaying with married Dominic West, 51, in Rome</p>
<p>The actress said: &lsquo;I thought it was a bit of a dud at first. The only time I saw it I was all by myself in a cinema in Paris where there wasnât anyone to laugh with, and I didnât find the jokes particularly funny.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But then I was then on a plane in days when everyone watched the same film and people were laughing so I thought, &ldquo;Maybe I am mistaken, maybe itâs quite good.&quot;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kristin will be seen appearing on the show alongside Bruce Springsteen, Matthew McConaughey, Stephen Mangan, comedian Mawaan Rizwan, and singer Sam Smith.</p>
<p>Bruce, joining Graham from his farm in New York State for a chat, and asked about his new album and documentary Letter to You, said: &lsquo;Itâs the first record we (E Street Band) made together in a really long time.</p>
<p>Cosy: Almost two weeks ago, Lily, 31, caused shockwaves around the globe when she was seen getting close with married Dominic, 51, during a trip to Rome</p>
<p>&lsquo;We all got together and cut the record in four or five days. It was very quick, and we sort of did it the old-fashioned way in the sense that everyone played at once and we kept what we got.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Talking more about the band, he explained: &lsquo;Weâve been together for 45 years at least, so itâs a big deal when we get back together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Asked about the documentaryâs retrospective look at the band, the musician said, &lsquo;Itâs interesting to see. Youâll see us doing something 30 years ago and the film will move forward 30 years into the present day, and we are doing the exact same thing!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Imagine meeting a group of friends at 17 and then 50 years later those very same people are the people you are still working with.</p>
<p>Focusing on work: Glamorous actress Kristin made no mention of the scandal as she promoted her new Netflix adaptation of Daphne du Maurier&rsquo;s Rebecca</p>
<p>Frightening figure: The actress said that Mrs Danvers, her character in the film, is &lsquo;frightening&rsquo;</p>
<p>Slow burner: She also told titular host Graham Norton (pictured) that she wasn&rsquo;t initially impressed with her 1994 classic romantic comedy Four Weddings And a Funeral</p>
<p>&lsquo;That only happens in rock and roll music. Itâs a miracle and it happens in no other business or line of work in the world. Itâs a unique set of circumstances and when it works, as it has worked with our band, it is a wonderful thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hollywood screen star Matthew joined the chat from Los Angeles to talk about his new memoir Greenlights.</p>
<p>Talking about the genesis of the tome, he said: &lsquo;Iâve been keeping a diary for 36 years and originally the idea was to see if anything in them was worth sharing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I originally thought it would be a nice little hardback for college kids to put in their back pocket with some aphorisms and aspirations but, as I got deeper into my diaries, stories and life lessons started to come out and they were quite funny.</p>
<p>Promotion: Hollywood screen star Matthew McConaughey joined the BBC chat show from Los Angeles to talk about his new memoir Greenlights</p>
<p>Empire State: Rock legend Bruce Springsteen joined Graham from his farm in New York State for a chat, and spoke about his new album and documentary Letter to You</p>
<p>&lsquo;I noticed over the last 50 years the hardships â the red and orange lights â revealed green light assets for me later in my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In researching his diaries, he revealed a prediction he made in 1992, saying: &lsquo;I made a list of 10 goals in life and number eight was &ldquo;Win an Oscar&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is strange because at that time I wasnât even verbally admitting that I wanted to pursue acting. I did more than that in my diary, which was wild â it kind of blew my mind!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sam Smith performed their track Diamonds live in the studio, before joining Graham for a chat, where they were asked if the COVID-19 pandemic had affected the release of their album.</p>
<p>Star: Stephen Mangan was also among the stars who made an appearance on the BBC show</p>
<p>Big roles: The screen star also spoke about new show Portrait Artist of the Year and taking over Graham&rsquo;s role as one of the presenters on Children in Need</p>
<p>Responding, Sam said: &lsquo;Yes, massively. It was going to be called To Die For â not a great title now, so we shifted and changed it to Love Goes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kristin&rsquo;s appearance on The Graham Norton Show comes after Lily finally made her first TV appearance following the Dominic West scandal after pulling out of a series of interviews earlier this week.</p>
<p>The actress failed to address that romantic weekend break in Rome where she was pictured kissing the married The Affair actor, when she appeared on the Jimmy Fallon show on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Jimmy, 46, did not broach the scandalous subject which saw Dominic and his wife Catherine FitzGerald, 49, take part in a bizarre photocall outside their Cotswolds home last week, insisting their &lsquo;marriage was strong&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Show guest: Mawaan Rizwan appeared on the show, talking about his role in Two Weeks to Live</p>
<p>Actress Lily pulled out of a press junket with just 45 minutes and no explanation the day after she was pictured with Dominic.</p>
<p>Lily caused shockwaves around the globe when she was seen getting close with married Dominic during a trip to Rome on October 11, before he insisted all was well in his marriage.</p>
<p>Lily and Dominic both star in an upcoming BBC series together and they recently enjoyed a two-day vacation in Italy where they were seen riding on a scooter through Rome.</p>
<p>Dominic appeared at one point to lean over and kiss Lily&rsquo;s neck and they reportedly put on a cosy display during their British Airways flight home.</p>
<p>Musical guest: Singer Sam Smith served as the musical guest on the long-running chat show</p>
<p>The day after Lily and Dominic&rsquo;s cosy pictures emerged, the actress pulled out of the interview, with a source telling Page Six: &lsquo;It was a two-day junket.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the first day, Lily was joined by the producers who it seemed were there to protect her from anyone asking questions about the photos.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The next day, when members of the HFPA and others were due to talk to her, she pulled out at the 11th hour. There was no explanation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lily&rsquo;s last minute decision to pull out sparked a wave of cancellations, as she then scrapped planned appearances on Friday&rsquo;s instalment of The Graham Norton Show and Monday&rsquo;s Today show in America.</p>
<p>Change of title: Talking about their planned album, Sam said, &lsquo;It was going to be called To Die For â not a great title now, so we shifted and changed it to Love Goes&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dapper: The star cut a dapper figure in a smart tuxedo, which they teamed with a plain dark top</p>
<p>A press release sent out by The Graham Norton Show&rsquo;s representatives stated that Lily&rsquo;s Rebecca co-star Kristin Scott Thomas will feature instead, confirming: &lsquo;Lily James will appear on the show at a later date.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Mamma Mia! star was set to appear on NBC&rsquo;s Today show to promote her new Netflix drama Rebecca alongside her co-star Armie Hammer, 34, on Monday.</p>
<p>However, both the actress, who stars as the lead in the Daphne Du Maurier adaptation, and Armie are pulled out of the show over the weekend.</p>
<p>She has since appeared on a BBC podcast giving a playful interview with her Rebecca co-star Armie, yet although it was released on Monday, it is not known exactly when it was filmed.</p>
<p>MailOnline has representatives for Lily James for comment.</p>
<p>The reports come after Lily and Dominic who, both star in an upcoming BBC series together, enjoyed a two-day vacation in Italy where they were seen riding a scooter through Rome, and Dominic appeared to at one point lean over and kiss Lily&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>A source told MailOnline Dominic and Lily spent two nights in a suite at the top Hotel De La Ville with a panoramic view over the city and just at two minutes walk from the Spanish steps.</p>
<p>They only left the hotel for a few hours riding an electric scooter around the Spanish Steps and Piazza di Pietra. While for lunch they joined their friend and mutual manager Angharad Wood at a downtown restaurant.</p>
<p>At the end of lunch Lily sat next to Dominic couldn&rsquo;t resist nuzzling her neck and stroking her.</p>
<p>Out: Lily, shown in her Netflix film Rebecca with Armie Hammer, recently pulled out of a press junket with just 45 minutes and no explanation the day after she was pictured with Dominic</p>
<p>Dominic and Lily were then spotted putting on a very cosy display by &lsquo;kissing and cuddling&rsquo; during their British Airways flight gome, it has been claimed.</p>
<p>They were pictured wearing face masks as they made their way through the Rome terminal to catch their UK-bound flight.</p>
<p>A source has claimed that the pair wasted no time in kicking off their romantic weekend and were &lsquo;all over each other&rsquo; while travelling, reports The Sun.</p>
<p>A source told the publication: &lsquo;At first, I thought she was his daughter, as I knew he was around 50 and you could tell she was a lot younger. Within minutes of the plane leaving, they began kissing and cuddling after both removed their masks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They looked like a couple heading for a dirty weekend and they were all over each other. They were French kissing and there was a lot of necking going on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dominic is best known for playing Noah Solloway in Showtime drama, The Affair, which explores the emotional effects of an extramarital relationship between his character and a younger woman, named Alison Bailey (Ruth Wilson).</p>
<p>Since the pictures of Dominic and Lily in Rome came to light, he has put on a defiant display with his wife Catherine.</p>
<p>Just hours after she told friends she was &lsquo;heartbroken&rsquo; over the images, which went viral, Catherine agreed to take part in a bizarre show of unity with The Affair star, with him telling reporters: &lsquo;Our marriage is strong and we&rsquo;re very much still together&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Cosy: A source claimed they put on a very cosy display by &lsquo;kissing and cuddling&rsquo; during their British Airways flight to Rome, it has been claimed (pictured together at the airport)</p>
<p>The mother-of-four gingerly stepped out of the marital home in Chippenham, Wiltshire, on October 12 with her husband, hiding her ring finger in her jeans pocket.</p>
<p>With fixed smiles planted on their faces, he and Catherine handed photographers a piece of paper, which repeated the words in his handwriting: &lsquo;Our marriage is strong and we&rsquo;re very much still together&rsquo;, with their signatures placed underneath.</p>
<p>The previous Thursday, it was announced that Lily had split from The Crown star Matt Smith, 37, for good after a failed attempt to rekindle their relationship in lockdown following an on-off five year romance.</p>
<p>Lily and Dominic are set to star in Emily Mortimer&rsquo;s adaptation of Nancy Mitford&rsquo;s celebrated novel The Pursuit Of Love for the BBC featuring Emily Beecham &amp; Andrew Scott and filming began in July.</p>
<p>Married: Since the pictures of Dominic and Lily in Rome came to light, he has put on a defiant display with his wife Catherine, telling reporters: &lsquo;Our marriage is strong&rsquo;</p>
<p>The three part romantic comedy-drama about love and friendship is filming on location in the Bristol and Bath area and at The Bottle Yard Studios.</p>
<p>Set in Europe between the two World Wars, the story follows the adventures and misadventures of the charismatic and fearless Linda Radlett, played by Lily and her best friend and cousin Fanny Logan, played by Beecham.</p>
<p>But the pair go way back and starred in Othello together at Sheffield&rsquo;s Crucible back in 2011. Lily played Desdemona when she was 22 and Dominic played Iago, aged 41.</p>
<p>The Graham Norton Show will air on BBC One on Friday at 10.45pm. Also available on BBC iPlayer.

<h3 id="why-kristin-scott-thomas-owes-her-career-to-prince">&ldquo;Why Kristin Scott Thomas owes her career to Prince&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/10/19/2020_10_19_106069_1603089285._large.jpg" alt="img">
Youâd think Anthony Minghella and his breathtaking screen romance The English Patient would immediately come to mind if you ask Kristin Scott Thomas to revisit her past as a newbie actress and take stock of her enviable career in the performing arts.</p>
<p>More than her roles in Four Weddings and a Funeral, Gosford Park and her recent Emmy-nominated turn in Fleabag, it was Minghellaâs sweeping period piece that first drew attention on a global scale to Dame Kristinâs potent allure as a leading lady of immense skills, charm and gravitas.</p>
<p>When we spoke to Kristin last Thursday to discuss her nasty role in director Ben Wheatleyâs visually stunning new version of Daphne du Maurierâs Rebeccaâfirst made into a film 80 years ago via Alfred Hitchcockâs first and only Oscar best picture winnerâwe asked the British actress how far she had evolved as an actress since she appeared in Princeâs 1986 film, Under the Cherry Moon.</p>
<p>After all, we can all agree it isnât every day that Kristinâs name is mentioned alongside that of the Purple One.</p>
<p>To be clear, there were reports that noted Kristinâs alleged âdisdainâ for the aforementioned film. But our interview with her quite softens the blow. In fact, she looked back at her experience with the iconic music superstar with so much sincerity and affection that it unexpectedly tugged at our heartstrings.</p>
<p>âHe [Prince] was an extraordinary person,â Kristin said. âWell, I hope Iâve evolved because Iâm not particularly proud of my performance in that film (laughs). But he was really the first person to give me my first job as an actress in a filmâ¦ He saw something that no one else sawâand didnât see for a while, I have a feeling. So, you know, I am eternally grateful for what he did.</p>
<p>âHe became â¦ I hesitate to say friend, because I didnât know him very wellâ¦ But he was a regular feature in my life. He would contact me when he came to Europe. He would see my work. He would send me messages. I think he was proud of me.</p>
<p>âHe had a certain pride in having been the first person to give me a job, and that makes me proud. We were only 23 when we made that movie. And, you know, life is an endless adventure. So, yeah, I think I have evolved as much as he did since.â</p>
<p>In Rebecca, which launches on Netflix this Wednesday, Kristin plays Mrs. Danni Danvers, the unwelcoming housekeeper of the castle-like Manderley mansion, owned by widower Maxim de Winter (Armie Hammer).</p>
<p>Fiercely loyal to Maxâs gorgeous first wife, who reportedly perished in a boating accident, Danvers makes life a living hell for Maxâs awkward and insecure new wife (Lily James).</p>
<p>Despite all the doom and gloom of the story, Kristin, who turned 60 last May, said that she didnât have a hard time shaking off the darkness of the character at the end of each shooting day.</p>
<p>âNot in this case, no, because I was surrounded by people who were playing this as a fantasy,â she explained. âThis is a ghost story set in a most extraordinary environment. We were inventing the storyâOK, no, we were not inventing it because we were merely repeating something that has been done so many times before. But we were creating this world, and it felt like a very defined environment.</p>
<p>âSo, when we came off the set, and particularly with Lily, it was all very relaxed and sweet and friendly and kind. There was a huge disconnect from the world of Manderlay, Mrs. Danvers, Mrs. de Winter and the world of caravans. Our beautiful summerâs day in England was disconnected from all of that.â</p>
<p>Asked to talk about the filmâs overarching themes, Kristin said, âAt the moment, weâre going through a phase where women in general are waking up to the inequalities that are still ragingâand this film highlights that.</p>
<p>âIn the 1930s, women relied on men. To some degree, they still do, but in this version, a woman is able to react and kick back against it. Whereas in the versions before, the same character was less conscious of those differences.</p>

<p>Our Q&amp;A with Kristin:</p>
<p>Your body of work features a long string of dramas. Is the adjustment in acting different from when you take part in a gothic horror piece like Rebecca?</p>
<p>Itâs very much the same mindset, youâre just evolving in a different environment. I really enjoyed the theatricality of it, and some of the drama of it was very exciting for me. I also very much enjoyed the visual elements of the film.</p>
<p>I had no reservations all about the role. In fact, I had been emailing the producer about it when I heard that this was going to be made into a film, saying, âYou know, you have to hire me because I have to play Mrs. Danvers. I hesitate to say, âI am Mrs. Danvers,â because that would be very unpleasant (laughs). They didnât ask me for a very long time. Then, eventually, my agent rang me up and said, âYes, you got the offer.â I said, âAh, at last!ââ</p>
<p>Why is Mrs. Danvers faithful to Maximâs first wife, Rebecca, almost to the point of obsession?</p>
<p>Because she started to look after Rebecca when she was a little girl. She watched her grow up, she had this incredible maternal relationship with this girl. She adored her from when she was tiny, then watched Rebecca become a teenager, then a young woman, then a married woman. She could see no wrong in whatever she did. She was blinded by love. So, thatâs what it is.</p>
<p>She herself has all sorts of frustrations as a woman. Sheâs unfulfilled, which comes across very strongly in both the novel and our screenplayâsomebody whoâs only lived for Rebecca and was given nothing back. In the end, Rebecca dies, then this other girl arrives. The disappointment, anger and jealousy are the ones driving her.</p>
<p>Weâve all met people like Mrs. Danvers, who take pleasure in making others feel insignificant. Sheâs probably overcompensating for the fact that she ended up as a housekeeper â¦ when she could have been lady of the house. Sheâs had a huge collapse in her statusâand thatâs when she takes it out on other people. Sheâs a bully!</p>
<p>The film has been reworked several times already. How will this new version stand out from the rest?</p>
<p>Weâre banking very much on the ghostly atmosphere of it. Itâs also very different visuallyâitâs extremely rich and beautiful. In the 2020 version, weâre expressing more strongly the frustration that is implied in the novel â¦ of being born female and of having to simply rely on the presence or absence of a man.</p>
<p>In Mrs. Danversâ case, itâs the latter, because nobody really knows what happened to Mr. Danvers, although presumably there was one. He must have died in the first World War. So many women of that generation in that age group lost their partners, husbands, brothers or fathers in the war. So she is manless.</p>
<p>Being manless in those days made life extremely difficult for many women. Now we can see that more clearly. We have a better distance from it, so weâre able to consider it and weigh up what that actually meansâI think thatâs where this film differs from other remakes.</p>
<p>Your version of Mrs. Danvers is scarier than the original because of the element of ambiguityâthereâs a sinister nature that isnât as obviously depicted. We feel that the stakes are high, but we donât quite know what sheâs up to. Was it a conscious decision on your part to veer away from how she was first portrayed?</p>
<p>The only conscious decision we made that veered away from the original version was with my hairdo. Because I wanted much of all that hair away, and we thought it looked too much like the hair worn by Judith Anderson (who played Mrs. Danvers in the Hitchcock film).</p>
<p>But then, the one that really scared me personally was the version of Anna Massey, who portrayed Mrs. Danvers in the BBC miniseries in 1979âthat was really scary! So, it wasnât difficult for me to sort of move away from that.</p>
<p>You know, the part is so rich. And when you have a very few scenes in which to nail something, you have to be very preciseâwhich is what I like doing.</p>
<p>What does the audience take away from watching the film?</p>
<p>Donât hold on to the past, I think thatâs the message [laughs]. Let it go. Otherwise, things will come to a sticky endâbecause Mrs. Danvers is the absolute example of somebody clinging to a memory, to something that doesnât exist. Itâs very unhealthy.

<h3 id="kristin-scott-thomas-on-the-foul-woman-shes-been-waiting-to-play">&ldquo;Kristin Scott Thomas on the &lsquo;foul&rsquo; woman she&rsquo;s been waiting to play&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://e3.365dm.com/20/10/1600x900/skynews-rebecca-lily-james_5143440.jpg?20201019141919" alt="img">
Kristin Scott Thomas has told Sky News she was so keen on her latest role that she was surprised it wasn&rsquo;t offered to her immediately.</p>
<p>The Oscar-nominated star plays Mrs Danvers in the new adaptation of the Daphne du Maurier classic Rebecca, and says it&rsquo;s a part she has been waiting to play.</p>
<p>Image: Lily James (right) plays the newly married Mrs de Winter, while Scott Thomas is housekeeper Mrs Danvers</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely, in fact, when I heard that it was being made, I immediately rang my agents and said I didn&rsquo;t understand, they&rsquo;re making Rebecca and they haven&rsquo;t asked me? So I had to chase a little bit, but I got it in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Rebecca, the newly married Mrs de Winter, played by Lily James, arrives at her husband&rsquo;s home to find housekeeper Mrs Danvers is dedicated to keeping the memory of his first wife alive - no matter the cost.</p>
<p>The character is manipulative and cruel, and Scott Thomas revealed she did draw inspiration from some real people - &ldquo;certain teachers at school, maybe the odd air hostess&rdquo; - she has encountered.</p>

<p>Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Lily James: It&rsquo;s a modern dilemma to feel insecure and inadequate</p>
<p>And while the actress thinks the character is interesting, she doesn&rsquo;t think of her as misunderstood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s pretty horrible, but I think that there&rsquo;s a reason for her horribleness,&rdquo; Scott Thomas says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can either feel sorry for her or not; I&rsquo;m not courting sympathy with this role, but I think there are reasons behind it and I think the reasons are interesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not had the life she was expecting to have. She&rsquo;s Mrs Danvers - we never hear about the husband, but I assume, as there were so many women in this case, that she&rsquo;d lost her husband&hellip; in the First World War, and then had to become governess to this little girl out of necessity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image: Scott Thomas says there is a reason for her character&rsquo;s &lsquo;horribleness&rsquo;</p>
<p>Scott Thomas says that while the gothic novel was written in 1938, it is interesting to look at how women were treated through today&rsquo;s lens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not what she was born to, she was supposed to have a house like the de Winters&rsquo; house, she was supposed to have that at some point and it never happened because she lost everything when she lost the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think that&rsquo;s something that today we&rsquo;re very keen on discussing and talking about - what it&rsquo;s like to be a woman, what it&rsquo;s like to be born female, what it&rsquo;s like to be kind of ruled by men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that is an aspect of the film, aspect to the story that [director] Ben Wheatley has really kind of pointed up, so I think it&rsquo;s great - modern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image: Armie Hammer also stars alongside James</p>
<p>Scott Thomas, known for roles in Four Weddings And A Funeral and The English Patient, is often cast as a woman who initially seems prickly before her softer side is revealed.</p>
<p>While this isn&rsquo;t quite the case for Mrs Danvers, the actress says that perhaps the audience will be most moved by the character at the end of the film.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She really is frantic with grief, her whole life has been dedicated first of all to this girl, Rebecca, and then to the memory of the girl, and then it&rsquo;s all taken away from her and she&rsquo;s got nothing left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she is sort of left in this&hellip; she&rsquo;s got no way out, really, Mrs Danvers, she&rsquo;s abandoned, really, in the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think that&rsquo;s quite touching actually, perhaps the only thing that is really moving about her, because basically she&rsquo;s just foul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rebecca will be available on Netflix from 21 October
