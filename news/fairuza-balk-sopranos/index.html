<h3 id="the-sopranos-legacy-for-tv-new-jersey-and-loose-endings">&ldquo;The Sopranos Legacy for TV, New Jersey, and Loose Endings&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/the-sopranos-ending.jpg?fit=1200%2C900" alt="img">
Martin Scorsese‘s gangster film The Irishman promises to deliver classic cinema to Netflix while the rest of the movie-going public ride marvelous theme park attractions on the big screen. David Chase is doing post-production on The Many Saints of Newark, a film prequel to the series which changed television. The Sopranos premiered on HBO on Jan. 10, 1999, immediately eclipsing the groundbreaking series Sex and the City which debuted only six months before. The crime family saga blurred the lines between cinematic and televised art. It also transformed the way people see New Jersey, a borough of Manhattan, where the show’s most rabid fans gather for SopranosCon, a place where the DiMeo crime family never dies. It doesn’t matter whether Tony Soprano, played by the late James Gandolfini, the head of two Jersey families, got popped at the end by some guy in a Members Only jacket and whacked the rule that every show needs its ends tied up. The Sopranos did for crime on TV what The Godfather did for gangster films: It elevated it to fine art.</p>
<p>In spite of producing classic and influential films like Little Caesar, Public Enemy, Scarface and Dead End, gangster movies were relegated to the genre film ghetto. The films occasionally rose to be works of true onscreen beauty, like High Sierra, White Heat, and Once Upon a Time in America, but the majority of criminal cinema came out as B pictures. Francis Ford Coppola changed that with his adaptation of Mario Puzo‘s bestselling novel The Godfather, getting inside the family of mob royalty. Scorsese took the gangster from the fine lawns of New York’s suburbs, where Don Corleone threw the wedding for his daughter, back to the streets. Low level street hoods ruled Mean Streets and mid-level working capos gave the orders in Goodfellas, based on Nic Pilleggi’s book Wise Guys. Scorsese’s 90s classic paved the way for a glorified crew in New Jersey to think of themselves as a borgata.</p>
<p>David Chase didn’t see The Sopranos as a television series. He saw it as a filmmaking experience. The show featured two main actors from Goodfellas: Lorraine Bracco, who played Dr. Melfi, and Michael Imperioli, who played Christopher Moltisanti. In the opening season Christopher even pays his character’s arc forward to a bit player by shooting him in the foot for making him wait too long for sfogliatelle at a bakery.</p>
<p>Dr. Melfi continues the tradition of Billy Crystal’s character in Analyze This. He gives psychiatric aid to Robert De Niro’s mafia boss character, enabling him to get over his anxieties and become a more effective leader, and a better criminal. While the head doctor in Harold Ramis’ mob comedy doesn’t have too much of an ethical problem with his work, Dr. Melfi agonizes over it until she has to dump her infamous client by the last season. The series also drew talent from Coppola’s classic. Dominic Chianese, who played Johnny Ola, the real reason Fredo got executed in The Godfather Part II, brought gravitas to his role as Tony’s Uncle Junior. By combining aspects of the big screen offerings, The Sopranos made the small screen respectable for what seemed to be the least respectable characters.

<h3 id="watch-ariana-grande-perfectly-play-adam-sandler-in-the-waterboy">&ldquo;Watch Ariana Grande Perfectly Play Adam Sandler in &lsquo;The Waterboy&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/mh-waterboy-split-1-1586450656.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
While social distancing at home, Ariana Grande expertly recreated a scene from Adam Sandler&rsquo;s classic film The Waterboy.</p>
<p>Sandler responded to her recreation, praising the video.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an expertly-made video: the costumes, the make-up, and the details are perfect.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re all starting to dig in and get used to this new normal of social distancing and quarantine—even pop stars and movie stars. Ariana Grande, one of the biggest of the former group, spent a little of her mid-week time recreating a very funny scene from The Waterboy. The movie&rsquo;s star, Adam Sandler (one of the biggest of the latter group) found the time to respond accordingly to her rather detailed and on-point effort.</p>
<p>Grande recreated the scene with Elizabeth Gillies, an actress and her former Victorious costar, playing the role of Vicki Vallencourt, and her own mother, Joan, playing Kathy Bates&rsquo; iconic Mama Boucher role. Also, as you can see in the video, the pop star is setting a good example for her millions of fans—the video has appropriate social distancing in place, as all three participants are clearly in different locations.</p>
<p>The detail to the scene is on-point; Grande has totally recreated Bobby Boucher&rsquo;s ridiculous suit from that point in the movie, and her mother looks on-point as Bates&rsquo; Mama character. Perhaps most of all, Gillies looks like a dead ringer for Vicki Vallencourt (originally played by Fairuza Balk in the 1998 film).</p>
<p>Grande&rsquo;s Tweet, which she captioned &ldquo;another super productive day,&rdquo; has already racked up more than 26 thousand retweets. With her nearly 73 million followers, that&rsquo;s a fairly regular number—but the fan reaction was still overwhelming, with most praising her commitment to the bit, as well as getting her mom to buy in to such a strong degree as well.</p>
<p>For a 22 year old movie, The Waterboy really does hold up extraordinarily well. Maybe it&rsquo;s something about the usually generic category of sports movies—when a movie taking itself seriously feels a little bit square and dated, a movie not afraid to laugh at itself can wind up feeling really refreshing. And in this weird time, comedy is something we&rsquo;re all looking to keep consistent in our diet.</p>

<p>Sandler clearly got wind of the video later in the day, and overnight posted a response to the video, quoting it for his own Tweet. &ldquo;A tough day for Bobby&hellip;Vicki&hellip;and Mama,&rdquo; he wrote. Grande responded to his tweet with a simple heart. Game respect game.</p>

<p>Grande has proven previously to be a ferociously loyal fan of 1990s comedy—last year, she seemed legitimately starstruck after interacting with &rsquo;90s comedy icon Jim Carrey, and even had a guest appearance on the second season of his Showtime series, Kidding.</p>

<h3 id="you-may-have-forgotten-about-these-sopranos-guest-stars">&ldquo;You May Have Forgotten About These ‘Sopranos’ Guest Stars&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sopranos-gaga-feature.png?w=650" alt="img">
The Sopranos is known, of course, for its dynamite cast and its innovative story-telling, but the show (which can be streamed on HBO Now) also had a pretty impressive roster of guest stars who would lend their talents to just a few scattered scenes across no more than an episode or two. Like powdered sugar on a cannoli, these actors are an oft-forgotten but vital part of the show’s revered legacy, so we thought we’d celebrate the best.</p>
<p>J.D. Williams – Special K</p>
<p>Three years before he’d play the role of Barksdale corner man Bodie on The Wire, J.D. Williams made a brief appearance in the second episode of the first season of The Sopranos. It’s more than a blink-and-you-miss-it cameo, though. Williams’ moment of carelessness ends up setting off a series of events that impacts Christopher and Brendan rather severely.</p>
<p>Bookeem Woodbine – Massive Genius</p>
<p>After a night out in the city, Christopher and Adriana cross paths with rap mogul Massive Genius. While they become enamored with his extravagant lifestyle, he takes an interest in the internal workings of the Soprano family, both personal and professional.</p>
<p>Paul Mazursky – Sunshine</p>
<p>The five-time Oscar nominee first appeared as the dealer, Sunshine, for The Executive Game, a high-stakes card game that he “inherits” from his Uncle Junior in season two’s “The Happy Wanderer.” He shows up again in season three’s riveting “Amour Fou,” during a botched robbery attempt.</p>
<p>Frank Sinatra Jr. – Himself</p>
<p>A regular player at The Executive game, he shows his long-standing rapport with Tony’s crew, reassuring fish-out-of-water David Scatino (Robert Patrick in a season-long recurring role), that Paulie is “not just a nasty f<em>ck, he’s an incredibly nasty f</em>ck.” Paulie brushes off the ribbing, referring to Sinatra as “Chairboy of the Board.”</p>
<p>Sully Boyar – Dr. Krakower</p>
<p>After attending therapy sessions with Dr. Melfi, with and without Tony present, Carmela visits a contemporary of hers, Dr. Krakower, who wastes no time telling her under no uncertainty to leave her husband, and that he wouldn’t take payment from her, as he was unwilling to accept “blood money.” As Carmela pleads with him that “he’s a good man, basically,” Krakower snaps back, “you just told me he’s a depressed criminal.” It would end up being Boyar’s final role, as he died of a heart attack just two weeks before the episode aired.</p>
<p>Sam McMurray – Dr. John Kennedy</p>
<p>Junior’s reverence toward his surgeon, Dr. Kennedy, is shaken when he begins avoiding his phone calls after he seeks a second opinion on his stomach cancer. After Tony and Furio make it a point to show him the error of his disrespectful ways, I always liked to imagine this terrified Kennedy so much he enters the Witness Protection Program, assumes a new identity after being relocated to New Mexico before treating Walter White. That or Sam McMurray is just one of the most ubiquitous “that guy” actors out there.</p>
<p>Burt Young – Bobby ‘Bacala’ Baccalieri, Sr.</p>
<p>After having moved to Miami, Bacala’s cancer-stricken father comes back to Jersey to visit his grandkids. Taking advantage of him being back in New Jersey, Tony offers Bacala Sr. a chance to come out of retirement and help take care of a difficult situation. Being that it’s The Sopranos, there are dire consequences as a result.</p>
<p>Charles S. Dutton – Officer Wilmore</p>
<p>Possibly the only traffic cop in all of New Jersey with the gumption to give Tony Soprano a ticket, Officer Wilmore finds his world turned upside down when Tony takes advantage of his local government connections to squeeze him out of his job.</p>
<p>Lady Gaga – A.J.’s classmate</p>
<p>One night, after A.J. and his friends break into the school, things quickly escalate and school records, desks, and trophies all end up underwater. Cheering on the destruction? Lady Gaga in an uncredited appearance as “Girl by the pool #2.”</p>
<p>Isaach De Bankole´ – Father Obosi</p>
<p>Seeking to make a confession, Carmela reveals to the priest that she believes God is punishing her for Tony’s crimes. Obosi, a soft-spoken, thoughtful man of God gives her solace, telling her that God loves her more than she knows, and even speaks to the complexity of the world they live in, enabling her a whole new way to rationalize her living with her husband’s crimes.</p>
<p>Michael K Williams – Ray Ray</p>
<p>Looking for a place to hide out after a botched robbery attempt, Jackie Jr. gets taken in by Ray Ray at a housing project in Boonton. In a clever bit of foreshadowing, as his daughter teaches Jackie Jr. to play chess, Ray Ray looks at the game board at one point telling him bluntly, “Yo, man, I think you done for.”</p>
<p>Fairuza Balk – FBI Agent</p>
<p>Originally cast as FBI Agent Deborah Ciccerone for the season three finale “Army of One,” Balk opted not to return to the role once her character was expanded in the following season, and was recast with Lola Glaudini, who re-shot all of Balk’s scenes for all subsequent DVD and VOD releases.</p>
<p>Tobin Bell – Major Zwingli</p>
<p>Once he’s expelled from high school after cheating on a test, Tony and Carmela look into putting A.J. into military school, which Tony sees as a way of saving him from himself. Bell, best known as Jigsaw from the Saw franchise, gets a pretty good amount of range in the four minutes of screen time he gets as the major of a prestigious military academy. When Carmela explains she doesn’t approve of the school’s approach, his blunt response that “the mothers seldom do” is sublime.</p>
<p>Will Arnett – Agent Mike Waldrup</p>
<p>The husband of Agent Danielle Ciccerone (after she was recast), Arnett appears briefly in a couple of scenes, most notably commenting on how their infant child takes a liking to her big hair, an undercover tactic she’s using to get close to Adriana. It was one of his last dramatic roles, as he was cast as Gob Bluth on Arrested Development two years later.</p>
<p>Paul Dano – Patrick Whalen</p>
<p>A.J.’s pop-culture obsessed friend, Patrick, begins to push him for details into the seedy world that he imagines his father’s life to be.</p>
<p>Bruce Altman – Alan Sapinsly</p>
<p>A wealthy, WASP-y New Englander who enters into business with Tony when he becomes the favored buyer for his shoreside property, Whitecaps. Once circumstances change and Tony tries to back out, though, Alan refuses to pay him back his deposit, insisting it’s his right to withhold it. This leads to a special kind of torment courtesy of Tony, one that involves an old Dean Martin CD played at high volume.</p>
<p>Annette Bening – Herself</p>
<p>One of the show’s high-concept episodes, the majority of the storyline takes place in one of Tony’s dreams, including this bizarre scene where they’re introduced to Meadow’s boyfriend’s parents. The catch: His father is John Heard, who played the gambling addicted cop Vin Makazien in the show’s first season, and his mother is Annette Bening, who Tony recognizes, before she later references a scene from The Godfather.</p>
<p>David Lee Roth – Himself</p>
<p>Another celebrity at a Sopranos family poker game, Roth reminisces fondly of the tax-paying advantages of his rock star life. Namely, how he “used to be able to write off condoms.”</p>
<p>Hal Holbrook – John Schwinn</p>
<p>A former scientist portrayed by Emmy and Tony-winning actor Holbrook, Schwinn begins to discuss the oneness of life through quantum theory while watching a prize fight with Tony in rapper Da Lux’s hospital room.</p>
<p>Daniel Baldwin – Himself</p>
<p>Christopher’s dream project, the low-budget mob/horror movie “Cleaver” finally gets its premiere. After a failed attempt to cast Ben Kingsley, they manage to sign Daniel Baldwin, who ends up starring as the philandering mob boss who was very clearly modeled after Tony.</p>
<p>Sydney Pollack – Warren Feldman</p>
<p>Another Hollywood heavy-hitter who’d lend his talent to the show’s roster, Pollack played a surgeon who committed a series of brutal murders after catching his wife cheating on him. Now reduced to the role of custodian within the prison hospital, he becomes fast friends with Johnny Sack, who’s there himself due to his rapidly advancing cancer.</p>
<p>Nancy Sinatra – Herself</p>
<p>Keeping with his old-school style, Phil Leotardo hires Nancy Sinatra to sing at his party to celebrate him becoming the boss of one of New York’s five families. While many of the show’s characters are there to celebrate along side him, his position at the top sets events in motion that lead to the shows climactic final episodes.

<h3 id="blumhouses-the-craft-remake-casts-its-coven-zoey-luna-gideon-adlon-lovie-simone">&ldquo;Blumhouse’s The Craft remake casts its coven: Zoey Luna, Gideon Adlon, Lovie Simone&rdquo;</h3>

<p>The coven has convened. Blumhouse has revealed the cast of its upcoming remake of The Craft: Zoey Luna, Gideon Adlon, and Lovie Simone. The trio of actresses join Cailee Spaeny (Pacific Rim: Uprising), who was previously announced to star as new-girl-in-school Hannah.</p>
<p>Luna (TV’s Pose), Adlon (Blockers), and Simone (Selah and The Spades) will portray the three young witches who bring Hannah into their flock when she arrives at their Catholic prep school. As the newcomer’s power begins to grow at a surprising rate, they “unleash a power that at first seems to solve problems in their lives but slowly consumes them with unforeseen costs.” (via SlashFilm)</p>
<p>In the cult classic original from 1996, the roles were played by Fairuza Balk, Neve Campbell, and Rachel True, with Robin Tunney as the novice spell-caster Sarah. The diversity of the remake’s cast is already winning praise, especially because it places Luna, who has made a name for herself as a transgender actress and activist, in the top billing of a major Hollywood horror film.</p>

<p>Blumhouse’s The Craft remake is being written and directed by Zoe Lister-Jones (Band Aid, Fawn Moscato in TV’s New Girl). Filming is expected to begin next summer, with no release date yet confirmed.
