<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo dished out a playful dig at his daughter’s boyfriend at the dinner table Sunday night.</p>
<p>“Sunday dinner — Check,’’ the governor wrote in a tweet above a photo of him and his three daughters at the table.</p>
<p>“Meatballs — Check.</p>
<p>“The Boyfriend — ?”</p>
<p>The cutesy jab was just a joke, a Cuomo spokesman later told The Post.</p>
<p>“We like the boyfriend,’’ the rep said, quoting his boss.</p>
<p>The governor was apparently tweaking oldest daughter Mariah’s Norwegian beau, Tellef Lundevall.

The difference between doing the job and just appearing to do the job is rarely absolute. In the more than eight months since COVID-19 manifested in the United States, our public officials have demonstrated pretty much every gradation. Recently, President Donald Trump was ailing at Walter Reed hospital, both a victim and a symbol of his Administration’s lassitude and arrogance in the face of the pandemic. He’d failed to protect the country, and now he’d failed to protect himself—not to mention his staff, his supporters, and perhaps his opponent. Even after he returned to the White House, persistent obfuscations about how long he’d had symptoms and how serious they were called only more attention to the Administration’s negligence and bad faith. He continued to do nothing, and to urge the country, and Congress, to do nothing. Photographs released by the White House on October 3rd, of Trump supposedly working, depicted him using a Sharpie to sign his name on a blank sheet of paper. A boy practicing his autograph.</p>
<p>“It’s all been exposed,” Andrew Cuomo, the Governor of New York, told me recently. “Trump was exposed. The lies are exposed. The incompetence is exposed. It’s like low tide in the ocean. Now the whole shoreline is exposed. There’s no question as to what was under the water.” Cuomo was busy contending with some other new COVID clusters—a dozen or so, many in predominantly Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods in and around New York City. The onset of autumn had brought a surge in viral transmissions and had complicated the delicate task of opening up while keeping numbers down. Last week, Hasidim were out in the streets, angrily protesting the Governor’s abrupt restrictions on religious gatherings in certain communities. In their eyes, he was doing too much, at least to them. Still, most New Yorkers felt that Cuomo had done a commendable and by some measures miraculous job bringing New York back from the brink. The image they’d formed of him, at the height of the pandemic, still pertained.</p>
<p>One can forget the terror of those weeks in the spring, and the devastation of the numbers. A Saturday in April: the confirmed death count, statewide, was five hundred and seven. The days had all started to seem the same, at least to those people fortunate enough to be able to say so. From a distance, what set one morning apart from another was its place on the curve—the tally of new COVID-19 fatalities. On Sunday, from a medical-research center in Manhasset, on Long Island, Cuomo shared this information with the media and the many citizens watching on their screens. For seven weeks, he had been delivering daily briefings, to widespread and in some circles ardent acclaim. The repetitiveness of these performances, the almost liturgical demonstrations of what seemed like good sense, was itself calming, especially in contrast with whatever fresh craziness came out of the White House each night. Cuomo, by leaning on data, brandishing logic, speaking in paragraphs, and expressing something like human feeling, had stepped into the void left by the federal government’s cynical and capricious response. In the land of the incoherent, the silver-tongued man is king.</p>
<p>For the first time, the death rate was at an ebb. “We are on the other side of the plateau, and the numbers are coming down,” Cuomo said. While Joe Biden played possum in his bunker and Trump, in spite of the carnage, maintained some viable wedge of support in the polls, Cuomo was all over TV, with his crisis-time white polo shirt and furrowed brow. He had running themes, which he enunciated with relish: the preference for facts over opinions (his elongation of “facts” giving the word almost another syllable), the idea that the virus had come to New York from Europe rather than from China (his pronunciation of “China” either eerily or mockingly similar to Trump’s), and this concept of “New York tough,” which, as he kept explaining, with the assistance of PowerPoint slides, meant tough not just in the hard-ass way that people might associate with the city (and with him) but also “smart, disciplined, unified, loving.”</p>
<p>Loving! Here was a politician known as a man who doesn’t much like people and whom most people don’t like, at least in the way you might, say, a colleague or a friend. “He was born for social distancing,” a former aide told me. When people thought of him, they pictured a calculating, very capable, somewhat grim tactician, a man of relentless and ill-concealed ambition and intrigue—a mechanic of government, it was usually said, in a nod both to his understanding of the levers of power and to his talent for tinkering with muscle cars. But now the Prince of Darkness (a tag he’d always resisted) was a self-proclaimed “cool dude in a loose mood,” or, as his younger brother, Chris, the CNN correspondent, kidded him during their regular mock interviews, the Love Gov. The comedian Randy Rainbow came out as a “Cuomosexual,” and a new orientation was born. The public snickered about his nipples—or even speculated about nipple rings—visible beneath his white polo, just below the state seal.</p>
<p>“If it were up to the women,” my friend Anna wrote me, “G❤️v Cu❤️m❤️ wld be on all the time. He is, among most of my friends, 🔥.” It could be the voice, which has the timbre and phrasing of his father’s, the way it alights softly on certain plosives, on the letters “P” or “D,” the “S”s becoming “Z”s. The way he intones “LaGuardia” as he claims credit, deservedly, for building its new terminals. Among the fans of the sound of his voice, you’d probably have to include Cuomo himself. “This is a guy who knows he has a moment, and he’s not going to waste it,” a former city official told me.</p>
<p>Throughout the crisis, the Governor, who is sixty-two, had talked a lot about his mother, Matilda, unable to see her grandchildren; about Chris, afflicted by COVID and quarantined, sort of, in his basement in the Hamptons; about his three daughters, Cara, Mariah, and Michaela, who had come to live with him during the quarantine, something he noted so often that anyone who’d been through a divorce might have wondered if he was doing it to nettle the ex-wife. The ex was Kerry Kennedy, a daughter of Bobby and Ethel. “Part of the reason women are going wild for him,” a woman who was going wild for him wrote me one day, “it’s the daughters. They adore him. And he seems to have saved them from the Kennedy curse. He put the iron in their souls.”</p>
<p>On this Sunday, the day after the confirmed deaths of five hundred and seven people, Cuomo eased into one of his familial tangents: “I come from an Italian-American household where we had a great tradition on Sundays—the family had to come together at the table. . . . They called it dinner, but it started at two o’clock in the afternoon—I don’t really know why they called it dinner. But everybody was at the table. Spaghetti and meatballs every Sunday.” Now his daughters were home; he’d already started cooking the sauce. Can you imagine Trump stirring a sauce? Cuomo then summoned the sitcom-dad persona he’d been trying out. “Mariah brought her boyfriend,” he said. “The boyfriend is very nice, and we like the boyfriend. Advice to fathers: the answer of what you think of the boyfriend is always ‘I like the boyfriend.’ Always.”</p>
<p>At this point, Cuomo was, as one longtime antagonist described it to me in the spring, “the boyfriend of all America.” Whether you liked the boyfriend or not, you said you liked the boyfriend. He seemed better than the other guys—the President a maniac, the Mayor a buffoon. But what would happen when people got to know the boyfriend a little better?</p>
<p>Six weeks later, on the final day of May, Cuomo devoted most of his daily briefing to a different subject. COVID deaths in the state had reached a new low of fifty-six, he said, “which is, in this absurd reality we live in, actually very, very good news.” It was. The city was scheduled to begin opening up in a week. But augmenting the absurdity of our reality was the chaos that had broken out the previous nights in cities across the country, including New York, in the wake of the killing of George Floyd. Police had beaten, maced, and mowed down demonstrators and journalists; rioters had looted stores and torched police vehicles. Another night of mayhem loomed. The day before, Cuomo had named some Black victims of police violence in the past three decades, and bemoaned the fact that nothing had changed, that our political leaders had done little to address what he agreed (“Of course!”) was a crisis of systemic racism and state-sanctioned violence against people of color. “I’m with the protesters,” he said.</p>
<p>Now Cuomo had specific fixes in mind: independent investigations of police-abuse charges, transparency with police disciplinary records. His voice had attained that higher, singsong pitch it sometimes does when he is strenuously insisting on something, in this case the failure of the political establishment to fix the relationship between the community and the police and, more broadly, the long-standing inequities between white and Black, rich and poor, in education, housing, and health services. It was an impassioned call from a mainstream Democrat for a new progressivism, which he depicted as long overdue.</p>

<p>These were stirring words, but, to people who’d been paying attention to Cuomo, they came with some dissonance. And not just because the next day he announced, with Mayor Bill de Blasio, a curfew for New York City, the first in seventy-five years, and a surge in the deployment of police, or because, in the nights ahead, the police went on a spree of violence against peaceful protesters. It was almost as if he were calling himself out. If Cuomo wasn’t the political establishment, who was? He was approaching the midpoint of his third term; he’d been governor for almost ten years. Before that, he’d been the New York attorney general, and, well before that, in the eighties, a top adviser to his father, Mario, during his three terms as governor, and, in the nineties, Bill Clinton’s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Though Cuomo lamented that many of his progressive efforts had been undone by politics—“I am perpetually frustrated about how hard it is to get that political machine, that governmental machine, to turn. It’s like a big freighter coming down the river”—he seemed to be describing an agenda that he, for most of his time as governor, had often quietly done his best to thwart. Frequently, it was he who kept the freighter steaming straight ahead.</p>
<p>The latest crisis drew new attention to the quandary of Cuomo: the Cuomo people see on TV and the Cuomo people contend with behind closed doors. Such incongruities are almost universal in politics and government, but there’s something particularly fraught about Cuomo’s contradictions—the promise that comes with such power and political skill versus the bitter fruit it can bear.</p>
<p>Even before the death of George Floyd (Mr. Floyd, as Cuomo almost always refers to him), the public perception of the Governor’s handling of the pandemic, in many quarters, had started to adjust. As eloquent as he was, as competent as he’d seemed, his state had suffered arguably the world’s worst outbreak, with a staggering number of deaths and hospitalizations. Much of this could be ascribed to the density and inequity of New York City, along with its airports, which served as the main ports of entry for flights arriving from the most infected regions of Europe. Cuomo reminded everyone that the virus had ambushed us precisely because the federal government had paid it such scant attention. But even if one allowed for the fog of war, and the pieties of hindsight, many of the moves Cuomo made in the earliest days of the pandemic were indicative of a governing style often hampered by political calculation and personal pique.</p>
<p>People came after him either for overreacting or for underreacting. The overreaction critique came mostly from the right, from the open-it-up-ers, who felt that a statewide shutdown, and the Governor’s dire requests for forty thousand ventilators, had been excessive, a product of hysteria and a desire to undermine Trump. This was easy to parry. Cuomo credibly made the case that the ventilator and I.C.U. predictions had been based on worst-case models issued or endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control and other public-health authorities. He’d deferred to the scientists, as the Trump Administration kept failing to do. And the shutdown did flatten the curve, greatly diminishing fatalities and hospital overload. In a pandemic, you hope to be accused, afterward, of having overreacted.

Celebrity chef Sandra Lee has sold the Northern Westchester home she shared for several years with her former boyfriend, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, according to a new report.</p>
<p>The home, at 4 Bittersweet Lane in New Castle, sold for $1.85 million after originally being listed for $2 million, The New York Post reports.</p>
<p>Lee bought the home, called Lily Pond, in for $1.3 million in 2009. She moved to a new home, located in Malibu, California, late last year, shortly after the 54-year-old Lee and 62-year-old Cuomo confirmed their split in September 2019.</p>
<p>“Over the recent past, we have realized that our lives have gone in different directions and our romantic relationship has turned into a deep friendship,” the two said in a joint statement issued Wednesday afternoon, Sept. 25.</p>
<p>“We will always be family and are fully supportive of each other and dedicated to the girls,” they said, referring to Cuomo’s three daughters from his marriage to Kerry Kennedy. “Our personal lives remain personal and there will be no further comment.”</p>

<p>Ten months since China acknowledged the first outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan, and seven months since the WHO declared it a global pandemic, there’s nowhere on the planet that’s been hit harder than New York State, where almost 33,000 people have died, most of them during a terrifying surge in March and April. This week, Governor Andrew Cuomo publishes American Crisis: Leadership Lessons From the COVID-19 Pandemic. And while that may look to New Yorkers like the height of chutzpah — the guy who presided over a period of historic suffering and unparalleled death putting out a self-lionizing memoir — it’s not as presumptuous a gambit as it at first seems. Through the spring and summer, as President Trump essentially ignored the coronavirus, Cuomo played a kind of alternate-reality president for information-hungry liberals nationwide, scrambling to expand state hospital and testing capacity and delivering daily televised press conferences tracing the course of the disease and what we knew about it, which helped make him, in time, the second-most-trusted American voice on the pandemic, behind Dr. Anthony Fauci. We spoke in early October, when a small rise in cases was beginning to appear, as had been forecast since the start of the pandemic, and the presidential campaign was taking what seemed like a decisive turn away from Trump, Cuomo’s frequent pandemic sparring partner. The governor was in alternately combative and reflective moods. “Trying to make sense of it all,” he said, when I asked how he was doing. “Trying to make sense of it.”</p>
<p>How scared are you of the fall? How scared should we be?</p>
<p>Nobody knows. But what the scientists have always said is “Beware of the fall.” This is sort of like dealing with the tides in the ocean; when there is high tide and there is low tide, you are going to be subjected to the tide. Do I anticipate a high tide? Yes. But everything we’ve seen so far, we’re in better shape than every other state, and we are better prepared.</p>
<p>And in New York, we are a function, in part, of what’s going on in the rest of the nation. We have this quarantine against 34 states, but in truth, it’s water through a screen. I can’t stop people and truckers coming in from other parts of the country. I can’t stop people from flying into airports; that’s all federal. So if there are infections in Florida and Texas, that’s going to hurt us here. We have a cluster problem, but if the fall tide increases because people are going indoors, because there’s less outdoor activity, because people are going to schools … We see it in colleges, certainly. And we will see it in schools.</p>
<p>You’re pretty clear about that.</p>
<p>Schools, no matter how well you do it, there will be transmission in schools. But we now do 120,000 tests a day. That’s our highest point ever. The highest per capita on the globe. Testing is the one smart, definitive function that you can perform. And we do more faster, and better, frankly, because I was so desperate for quantifiable, hard information for so long. There were so many weeks where every expert said, “Well, I’m not sure, but I think …” Nobody knew anything. The only thing you knew was what the data showed, and that’s why we were so aggressive in setting up the data.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask you about community protection — some people use the term herd immunity, but in a way that is misleading. There are those who believe New York City in particular has had enough of the disease spread that future transmission will be slowed by previous exposure. Do you put any trust in that? Or do you think we’re still vulnerable to the kind of exponential rate of increase we saw earlier in the spring?</p>
<p>Herd immunity is 50, 60 percent. You’re at 20 percent in New York City. That’s the Rand Paul versus Anthony Fauci argument. And Paul was just wrong. It’s just math.</p>
<p>Twenty percent is a lot of exposure. So why was it so bad here? You were criticized for moving too slowly, but you went from the first confirmed case to announcing a shutdown in 19 days — much faster than the West Coast states. You had inadequate testing capacity, but so did everyone else in the country. You didn’t really have a contact-tracing program — no state program and just 50 disease detectives in New York City, compared with 9,000 at the peak of the crisis in Wuhan — but neither did anyone else. There were some noncompliance issues with masks and social distancing, but that was true everywhere. And yet New York just had a dramatically worse epidemic than any other state in the country. In fact, worse than anywhere else in the world. Why did New York get hit so hard?</p>
<p>It’s mass. You have more infected people coming here for a longer period of time. See, when you say it’s in China — okay, how many people are coming here from China? The number of people coming from Europe is much higher. Those flights were coming for two months before anyone said anything. Nobody said, “Beware of people coming from Italy and from Spain and from France.” They did the China travel ban January 31. The big miss was the disease had already left China. It was in Europe. The European travel ban, March 13 — that was ten weeks late.</p>
<p>And they didn’t even really close the door on China, because they let all the American nationals who had been there return.</p>
<p>True. But at least we did something January 31. That’s why the president keeps talking about January 31. “I did the China ban January 31.” Yeah. What he doesn’t want to say is “But the virus came to New York, and most of this country, from Europe.” And you didn’t do the European ban until mid-March.</p>
<p>Do you think it would have been politically feasible for Trump to enact a global travel ban as early as late January?</p>
<p>Oh, I think he would have done it. I think they didn’t know.</p>
<p>What else could have been done?</p>
<p>The first point about COVID, I think, and the transcendent point, is it’s shown our nation’s lack of capacity to manage major situations requiring a unified response and a competent government. COVID is a health episode, but you have social crises that you have to respond to, criminal-justice reform. You have environmental crises that you’re going to have to respond to, climate change. And what this really points out is our inability to mount an effective defense. Why are we ineffective? First, we have to be unified to mount a defense, and we’re more divided than ever before.</p>
<p>Second, you have to have a competent government that is highly efficient and highly effective, and our government has atrophied for decades. We just haven’t used the muscle, and the muscle has atrophied. It just shows a larger problem that we have as a nation.</p>
<p>And as a world. The WHO has been, in certain ways, a disaster.</p>
<p>You’re right, the world. But just from our selfish, parochial point of view, from the nation’s point of view, the World Health Organization, they missed it. And by the way, if you look at the CDC and NIH, they have the same job description as the World Health Organization. They were supposed to be watching the global pandemic.</p>
<p>The virus was in China in December. They knew it. How they assumed that it was going to stay there, I have no idea. But it went to Europe in January, February, March. They missed it. It was coming here from Europe. They missed it. No health screening at airports; flights landing at JFK, Newark. We had tens of thousands of infections before anyone ever knew.</p>
<p>Reading your book, I was thinking of RFK’s book Thirteen Days, about the Cuban Missile Crisis. Your book could have been called Nineteen Days. You’ve been criticized in retrospect for moving too slowly, but you actually got to a shutdown pretty quickly.</p>
<p>In 19 days. And these are New Yorkers, right? We had heard about cases in China, heard about cases in California and Seattle, but New Yorkers, there is a certain parochialism for New Yorkers — it’s not real until it happens here. Right? Well, there are cases in Seattle, I know, but that’s far away.</p>
<p>March 1, we have our first case. That’s when it starts to get real. In 19 days, you have to bring the public to a point where they will accept the most dramatic government policies maybe ever enacted. You find the last time government said, “Close your business. Close your school. Stay home. Wear a mask. Don’t hug your parents.” Government has never done that. They had to accept that, and they had to believe that it was credible, because if they disregarded the policy, it would have all been over. I couldn’t enforce any of those policies. How do you enforce “Everybody must stay in their house”? You don’t have the governmental ability to do it. So all you had was the chance that you could actually convince people that it was necessary.</p>
<p>In the book, you refer to Errol Morris’s documentary about Robert McNamara, The Fog of War, and you talk about the fog of COVID. One thing it seems clear you wish you had known was that the disease was coming from Europe. What other things do you wish you had known?</p>
<p>To spread the virus, they said, you have to be symptomatic. Sneezing and coughing — that’s how it spreads. Wrong, wrong, wrong. They missed asymptomatic spread. What’s amazing about that mistake is that you had European doctors and Chinese doctors say in The New England Journal of Medicine that people were spreading it without showing symptoms.</p>
<p>But I wonder what different policy approach you would build on that knowledge. Even today, knowing that asymptomatics contribute so significantly to the spread of the disease, we’re still basically testing only symptomatic people.</p>
<p>Well, part of it is what you told people was untrue. And I believe they would have been more cautious if they knew that. If the person was asymptomatic, you were totally comfortable giving them a good-night kiss — that was a mistake. Second, we do test asymptomatics now. It totally changed our testing protocol when we heard that. Our testing protocol has nothing to do with symptoms.</p>
<p>But you’re still depending on people coming to the test site. We’re not doing surveillance-scale testing, where we’re requiring everyone to take a test to get into schools or go to the supermarket. It’s still people volunteering for a test, so it’s going to disproportionately reflect symptomatics, who may be responsible for only about half of transmission.</p>
<p>Yeah, but there’s a gray there. We’ve never gotten a court order to have somebody tested. But colleges, it’s mandatory testing. Nursing homes, it’s mandatory testing. We’ve never had a case where the college student says “I refuse,” and the college says “Well, then I’m going to expel you.” But we do blanket testing of categories now.</p>
<p>Why not include high schools and elementary schools in that?</p>
<p>I’ve recommended it to the local school districts. I’ve recommended they do as aggressive testing as they can. I don’t know that still, as a nation, we have enough tests to do … Just take New York City schoolchildren. It’s like a million, right? You could never do a million schoolchildren every day. You have 140,000 nursing-home workers. You could never do 140,000 nursing-home workers every day. But we have 20 million people in the state. So you still are nowhere near what you would like to do, right? You don’t have the physical capacity to do that volume every day. But that would be ideal. Rapid testing would be ideal.</p>
<p>Going back to the spring and what we could have done differently, I assume you wish also that we had been earlier to understand the preventative role that masks would play as well. Right?</p>
<p>The big three mistakes: You missed it when it came; you were slow in closing it down; you did no health screening at the airports. Second, you were wrong on asymptomatic spread. Third, you were wrong on masks. Fourth, you were operationally incompetent. You couldn’t mobilize the testing. You couldn’t provide the PPE. You provided no federal controls. The premise of delegating to 50 states in a national pandemic made no sense. COVID is not a New York, New Jersey, Connecticut issue. It’s a national issue.</p>
<p>Especially given the much greater capacity the federal government has to mobilize capital and resources. Sending states into a marketplace to bid against one another, instead—</p>
<p>They had the Defense Production Act to do just that. You call up a clothing manufacturer and say, “I need you to make masks. I need you to make gowns. And you must do it.” They did the exact opposite. They made every state compete to find masks and then subject yourself to all sorts of fraud and bid up the price tenfold. Reliant on the owner of the New England Patriots football team to fly a private jet to China.</p>
<p>You almost couldn’t imagine a more dramatic or explicit failure of federal leadership. Yet I look around, especially at our peer countries in Europe, and I see the U.S. has fared poorly compared with most of our peer countries but not categorically worse in deaths per million, for instance. Outside the countries of East and Southeast Asia, there are very few success stories anywhere. So how should we think about the particular responsibility of the Trump administration versus just what it means to be fighting a pandemic in a state of ignorance and on the fly?</p>
<p>I question your quantifiable assumptions of success. This country had a later wave, right? The other countries were early. But you look at what Italy and the U.K. and France and Spain lose per day now. They’re losing 50, 100 lives. We’re losing a thousand. So on the numbers, we’re in a much worse position than they are.</p>
<p>Second, they all nationalized the response. And whatever happened early on — Boris Johnson, etc. — they all got it certainly by March. And we still had this up until today, a federal disconnect, right, where the president still wouldn’t wear a mask. It became a politicized issue and divided the nation. And any of these issues, be it social crisis, post-pandemic, environmental action, you ought to be unified. These are controversial, hard policies. You have to be unified as a nation. A divided nation is never going to do this.</p>
<p>So in terms of what was within your control and your purview as governor, do you have any regrets about how you handled the spring? I know in your book you defend your response on nursing homes. What do you regret?</p>
<p>Masks. We were the first state in the nation to mandate masks, but I should have done it earlier.</p>
<p>How big a difference do you think that would have made?</p>
<p>Well, here’s what I’ll never know. It’s misleading to say you could have done anything just by establishing a government policy. Government couldn’t do any of these things on its own. They had to be socially accepted. Could I have convinced the people of this state to wear masks earlier? Could I have effectively convinced the state of the severity faster than 19 days? And here’s the flip side: If you pull the trigger and you were wrong, if you ever articulate a policy and the people don’t follow it, your credibility is gone. You only get one misfire. Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>But masks is an interesting one because, even as the public-health guidance was mixed, we did see all across Asia everybody preemptively start to wear masks, as they do not just when there’s a respiratory epidemic but even in the case of a normal flu season. And it probably did quite dramatically reduce their experience with the disease, although there are other factors there as well, of course.</p>
<p>You’ll never know, because it’s not like for 19 days I was communicating in a vacuum. The president of the United States was communicating the exact opposite. I’m saying, “We’re going to have to close down everything.” He’s saying, “This is going to be gone by Easter.” He’s saying it’s a hoax.</p>
<p>And even Fauci was advising against mask-wearing for quite a long time, just because the science was so confused on that point. That could turn out to be the most consequential misstep in the whole American response.</p>
<p>Yes. Surgeon general tweets there’s no reason to wear a mask, leave it to health-care officials. Now, in light of all of that, I’m saying “Wear a mask.” But you have the president of the United States saying it’s bullshit. You have the surgeon general saying it’s nonsense. You’re having Fauci saying it’s not worth it. So this is not in a vacuum, and I can’t announce a policy that people reject or don’t wholeheartedly accept.</p>
<p>The challenge is especially acute because you’re doing something the public would have considered completely hysterical just a few weeks before.</p>
<p>It’s just unreal and hysterical. It is so intrusive. When does government intrude on your personal life that way? “Wear a seat belt.” “You have no business telling me to wear a seat belt.” “Don’t text and drive.” “I resent you trying to control my personal behavior.” “I don’t think you should drink until you’re 21.” “That’s an intrusion.” Now we tell them, “You shouldn’t leave your house. You can’t go to school. You can’t go to work. You have to wear a mask. You can’t come within six feet of another person.” While the president is saying, “It’s all baloney.”</p>
<p>That’s why the briefings were incredible, David. How did that happen? People wanted information. They tuned in, and the communication was on a wholly different level. There was a sincerity and authenticity and a credibility that they discerned from the briefings. And they believed it. And you know they believed it because in 19 days, they did things that were unimaginable two weeks before.</p>
<p>Let me give you one other first-perspective mistake, if I could have done it over again. You now have Trump telling Woodward he knew what was happening, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which is sort of an interesting parallel because, if this is true what they’re saying today, that he had a test 72 hours ago, which is what the doctor said today, that means he knew he was positive, and he did the whole day of campaigning in New Jersey after they knew he was positive.</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s criminal, really.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, literally, people have been prosecuted for transmitting HIV knowingly.</p>
<p>That’s exactly right. And it’s a total parallel to Woodward saying Trump told him in February this was terrible, but he wasn’t going to tell the American people.</p>
<p>He didn’t want us to know.</p>
<p>It’s a parallel. In February, New York State was not authorized to do any tests. The CDC was doing all the tests. They had the testing protocol, literally the reagents, in the formula. And we were sending all our samples to them to test. And they were very slow in turning around the samples. I thought they were just slow and incompetent. Now you have to wonder: Were they slow and incompetent, or they just didn’t want us to know the virus was here? It would have been illegal for me to do the tests without sending them to the CDC in February. But in retrospect, I would have done it anyway. I would have told them to go to hell.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about schools. America is having a much harder time opening schools in the midst of a pandemic than most of the European countries. And even beyond that, in New York, the planning has seemed quite chaotic and stop and go over the past few months, especially in the city. Why?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, you’d have to ask Mayor Bill de Blasio the question.</p>
<p>What’s your critique of how he has handled it?</p>
<p>The factual analysis — not to get into editorial comment — you have 700 school districts in the state. We have left it to each individual school district to come up with a plan subject to state guidance. All 700 school districts did that, and they have a variety of plans. What happened in New York City is they put forward a plan and then failed to complete it, so they had to delay the opening. They came up with a second plan and failed to complete it and had to delay the opening. That’s where people get the impression of disorganization.</p>
<p>Could you have done anything to prevent that from happening? Could you have intervened, claiming that authority at the state level?</p>
<p>No. The state would have had to declare an emergency and take over the City Department of Education. Education is a locally run function, subject to overall state regulation by the State Department of Education, which I don’t control — I don’t even control it on the state side.</p>
<p>There’s 700 school districts in this state, and there’s politics in this state. You have very Republican districts upstate. Any one of them is capable of saying, “Oh no, no. The parents in my district want to stay open.” That happens, my credibility and my effectiveness go right down the drain. It just has to happen once.</p>
<p>But you have required employees of nursing homes to be tested. You’ve required students at state colleges to be tested. Theoretically, you could put regulations in place that would govern at least some aspects of the opening of schools, right?</p>
<p>Well, we have. We have state guidance. We say, “There has to be distancing. There has to be masks. There has to be a testing regimen.” But then the localities design the exact plan to do that with their parents and with their teachers.</p>
<p>So if you were in Bill de Blasio’s shoes, how would you have handled things differently in the city?</p>
<p>Well, I think anyone would say what’s important is public confidence, the demonstration of capacity. So come up with a plan that is accepted and you can execute. It’s never good when you come up with a plan and you say school is going to start on Monday, and everybody plans their life that way, and then you change, and then you change again. That’s been the problem in New York City.</p>
<p>And we haven’t gotten to stage two — what actually happens when you bring students back. Does the infection spread? We don’t know that yet because New York City hasn’t done any testing in the schools of the teachers and the students that they published. And that’s the real question, right? Does the virus increase? That we don’t know. That we’ll know next week and the week after.</p>
<p>Well, you said earlier that you suspect, of course, that there will be some amount of transmission. It’s just a matter of how much. Right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Let’s talk a little more, big picture, about where this leaves the state and the city in kind of a long-term way. The short-term impact has been enormous — as you mention in the book, we’ve already paid out 16 years of unemployment benefits in four months. But you’re also planning for a major budget shortfall. You put austerity measures in the budget that you approved earlier in the spring, partly as a way of dealing with that. We’ve seen in Michigan that some tax revenue has been higher than anticipated. But what do you expect for New York? What kind of a hole do you expect New York State will be in?</p>
<p>Well, we were talking about tides. New York is going to be especially susceptible to the national tide. And this is a national problem. This economic issue, like the pandemic from day one, was a national problem. And if we don’t receive federal assistance, it’s going to be a negative, at least midterm negative, for our economy. If we ever had to close this deficit on our own, it would require higher taxes, cutting of expenses, and borrowing.</p>
<p>It’s a $50 billion deficit. It’s the highest in the history of the state. The question is normally: Do you raise taxes, or cut expenses, or do you borrow? Here there is no “or”; it would be “and.” You’d have to cut expenses and tax and borrow. And you would hurt the economy. And you would hurt the city, more so.</p>
<p>New York City, you have an additional challenge, which is similar but much worse than the challenge after 9/11. After 9/11, there was a period where people were questioning New York City in general and the safety of the city. Nobody wanted to go downtown. People were afraid to come back into the city. We have that, plus, right? There’s a sense that New York City and the density and the crowding is a problem for COVID. That’s compounded by a sense of rising crime, rising homelessness, lack of capacity. So those issues are all interrelated. There’s no doubt that it’s going to take significant, united, aggressive action to get New York City back to where it needs to be.</p>
<p>How much federal support do you think will be necessary?</p>
<p>Well, the hole is $50 billion. Anything short of that is going to require us to make it up on our own. The biggest deficit the state has ever solved on its own has been about $10 billion, and that required real hardship. I’m asking [the federal government] for the 50 because my point is it’s their liability. They caused it. They missed the virus coming from Europe, not New Yorkers. It was their negligence that caused this. Why would we be liable?</p>
<p>But I have handled a lot of disasters and emergencies and reconstruction. When I was at HUD, I worked on dozens of hurricanes, floods, etc. We had Superstorm Sandy here, even our 9/11 experience in New York. There’s an opportunity in this. When you rebuild, you don’t build back what was there before. You build it back better. You sustain damage on your home; all right, you put in an insurance claim, and a tree fell and hit the roof and you have to fix it. But by the way, in the meantime, you have a new roof. And they have to redo the windows, and you have better windows that provide better energy efficiency, and the house is better for it. I believe that’s true for the City of New York. We have a lot of these issues that had to be dealt with anyway.</p>
<p>Look at the subways. If I said to you, “We’re going to disinfect every subway car. And we’re going to get the homeless out of the entire system — every car, every station,” you would say “Impossible.” By the way, I would have said “Impossible.” But we did that.</p>
<p>To stay on the MTA for a second, as a case study going forward, what do we need to do to solve that problem to make it a public service that endures, providing the kind of service New Yorkers have come to expect?</p>
<p>Well, they are now getting the best service they ever had. Cleaner trains, more planned service, more capital repairs—</p>
<p>But, I mean, their budget is in terrible shape, right?</p>
<p>Well, that’s just money. But all this is just money. The MTA needs money; the state needs money. There’s nothing that we don’t know how to do. It’s a question of funding.</p>
<p>Do you worry about what will happen if the state doesn’t get it? You mentioned a few minutes ago that fear about life in the city in general being unsafe. Do you worry about the long-term hole that people leaving New York could make in our social fabric here?</p>
<p>Yes. But on my list of worries, I worry about COVID, too. I worry about the next virus. I worry about climate change. I worry about the next storm and the next flood. I worry about social unrest. And then I worry that there may be total insanity in Washington and we don’t receive federal aid. But it would have to be total insanity.</p>
<p>It would mean if they don’t come to an agreement now — I spoke to Speaker Pelosi yesterday, Secretary Mnuchin. It means that deal never comes together. It means Joe Biden doesn’t win. Because if Joe Biden wins, he’ll provide aid. It means the Senate doesn’t go Democratic. Because if it goes Democratic, Senator Schumer will certainly provide the aid. The only way that happens is all of the above would have to collapse. President Trump wins reelection, and the Republican Senate wins reelection. If that happens, I’m sure they would maintain this position of “We’re not going to help Democratic states,” which is all that they’re saying. It’s just political. But I don’t believe that is a realistic probability.</p>
<p>Every day, I hear New Yorkers talking about the city going back to the ’70s. Where do you think we’re heading?</p>
<p>I think we’re going to be better for it. We’ll mourn the loss and grieve those lost, like we do 9/11. But we’ll be stronger and better for it.</p>
<p>I do believe this has been the most challenging time for government, because government was more relevant. The consequences were higher, and government had a greater responsibility — not just to communicate and connect with people, and not just to develop trust, which was so necessary, but it then had to perform. It had to do the tests. It had to do the PPE. It had to find hospital capacity. And it did. In every projection, including the IHME model, which is what the White House used, 110 to 140,000 New Yorkers would need hospital beds. And we flattened that curve. That is inarguable, and that is a remarkable achievement that saved lives. And I have been in government for a long time. There’s very few circumstances where government action will either save lives or cost lives and the connection will be demonstrable. That was the situation here. And it still is.</p>
<p>It’s also kind of amazing to think how sort of personal that experience was for you. I mean, obviously, you have a team; you have a huge number of people working with you. But to a certain extent, also because of the conditions of the pandemic, you were relatively isolated during this time. And during that time, you became one of the most trusted figures in American politics as the whole country faced down this nightmare, but you were also dealing with and presiding over this incredibly grim crisis on the ground. You had it on all sides.</p>
<p>It was incredible. But I’ll tell you what was most incredible in retrospect. I don’t even have the words for it. There weren’t two sides. It was one side. Every conversation was the same. People saying there’s no way government can put the policies in place enough that we flatten the curve. And there’s no way that people would follow them, even if you put them in place. It’s just too dramatic, especially in New York, where people are very strong-willed and we’re very diverse. Plus, nobody trusts government anymore. And I was a popular governor, but you’re going to a level of connectivity and trust that people just don’t have with government anymore. I mean, you have to go back to — when was government that intense, World War II?</p>
<p>Well, definitely before Reagan.</p>
<p>To establish the connection that was necessary, I didn’t communicate as an elected official. I didn’t separate the conversations I was having with my family and the conversations I was having at the briefings. They were the same conversation. I was doing the briefings every morning for two hours. I wasn’t sleeping. There was no official hat and unofficial hat. I did not speak as a politician, as a governor. I didn’t even have any of those filters. When I didn’t know the facts, I told you that. When I was worried, I told you that. When I saw a glimmer of light, I told you that. When I was sick to my stomach worried about my brother, I told you that. When I was frightened for my mother, I told you that. When I had to quarantine my daughter, I told you that.</p>
<p>The boyfriend.</p>
<p>Now, in normal politics they would say, “Oh, you can’t talk. You can’t show fear. They’ll use that against you. The press will mock you. You can’t tell those jokes. They’re not funny. The press will mock you.” But for me, it was all or nothing anyway. They had to believe me. They had to trust me. They had to trust the information, and I had a very short period of time to do it. The briefings, all I had were the numbers. There were no remarks prepared. There was no discussion beforehand. It was all just genuine daily conversation. And if they were going to mock my sense of humor or mock me for being weak because I expressed fear, so be it. But if I didn’t connect, then people wouldn’t follow the policies and then the curve wouldn’t be flattened and then we’d have tens of thousands more people dead. So that’s what I did.</p>

<h3 id="comedians-skit-about-governor-cuomo-and-his-daughter-nets-praise-from-colbert-alec-baldwin">&ldquo;Comedian’s Skit About Governor Cuomo and His Daughter Nets Praise From Colbert, Alec Baldwin&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Cuomoskit.jpg" alt="img">
While late-night comedians may be chafing under the constrictions of the coronavirus pandemic — having no live audience is a challenge — many comedians who use social media as their primary medium are thriving.</p>
<p>Take actor-comedian Maria DeCotis, who recently posted a brief skit to Twitter in which she plays New York Governor Andrew Cuomo talking about his daughter Mariah’s boyfriend. DeCotis plays all three characters, lip-syncing to Cuomo’s bumbling speech about how fathers have to pretend to like their daughters’ boyfriends.</p>
<p>Since DeCotis posted the clip on May 1st, it’s been viewed more than 1 million times, with praise and retweets from the likes of Padma Lakshmi, Mike Birbiglia, Alec Baldwin and Stephen Colbert.</p>
<p>“I was so surprised by how much attention it got,” DeCotis tells Rolling Stone. “I think the most flattering was being retweeted by Stephen Colbert and other comedians and actors and journalists that I admire. Lisa Ann Walter, from The Parent Trap, shared and commented on my video and I was in shock. I rented The Parent Trap from Blockbuster literally every single time my mom took me. I rented the same movie over and over again. I thought, ‘Do I want to see something new? Or just watch the best movie of all time again?'”</p>
<p>DeCotis says she was inspired to make the video after watching Cuomo good-naturedly bumble through an April 19th news briefing. “He started to go on this tangent about his daughter’s boyfriend. I thought it was riveting. I couldn’t take my eyes off him,” she says. “He just kept digging himself deeper and deeper into this hole. It was hilarious! I have a sort of affinity for him because I come from an Italian family and his mannerisms and demeanor remind me a lot of my own father.”</p>
<p>There’s been a recent uptick in TikToks and Twitter videos in which comedians lip-sync to politicians — especially Trump — and DeCotis decided to try that method out for herself. She has since followed up the first video with another clip of Cuomo talking about his daughter and another in which the governor’s fictional girlfriend has him rate his performance (that one takes more liberties with context).</p>
<p>A New Yorker, DeCotis is currently self-isolating, and she says making these videos provides her with a way to make it through the daily drag. “It has been difficult, but I remind myself of the frontline workers who risk their lives every day,” she says. “I feel very fortunate to have a roof over my head, I received my stimulus check, still waiting on unemployment, but I have my physical health and that’s all I can ask for right now.</p>
<p>“I just ordered some rollerskates so I’m super excited about that! I’m trying to take my mind off this crisis by focusing on creating and taking breaks out in the sun — when there is some,” she adds.</p>
<p>As for whether or not the Cuomo family is aware of her videos, DeCotis hasn’t heard anything to suggest as much. “I was hoping Governor Cuomo would see it and it would give him a good laugh, but I don’t want anything else from him — except maybe my unemployment money,” she quips.</p>
<p>Governor Cuomo appeared on the April issue of Rolling Stone. In the cover story interview, Cuomo explained how he differs from his father, former Governor Mario Cuomo: “My father communicated aspiration, but he did it in a formal sense. He did not speak personally, in terms of himself or his family or his life or his experiences. He was a formal speaker. The expression I used to use was: He’s a big-room speaker. He’s a podium speaker. He spoke to large audiences, right? That was his art form. He would not talk about family experiences the way I’ve spoken about them here.”

<h3 id="cuomos-advice-to-fathers-the-answer-has-to-be-i-like-the-boyfriend">&ldquo;Cuomo’s advice to fathers: The answer has to be ‘I like the boyfriend’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6W7ITRUCMQI6VANDS2IMTCARCE.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
It was Sunday, Cuomo said, which meant a spaghetti-and-meatballs feast for his Italian American family. His daughter, 25-year-old Mariah Kennedy Cuomo, had joined him to share updated numbers of cases and covid-19-linked deaths, and had decided to bring her boyfriend to the family meal afterward.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“Advice to fathers: The answer on what you think of the boyfriend is always, ‘I like the boyfriend,’ ” Cuomo said. “Otherwise it triggers ‘NDS.’ NDS is ‘natural defiance syndrome.’ It’s not documented, but it is a psychological condition where if you say as a father ‘I don’t like him,’ natural defiance syndrome kicks in and then they like the boyfriend more because he is opposed by the father. So the answer has to be ‘I like the boyfriend.’ ”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The dad joke went on for more than a minute, as Cuomo reiterated the dangers of showing disapproval for a daughter’s suitor. Better to feign acceptance and eat pasta in peace.</p>
<p>But Cuomo reassured everyone watching at home, and his daughter sitting a few feet away, that he really does appreciate Mariah’s boyfriend. Over the weekend, the three took a walk with Cuomo’s puppy, a shepherd-Siberian-malamute mix named Captain, according to a photo posted to her Instagram.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“The boyfriend is very nice,” he said during the news conference, “and we like the boyfriend.”</p>
<p>Indeed, what’s not to like? A former college football player at Brown University, 29-year-old Tellef Lundevall had a brief professional basketball career in Norway and now runs his own digital media consultancy in Chicago. He’s tall — 6-foot-4, to be exact — and he sails, and did we mention the Norwegian part? (The Post’s attempts to reach Lundevall on Sunday evening were unsuccessful.)</p>
<p>Cuomo, however, was less positive about his cooking skills. Although he had left tomato sauce bubbling on the stove during the update, he didn’t expect his hard work in the kitchen to win him much favor with his daughters.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“They won’t eat the spaghetti and the meatballs,” he said, “because when I cook it they just won’t eat it. But they move it around the dish and that’s all I can ask.”</p>
<p>The lighter moment came in the middle of yet another sobering breakdown of the novel coronavirus’s impact in the state. More than 18,000 people have died in New York and 248,417 cases have been reported in the state as of Monday morning. But the outbreak appears to be improving. Cuomo announced a new low in the number of coronavirus-related deaths and hospitalizations, after days of leveling off at the state’s peak numbers.</p>
<p>“If the data holds, and if this trend holds, we are past the high point,” he said, “and all indications at this point are that we are on the descent.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Many people were more interested in Cuomo’s dinner plans than the latest coronavirus numbers. Later in the evening, the governor shared a photo of his family sitting around a table for spaghetti and meatballs. (Contrary to his earlier statements, most of the plates were, in fact, clean, with little tomato sauce left over.)</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>It was, tweeted a physician, “the most normal thing I’ve seen on TV in weeks.”</p>
<p>Although the concept of “reactance” — wanting something that has been forbidden — is real, a psychologist told The Post that parental disapproval is unlikely to drive two lovers closer together for long. And the real influence may not be defiance, but a preference for the approval of friends.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“It might seem like your children are deliberately defying your wishes, but it’s more likely that they are irritated by your disapproval and care more about what their friends think than what you think,” Gwendolyn Seidman, associate professor of psychology and chair of Albright College’s psychology department, told The Post. “But if parents are less influential than peers, expressing disapproval of your child’s relationships may be more likely to harm your relationship with your child than to actually get your child to break off the romance.”

<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/24/13/27599706-0-image-a-6_1587730896456.jpg" alt="img">
Goofing around with the Kennedys, hunting and scoring the winning touchdown for his Ivy League college football team, this is the mystery boyfriend thrust into the spotlight by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo&rsquo;s toe-curling dad jokes.</p>
<p>Cuomo&rsquo;s coronavirus press conference took a curious detour on Sunday when he offered unsolicited advice on what to do when your daughter brings her suitor over for Sunday dinner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The answer of what you think of the boyfriend is always, &lsquo;&lsquo;I like the boyfriend.&rsquo;&rsquo; Always,&rsquo; he joked, with the daughter in question, Mariah Kennedy Cuomo, sitting a few feet away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In this case, I actually like the boyfriend,&rsquo; he assured her, giving a belated seal of approval to her 6ft 4in Norwegian beau, Tellef Lundevall, 29.</p>
<p>On Monday he reiterated he likes &lsquo;the boyfriend,&rsquo; but added his dog, Scout, &lsquo;does not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>DailyMail.com can reveal the pair met at storied Brown University, where 25-year-old Mariah - one of three daughters Cuomo shares with his ex-wife, Kerry Kennedy - majored in history and graduated with honors.</p>
<p>New York Governor Andrew Cuomo&rsquo;s daughter Mariah Kennedy Cuomo, 25, is dating Tellef Lundevall, 29. DailyMail.com can reveal the pair met at storied Brown University, where 25-year-old Mariah - one of three daughters Cuomo shares with his ex-wife, Kerry Kennedy - majored in history and graduated with honors</p>
<p>Cuomo offered unsolicited advice on what to do when your daughter brings her suitor over for Sunday dinner. &lsquo;The answer of what you think of the boyfriend is always, &lsquo;&lsquo;I like the boyfriend.&rsquo;&rsquo; Always,&rsquo; he joked, with Mariah sitting a few feet away</p>
<p>Popular, academically gifted and the scion of two famed political families, Mariah was in her freshman year when she caught the eye of Lundevall, a senior and strapping football standout</p>
<p>Lundevall got the nod of approval from the Kennedy side of the family, joining the famous brood for sailing trip off the coast of Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, making a funny face and leaping off the side of the boat for a July 2018 photograph (pictured)</p>

<p>Lundevall&rsquo;s 216 career receptions are seventh in the Ivy record book, earning the wide receiver a tryout with the Tennessee Titans in 2014.</p>
<p>Governor Cuomo has addressed his daughter&rsquo;s love life at a coronavirus press conference several times, saying &lsquo;I like the boyfriend.&rsquo; But, he added, Captain, his dog, does not</p>
<p>The economics and geology major was also good enough at basketball to play professionally for a club in his native Norway before returning to the US to run his own digital media consultancy firm.</p>
<p>A keen huntsman and sailor, he grew up in Highland Park, a wealthy city on the northern fringe of Chicago, with parents Jessica and Torjus, who run a pet toy business and three siblings, Kaja, Iselin and Hallvard.</p>
<p>Lundevall got the nod of approval from the Kennedy side of the family, vacationing with them at a swank Swiss ski resort and joining the famous brood for sailing trip off the coast of Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>He is seen making a funny face and leaping off the side of the boat for a July 2018 photograph.</p>
<p>He and Mariah set social media alight when they cozied up for their first &lsquo;couples&rsquo; snap in December that same year against a snow-covered backdrop.</p>

<p>The man being touted as his future son-in-law was CEO of his own company at 25, chairs an environment committee for a social justice foundation set up by his mom&rsquo;s side of the family and has held down a string of executive jobs in both the US, for Google, and in Norway</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that Oslo in the background?&rsquo; asked Mariah&rsquo;s excited mom Kerry, a human rights activist and third daughter of Robert F. Kennedy. In fact, the picture was taken in Aspen, Colorado.</p>
<p>Lundevall is in illustrious company: Mariah&rsquo;s Instagram page is a revolving door of photos with celebrities and leading political figures, including Barack Obama, Coldplay singer Chris Martin and of course her father, who has clashed routinely with President Donald Trump over his management of the Covid-19 crisis.</p>
<p>Cuomo should be impressed by Lundevall&rsquo;s resume.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Tellef is a hard worker, talented and he always reaches for perfection,&rsquo; a former boss gushed on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If he returns to Norway, we want him to work for us. We wish him all the best in his career.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The blond-haired, blue eyed hunk has even volunteered at a tiger and lion sanctuary and for a charity that distributes food door-to-door to the poor</p>

<p>Little wonder then, he&rsquo;s earned a place at Gov. Cuomo&rsquo;s dinner table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I started my tomato sauce before I left,&rsquo; Cuomo volunteered on Sunday during his press briefing in Manhasset, Long Island.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;re going to go back, we&rsquo;re going to sit at the table, and have spaghetti and meatballs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said Mariah, now an associate at a global consulting firm Teneo, would be joining him for the traditional Italian feast along with her boyfriend, whom Cuomo didn&rsquo;t directly name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s only two options,&rsquo; he went on, offering a piece of advice to his fellow fathers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Either you like the boyfriend, in which case you say, &lsquo;I like the boyfriend,&rsquo; or you don&rsquo;t like the boyfriend. But you can never say you don&rsquo;t like the boyfriend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Otherwise, it triggers NDS. NDS is Natural Defiance Syndrome. It&rsquo;s not documented, but it is a psychological condition.</p>

<p>There was a serious point to Cuomo&rsquo;s parental advice, he explained, stressing the importance of family time, a privilege he suggested frontline healthcare workers were having to forgo in the battle with Coronavirus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Think of all the people, all the essential workers who had to go out there every day and work in the middle of this, who frankly would have much rather stayed home,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They didn&rsquo;t get to stay home, and they got sicker and they died, more than anyone else, because they were there honoring their responsibility to their job and to public service.&rsquo;
