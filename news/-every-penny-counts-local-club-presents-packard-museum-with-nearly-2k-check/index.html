<p>The money came from a caravan fundraiser two weeks ago</p>
<p>(WKBN) – A local club handed a big check to a museum many in the Valley enjoy going to.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Mahoning Valley Corvette Club presented a check worth $1,654 to the Packard Museum.</p>
<p>The money came from a caravan fundraiser two weeks ago.</p>
<p>“We cannot thank them enough. We need this kind of support in the community. This museum is no small task in running and during this covid emergency every penny counts for us,” said Mary Ann Porinchak, the museum’s executive director.</p>
<p>Between 80 and 90 cars made the fundraiser possible, which was a collective event that included the City of Warren, health department and police department.

Posted Tuesday, August 11, 2020 12:16 pm</p>
<p>This is a vital program the likes of which have not been seen before, where all the support is in one location; therefore, teen women only need Teen Strong to get the direction and answers to many of their needs. Vital to Arizona, it can clearly become a nationwide, state-by-state effort utilizing the Arizona template that I wholeheartedly endorse” Superstition Mountain Rotary Club President Harvey Clark</p>
<p>Superstition Mountain Rotary Club &ndash; in cooperation with the Arizona Rotary District 5495 grants program &ndash; awarded a $5,000 grant to Teen Strong of Mesa.</p>
<p>It is a combined effort of $2,500 from the club and a matching $2,500 from the district, according to a release.</p>
<p>The funds will be used in the community and throughout the state as a stimulus to help teen girls in need.</p>
<p>Superstition Mountain Rotary Club President Harvey Clark presented the check to Teen Strong founder Sherry Eklund at a recent meeting.</p>
<p>“This is a vital program the likes of which have not been seen before, where all the support is in one location; therefore, teen women only need Teen Strong to get the direction and answers to many of their needs. Vital to Arizona, it can clearly become a nationwide, state-by-state effort utilizing the Arizona template that I wholeheartedly endorse,” President Clark said in the release.</p>
<p>Teen Strong is designed to help girls find inspiration and information to help move them through the challenging teen years. Teen Strong is devoted to providing quality articles that support the issues important to the girls (ages 13 to 20) throughout the state of Arizona, the release states.</p>
<p>“Throughout our lives, we all have questions, need help and guidance about important and sometimes life changing issues. Young women, especially teens, don’t always know what resources are available, or how to access them,” the release states.</p>
<p>The website Iamteenstrong.com was created for that purpose. Teen Strong is a boutique website dedicated to making a difference in the lives of teen girls in the state.</p>
<p>Additionally, Sherry Eklund announced TEENSTRONGAZ.com is now IamTEENSTRONG.com. The name change will allow the program to reach other states using the Arizona platform, the release states.</p>

<h3 id="jase-happy-to-take-a-back-seat">&ldquo;Jase happy to take a back seat&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.krockfootball.com.au/wp-content/uploads/North-Shore-Jason-Davenport-2.jpg" alt="img">
JASON Davenport has ruled out taking on an official coaching role with North Shore ahead of his welcome return to the GFL club.</p>
<p>The former Port Adelaide and Geelong VFL forward, who coached the Seagulls from 2015-17 before taking on a development coaching role with AFL club Carlton, revealed last week he would be returning to Windsor Park.</p>
<p>However, he’s happy to sit back and just run out at 2pm every Saturday without the added pressure.</p>
<p>“The initial conversations have been around just being a player; it’s something I haven’t had the opportunity to do at the footy club,” Davenport said.</p>
<p>“I’m sure once the competition starts, I won’t be able to help myself, in regards to supporting the coaching staff.</p>
<p>“But the lifestyle that our family want, and the commitment that GFL footy has, especially from a coaching perspective, we just wanted to make sure there was still some flexibility there in and around resting every now and then and getting out of town.</p>
<p>“And also ticking the games over in supporting the playing group improving and getting back to where North Shore should be.”</p>
<p>GFL: JOEYS UPGRADE FAST-TRACKED</p>
<p>Davenport, who turns 35 early next month, hopes to play for at least two more seasons to play the 25 matches needed to reach 100 at North Shore.</p>
<p>“Physically, the challenge is to maintain a certain standard which the GFL requires,” he said.</p>
<p>“Mentally, having this year off will really help. I’m already looking forward to the challenge of playing at GFL level against these young up-and-coming players that are in the pursuit of what I once was.</p>
<p>“But also putting my mind to the task and utilising my knowledge of the game as much as my physical attributes because I might need it against some really quality opposition.”</p>
<p>While Davenport, who has two children aged under five, has shelved any coaching plans for the moment, he hasn’t completely ruled it out once his playing days are done.</p>
<p>“But, I’m also not in a mindset or a situation where we’re willing as a family to commit back doing that,” he said.</p>
<p>“It is a big commitment, and the club were unbelievably supportive of myself in my pursuit of cracking into the AFL and VFL system as a coach. I’m really grateful for that.</p>
<p>“But, for now, mentally, in particular, to step away from that direct coaching role, while staying stimulated through other areas of footy, and staying connected to the game, initially, my thought process would be just to play.</p>
<p>“Then we’ll see how things trend from there.”</p>
<p>The impacts of COVID-19 brought an end to his Davenport’s stint at Carlton after 2 1/2 years at Princes Park, and he concedes he’s not rushing to get back into the AFL system.</p>
<p>“I’ve got kids now and a lot our family lives overseas, and the flexibility of not being in the AFL system allows us some opportunities,” he said.</p>
<p>“Obviously amid the pandemic we can’t travel right now, but the thought of having some flexibility and freedom through the winter months in Victoria to get away, that excites us as a family because we haven’t experienced that for a long time.</p>
<p>“But, in saying that, I’m really passionate about coaching and really passionate about helping and supporting players becoming the best they can, and the avenues in which I do that are quite broad.</p>
<p>“I have a philosophy in place that I drive, and I stand for, so I’m definitely eager to assess options as time goes on.</p>
<p>“But the pursuit might be a little more different than it was 3-4 years ago.”</p>

<p><img src="https://images.s.perthnow.com.au/publication/63E90B68250792D80404EE28CECCF25F/1597210463760_e585bdde0d1456c57732a012d960d5b4.jpeg?imwidth=1024" alt="img">
Wests Tigers are willing to pay half of Moses Mbye’s hefty contract for him to play for a rival. NRL Transfer whispers.</p>
<p>Read on for all the latest NRL Transfer whispers.</p>
<p>TIGERS SET TO OFFLOAD SKIPPER TO TITANS</p>
<p>The Tigers are trying to shift captain Moses Mbye to a rival club and are willing to pay half of his $800,000 salary to do it.</p>
<p>The Sydney Morning Herald reported the Queensland Origin star has spiked interest from the Gold Coast Titans about a possible move for next season.</p>
<p>Under the proposed deal the Tigers would be willing to pay up to half of the 26-year-old’s contract to offload him to the Titans on a two-year-deal.</p>

<p>The money saved from moving Mbye on would then be used to try and entice star hooker Harry Grant to remain at the club should Cameron Smith play on at the Storm, which would trigger a clause in the Tigers rake’s contract.</p>
<p>However should Grant return to the Storm, the Tigers would then pursue Melbourne’s New Zealand No.9 Brandon Smith, who is unlikely to stay at the club as he chases a starting hooker role.</p>
<p>It is believed the Titans, who have signed Broncos back-rower David Fifita, Storm forward Tino Fa’asuamaleaui and Knights star Herman Ese’ese are looking at Mbye as a potential five-eighth or hooker.</p>
<p>WARRIORS SIGN DRAGONS, EELS STARS AND IT IS JUST THE START</p>
<p>Camera Icon Dragon&rsquo;s Euan Aitken scores against the Rabbitohs. Credit: News Corp Australia</p>
<p>Incoming Warriors coach Nathan Brown has already made a splash at the club by signing in-form centre Euan Aitken form the Dragons and Kane Evans from the Eels.</p>
<p>The Daily Telegraph reported that next on his hit list are Broncos big man Matt Lodge and Aitken’s stood down Dragons teammate Jack de Belin.</p>
<p>Aitken will link with the Warriors on a three-year-deal and Brown will then turn his attention to improving his forward stocks.</p>
<p>Lodge is contracted to the Broncos for next season, so he would need to negotiate a release to move across the Tasman.</p>
<p>Camera Icon Matt Lodge Pic Annette Dew Credit: News Corp Australia</p>
<p>The Warriors have room to move in their salary cap after the departure of five-eighth Blake Green to the Knights and Adam Blair yet to take up his one-year option after falling out of favour at the club.</p>
<p>The Dragons are set to put their faith in Zac Lomax and Brayden Wiliame and will not enter the market for a replacement for Aitken.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old Aitken has scored 38 tries in 115 NRL games, has three Tests for Scotland and was mentioned as a NSW Blues selection chance in 2018.

<p>Opening Lead: Spade queen</p>
<p>Only good girls keep diaries. Bad girls don&rsquo;t have time.</p>
<p>&ndash; Tallulah Bankhead</p>
<p>As a student, if your teacher warns you, &ldquo;Be careful how you handle the heart suit,&rdquo; take a moment to look before you leap!</p>
<p>South had a hand worth at least one try for slam, but the first thing to do was locate a trump fit. Once North produced a simple raise of spades, South drove to slam via Roman Key-card Blackwood.</p>
<p>Declarer won the top trump lead and cashed his second top spade, establishing that he had a trump loser. Then he cashed his top hearts, following what seemed like the natural sequence of the king, ace, queen. West ruffed the third round and got off lead with a club, and in the fullness of time, declarer ended up with losers in diamonds and the trump suit.</p>
<p>Once South knew that West had a trump winner, he needed to be cautious about how he handled hearts. Cashing the king was fine; so was playing toward the ace in dummy. If West held a singleton heart and chose to ruff, he would only be ruffing a loser, and there would be a home for the diamond loser. But now declarer should have returned to hand via a club in order to lead another heart. It does not help West&rsquo;s cause to ruff the club, as he will immediately be forced to lead diamonds, and declarer&rsquo;s loser will go away.</p>
<p>After scoring the heart queen, declarer cashes his remaining clubs and ruffs dummy&rsquo;s fourth heart. Again, it does not help West&rsquo;s cause to ruff the third heart, as declarer will eventually discard his diamond on dummy&rsquo;s heart winner.</p>
<p>BID WITH THE ACES</p>
<p>South holds:</p>
<p>; A K 9 6 2</p>
<p>k K 8 3</p>
<p>l Q 5</p>
<p>' A K 5</p>
<p>South West North East</p>
<p>3 k</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Three no-trump is surely the most practical call. Three spades is not nearly enough, and double risks partner&rsquo;s bidding four of a minor. You need not fear East&rsquo;s long hearts, since you expect you can hold up your king to break the defensive communications.</p>

<p>Pangai Jr attended the event despite players being told they were effectively in quarantine under the NRL&rsquo;s biosecurity protocols after Friday&rsquo;s loss to South Sydney at ANZ Stadium.</p>
<p>The Broncos were understood to be filty with their star, who was also reportedly trying to engineer an exit from the club after contacting the Roosters last week.</p>
<p>Following an investigation by the club and extensive conversations, multiple outlets were reporting on Tuesday that the Broncos have decided to tear up the remainder of his contract.</p>
<p>#BREAKING: Nine&rsquo;s @MyMateDobbo has revealed the @brisbanebroncos have run out of patience with Tevita Pangai Junior.</p>

<p>The Broncos are yet to confirm news of Pangai Jr&rsquo;s sacking after releasing a statement in the wake of the reports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The club is still finalising its investigation into Tevita Pangai Junior’s breach of Project Apollo protocols,&rdquo; the statement read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The final determination of any sanction has not been made at this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While other Brisbane staff members - including assistant coach Allan Langer - also breached the NRL&rsquo;s biosecurity protocols, Pangai Jr&rsquo;s was deemed the most serious because of his association with the bikie gang.</p>
<p>As well as the virus breach, the powerhouse forward was also deemed to have brought the club and game into disrepute.</p>
<p>The Courier Mail reports that the Broncos player will be given five days to appeal the club&rsquo;s decision and show cause why his contract - which runs until the end of the 2022 season - should not be torn up.</p>
<p>Pangai Jr is also facing a hefty fine from the NRL for his breach of the biosecurity protocols, with reports it could be as large as $40,000.</p>

<p>With the August 2 deadline passing for signing players, it means Pangai Jr would not be able to play again this season in the NRL, if he is shown the door at Brisbane.</p>
<p>He is also unlikely to be given a payout from the club, due to the nature of his breach.</p>
<p>Pangai Jr slammed for virus breach</p>
<p>The 24-year-old was roundly criticised for his latest indiscretion in rugby league circles, with Broncos legend Kevin Walters labelling his actions &ldquo;very disappointing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tevita Pangai has taken it upon himself to not listen to those rules and put himself above the rules and above the team and above the club, which is extremely disappointing from my perspective and the game&rsquo;s perspective as well,&rdquo; Walters told the Big Sports Breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all relying on these players to do the right thing &hellip; when rugby league players and sports people, in particular, don&rsquo;t do the right thing it&rsquo;s just really upsetting and disappointing in every respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Tevita is waking up today in isolation and wondering how he ever came to that decision to go to the barber shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last week Pangai Jr had to dismiss reports he was shopping himself around to rival clubs after speaking to Sydney Roosters chairman Nick Politis.</p>
<p>Walters said it was merely another sad subplot to what has been a season to forget for his former club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly it&rsquo;s been a horrendous year for the Broncos and this is another part of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His actions indicate that he probably doesn&rsquo;t want to be in the system anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="sage-ymca-piranhas-accuse-local-y-of-trying-to-eliminate-the-club">&ldquo;Sage YMCA Piranhas Accuse Local Y of Trying To “Eliminate” The Club&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.swimswam.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_20200811_123236_010.jpg?1597232217" alt="img">
The Sage YMCA Piranhas, a club team based out of Crystal Lake, Illinois, has accused its host YMCA of trying to “eliminate” the club over several years.</p>
<p>The YMCA accused of trying to push out the club is the Sage YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago.</p>
<p>The club sent out an open letter addressed to the “Crystal Lake Community and YMCA members” that lays out how the YMCA has impeded the club in various ways, ultimately leading to coach Ed Richardson‘s resignation on August 2.</p>
<p>What brought things to a head was the Sage YMCA developing a return to swim plan for the club amid the COVID-19 pandemic without consulting the coaches and ignoring emails from parents.</p>
<p>“These arrangements were developed without any input from the parent advisory council or coaching staff and the reaction from the members was bitter disappointment,” the open letter reads. “This state championship and nationally ranked team knew the reality that returning to practice would not be the same as it was pre-pandemic, but they did not expect a plan as the one presented.”</p>
<p>The plan, per a source, was to have the team reduced in size by 100 (from 220 to 120) and have two 30-person training groups offered practices twice a week for an hour each day beginning August 25. There was reportedly no word on why the team couldn’t be offered more training time or who the new coach was.</p>
<p>“The leadership at the Sage YMCA of Metro Chicago attributes the outcry from its swim community as overzealous and unsafe. But the real story pre-dates the global pandemic that the YMCA is using as a smokescreen.</p>
<p>“The truth is the decisions and actions of the YMCA of Metro Chicago have been nothing short of their quest to eliminate a ‘swim team that has been a problem for years’ according to one local director at the facility,” the letter says. “Let us reiterate that last fact. The actions taken by the leadership at the Sage YMCA to malign an important program in the lives of many young members began long before COVID-19 came to light. This program, built by generous community donors, talented coaching staff, dedicated volunteers and most importantly the children who benefitted from it, have been targeted by YMCA leadership.”</p>
<p>The letter then dives into how YMCA leadership has hindered its ability to host meets, has raised fees, and claimed the club is too much of a strain on its operating budget despite it being ‘self-sustaining and profitable’.</p>
<p>“They refuse to let the team take their turn at hosting the Northwest District Championship meet under the guise that it’s too disruptive to members when, in fact, the true reason is that they wished for a fee higher than is customarily paid to the host facility. The Northwest District meet is rotated through several area YMCAs and is a huge fundraising arm for swim teams. To deny this team the ability to receive funds over the reported ‘disruption to the other members’ while stating the team does not bring in enough revenue is contradictory. The team is asked to host this district-wide meet one weekend every three years in a rotation with other Illinois YMCAs for which not only the team, but the Sage YMCA facility is financially compensated.”</p>
<p>The club has more than doubled in size since 2013, up from 100 to 220, and there’s been a waiting list to get on the team since 2016, meaning they’d likely be approaching 300 swimmers if there was more pool time.</p>
<p>The team has also reportedly operated with a surplus of revenue every year, with last season around $8K.</p>
<p>When hosting the 2018 YMCA Northwest District Swimming Championships, it grossed $9.1K, with $3K going to the Sage YMCA. The approximate revenue stream the club has provided the YMCA as of 2020 is around $32K. After being asked to host the 2021 edition of the meet, the Sage Y management reportedly denied the opportunity.</p>
<p>“What has happened to this team over these past years has been nothing short of a travesty. Instead of using this program as a shining example for other area Metro Chicago centers it has been systematically silenced and extinguished.</p>
<p>“The spirit of this swim community has been crushed. It was never about swimmers needing more time in the pool or the restrictions to minimize the inconvenience to the other members. It is about the total disregard for what these members have contributed to the YMCA mission and the absolute unprofessional and unacceptable way the Sage YMCA leadership have maligned the mission of this team.”</p>
<p>In addition to the resignation of coach Richardson, several members have also left the club and are looking to train elsewhere, the letter says.</p>
<p>“While the Sage YMCA will continue with its Piranhas swim team program many of us have chosen to resign our membership. While we pick up the pieces and go our separate ways the sorrow is deep and the loss palpable. With the lack of area pools there is no place for us to go together as a team and even individually we will struggle to find places due to the capacity limits COVID-19 brings. The monopoly the Sage YMCA holds over the local community and the lack of a public aquatics facility is the sad reality.</p>
<p>“To belong to a non-profit entity that claims its ‘mission is to build strong kids, strong families and strong communities by enriching the lives of all people in spirit, mind and body” but sees its “swim team as a huge problem” is intolerable. But in the end, perhaps the YMCA achieved its stated mission–we ARE a team of strong kids, strong families and a strong swimming community, and we will go where we can live that mission fully.”</p>
<p>You can read the full open letter below:</p>
<p>An open letter to the Sage YMCA of Metro Chicago and the Community:</p>
<p>Dear Crystal Lake community and YMCA members,</p>
<p>The current global pandemic has affected our communities in ways that we are only beginning to understand. The disruption to education, activities, family life and our ability to come together as a community is something we have all been challenged with in one way or another.</p>
<p>Recently, the Sage YMCA of Metro Chicago announced a new, temporary swim team format to return the Sage YMCA Piranhas to the pool. These arrangements were developed without any input from the parent advisory council or coaching staff and the reaction from the members was bitter disappointment. This state championship and nationally ranked team knew the reality that returning to practice would not be the same as it was pre-pandemic, but they did not expect a plan as the one presented. The leadership at the Sage YMCA of Metro Chicago attributes the outcry from its swim community as overzealous and unsafe. But the real story pre-dates the global pandemic that the YMCA is using as a smokescreen.</p>
<p>The truth is the decisions and actions of the YMCA of Metro Chicago have been nothing short of their quest to eliminate a “swim team that has been a problem for years” according to one local director at the facility. Let us reiterate that last fact. The actions taken by the leadership at the Sage YMCA to malign an important program in the lives of many young members began long before COVID-19 came to light. This program, built by generous community donors, talented coaching staff, dedicated volunteers and most importantly the children who benefitted from it, have been targeted by YMCA leadership.</p>
<p>They tell us the program is too much of a strain on the operating budget of this facility when, in fact, it is self-sustaining and profitable. They raise fees despite being among the most expensive YMCA team fees in the area. They refuse to let the team take their turn at hosting the Northwest District Championship meet under the guise that it’s too disruptive to members when, in fact, the true reason is that they wished for a fee higher than is customarily paid to the host facility. The Northwest District meet is rotated through several area YMCAs and is a huge fundraising arm for swim teams. To deny this team the ability to receive funds over the reported “disruption to the other members” while stating the team does not bring in enough revenue is contradictory. The team is asked to host this district-wide meet one weekend every three years in a rotation with other Illinois YMCAs for which not only the team, but the Sage YMCA facility is financially compensated.</p>
<p>This past year the leadership at the Sage YMCA restricted meets to start after noon citing the disruption to members and week-end swim lessons even though lessons are held in a separate pool and the team already parks offsite at a neighboring business. While we acknowledge that the large crowds a swim meet brings 4 or 5 weekends throughout the year can be challenging, it is certainly not an unusual occurrence in other YMCA centers. The team complied when told they could not hold their meets during the customary time frames of 8 am to 4 pm. This resulted in a huge inconvenience to the families, visitors, volunteer officials and swimmers. Races children expected to participate in had to be eliminated in order to make the meets fit this abbreviated timeline. The lights constantly went off in the middle of the meet because the competition had to extend past the usual facility closing time.</p>
<p>What has happened to this team over these past years has been nothing short of a travesty. Instead of using this program as a shining example for other area Metro Chicago centers it has been systematically silenced and extinguished. This did not happen due to COVID-19 no matter how many times they say it. This happened when you take a dedicated swim coach who fully embodies what the YMCA is supposed to stand for and ignore him. This is what happens when you dismiss your loyal members and their contribution to the YMCA community. This is what happens when you sacrifice your local center’s most successful youth program due to it being an inconvenience. Most importantly, this is what happens when you use children as pawns of corporate bureaucracy.</p>
<p>These actions have caused members of the largest YMCA swim team in the state of Illinois to cancel their memberships and move on to other organizations. This mass exodus has nothing to do with the new format of the swim practices, or the cautious return to opening, but rather a culmination of the examples cited above and many many other instances when the center’s leadership refused to work in partnership with the team. This final swim team practice plan announced by the executive director and spearheaded by the aquatics director had zero input from the head coach, or any member of the coaching staff was the tipping point. Numerous emails from parents were ignored.</p>
<p>The Sage YMCA of Metro Chicago is trying to portray us as petulant children who are walking away because we did not get our way. This is not the case. This is important. This is a teachable moment to our youth and to the community. This is how we stand up to an organization who ignores the principles it is supposed to embody.</p>
<p>It is our responsibility to speak up for the membership and to the donors who helped build this outstanding competition facility and to question how the YMCA is living up to its promise to the young members. The youth of the Sage YMCA facility rely on this team not only for fitness but for building self-esteem, social interaction and mentorship. We will do our due diligence to inform the community who helped build the facility that their generous donations have been cast aside.</p>
<p>The spirit of this swim community has been crushed. It was never about swimmers needing more time in the pool or the restrictions to minimize the inconvenience to the other members. It is about the total disregard for what these members have contributed to the YMCA mission and the absolute unprofessional and unacceptable way the Sage YMCA leadership have maligned the mission of this team.</p>
<p>Coach Ed Richardson has been a venerated swim coach in Northern Illinois for more than 30 years. His contributions to the sport are second only to his impact on the youth who participated. From the novice one-season swimmer to the Olympic hopeful he has touched more lives than can be counted. While his titles and accomplishments highlight his career, what follows him most are his former students and athletes. The stories are endless. The impact immeasurable. We could write a book filled with inspirational stories, but we simply do not have enough paper on which to capture his generous spirit and love for the swim community.</p>
<p>It is true. Coach Ed Richardson resigned from the Sage YMCA of Metro Chicago on August 2, 2020 after what was surely a heart-wrenching decision. Despite his requests to assist with a plan to move forward, the leadership at the Sage YMCA refused to even respond. To continue with an organization that has treated him so callously in their determination to undermine the spirit of the Piranhas swim team was probably more than any swim coach could bear. The devastating impact on the children of this team is huge and the void left in their hearts is vast.</p>
<p>Our swim family was needlessly shattered. There would be no need for this letter and our team would be intact if the input from just one coach was sought in the development of this new swim league. Many other swim teams have been practicing safely over the recent weeks along with soccer leagues, baseball teams and drama camps. This award-winning coaching staff would have developed a training routine that this championship team would have adopted and thrived under. But to eschew the input from these talented and dedicated coaches is just another insult from the leadership at the Sage YMCA.</p>
<p>While the Sage YMCA will continue with its Piranhas swim team program many of us have chosen to resign our membership. While we pick up the pieces and go our separate ways the sorrow is deep and the loss palpable. With the lack of area pools there is no place for us to go together as a team and even individually we will struggle to find places due to the capacity limits COVID-19 brings. The monopoly the Sage YMCA holds over the local community and the lack of a public aquatics facility is the sad reality.</p>
<p>To belong to a non-profit entity that claims its “mission is to build strong kids, strong families and strong communities by enriching the lives of all people in spirit, mind and body” but sees its “swim team as a huge problem” is intolerable. But in the end, perhaps the YMCA achieved its stated mission–we ARE a team of strong kids, strong families and a strong swimming community, and we will go where we can live that mission fully.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Sage YMCA Piranhas Family
