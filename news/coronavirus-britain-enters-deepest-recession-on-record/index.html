<h3 id="uk-economy-enters-recession-after-record-20-slump">&ldquo;UK economy enters recession after record 20% slump&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dw.com/image/54538099_304.jpg" alt="img">
The UK on Wednesday officially fell into recession for the first time in 11 years. The economy collapsed by a record 20.4% in the second quarter, compared to the first quarter, as a result of coronavirus lockdown measures imposed to contain the outbreak.</p>
<p>Between April and June, household spending plunged as businesses were ordered to shut down, while industries such as construction rolled back on output and production.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has led to the biggest fall in quarterly GDP on record,&rdquo; Jonathan Athow of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.</p>
<p>Data from the ONS showed that the UK economy had a 2.2% quarterly contraction in the first three months of the year.</p>
<p>The technical definition of a recession is two straight quarters of economic decline.</p>
<p>The economic decline was concentrated in April — the peak of lockdown.</p>

<p>Read more:Germany&rsquo;s economy can&rsquo;t count on bouncing back fast</p>
<p>More job losses anticipated</p>
<p>The ONS said the economy bounced back in June as the government started to relax coronavirus restrictions.</p>
<p>Non-essential retailers in England, including clothes shops and bookshops, reopened their doors on June 15.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The economy began to bounce back in June with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and house-building continuing to recover,&rdquo; Athow said. But &ldquo;Despite this, gross domestic product (GDP) in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s service sector, which makes up four fifths of the economy, suffered the biggest quarterly decline on record. Car manufacturing, meanwhile, faced its slowest production rate since 1955.</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak warned that the economic slump would lead to further job losses in the coming months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s figures confirm that hard times are here,&rdquo; Sunak said. &ldquo;Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs, and sadly, in the coming months many more will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some 1.2 million employers have taken advantage of the government&rsquo;s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to furlough 9.6 million people at a cost to the government of 33.8 billion pounds ($44 billion, €38 billion).</p>
<p>Sunak said he is ending the program in October because it gives &ldquo;false hope&rdquo; to furloughed workers and hinders them from getting new jobs as their skills decline.</p>

<p>Lockdowns strike European economies</p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s recession is deeper than those recorded by comparable countries such as the US and other European economies, notably Germany and France.</p>
<p>Germany&rsquo;s governing coalition in June agreed on a €130 billion stimulus package to help pull the country&rsquo;s economy out of recession. The government hoped the package would ease Germans&rsquo; financial strain and boost consumer spending.</p>
<p>In comparison to other European countries, Germany&rsquo;s almost one month of lockdown was relatively short. But the German economy still went into recession in the first quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>Unemployment in May rose from 5.8% to 6.3%, figures which could have been higher if it were not for Germany&rsquo;s &ldquo;kurzarbeit&rdquo; program, a wage subsidy scheme that allows struggling companies to decrease employees&rsquo; working hours instead of making them redundant.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-largest-uk-recession-on-record---official-figures">&ldquo;Coronavirus: Largest UK recession on record - official figures&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://e3.365dm.com/20/05/1600x900/skynews-retail-shops-shut_4987784.jpg?20200511065849" alt="img">
The UK has been tipped into the &ldquo;largest recession on record&rdquo;, according to official figures charting the impact of the coronavirus crisis on the economy.</p>
<p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that the enforced hibernation of activity through the COVID-19 lockdown meant gross domestic product (GDP) slumped by 20.4% in the second quarter of the year following a dip of 2.2% during the first three months of 2020.</p>
<p>It determined that, by the end of June, the economy was a sixth below February&rsquo;s pre-crisis level - as a monthly recovery for growth, which began in May, gathered further momentum during June.</p>
<p>April proved the biggest drag as it was the first full month of curbs on non-essential businesses and services but was followed by month-on-month growth of 2.4% in May and 8.7% during June as restrictions were relaxed.</p>
<p>The effects of the lockdown have stoked a crisis for employment, with separate figures released on Tuesday showing the biggest slump for employment for more than a decade in the April to June quarter.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Data covering July showed 730,000 fewer people on payrolls since the lockdown started.</p>
<p>John Lewis, Boots, M&amp;S, British Airways, WH Smith and Debenhams have been among a wealth of well-known names cutting jobs to date, to save costs.</p>
<p>In its update on the economy on Wednesday, the ONS also pointed to a record fall in productivity during the second quarter of the year, as more than nine million workers were placed on furlough.</p>
<p>It measured that output per worker fell by a fifth compared with the first three months of 2020.</p>
<p>ONS deputy national statistician Jonathan Athow said: &ldquo;The recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has led to the biggest fall in quarterly GDP on record.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The economy began to bounce back in June, with shops reopening, factories beginning to ramp up production and house-building continuing to recover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite this, GDP in June still remains a sixth below its level in February, before the virus struck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Overall, productivity saw its largest-ever fall in the second quarter. Hospitality was worst hit, with productivity in that industry falling by three-quarters in recent months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Big downside risk&rsquo; for economy warns Bailey</p>
<p>The plunge in GDP currently leaves the UK second only to Spain in suffering the worst hit to output, among major economies, during the first six months of the year.</p>
<p>At 22.1% it is double the impact witnessed in the US.</p>
<p>Economists have pointed to the UK being particularly exposed because of its reliance on consumer spending - a point Rishi Sunak was quick to make during an interview with Sky News in which he defended the scale of the downturn but warned there was worse to come for employment.</p>
<p>Is the UK set for a prolonged recession?</p>
<p>The Chancellor said: &ldquo;I said (months ago) hard times were coming and today&rsquo;s numbers show that hard times are here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their job and many more will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I would say though is difficult decisions do lie ahead for all of us but I want to reassure people we will get through this and nobody will be left without hope and opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He signalled the government had put lives first but added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a sustainable situation to have vast swathes of our economy essentially shut down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why we have been able to successfully reopen bits, and do it in a safe way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as people get back to going shopping, or going out for a meal, or indeed getting back to their office, they will see that it&rsquo;s a new normal, it&rsquo;s a safe normal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blanchflower: V-shaped recovery is for the birds</p>
<p>In response, Labour accused the government of bungling the battle against COVID-19.</p>
<p>Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds tweeted: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already got the worst excess death rate in Europe - now we&rsquo;re on course for the worst recession too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a tragedy for our country and it&rsquo;s happening on the PM&rsquo;s watch. A downturn was inevitable after lockdown - Johnson&rsquo;s jobs crisis wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the worst may be over for economic growth, it is inevitable that the worst is yet to come for jobs.</p>
<p>Last week, the Bank of England forecast a better-than-expected pick-up in growth but said it would take until the final quarter of 2021 for the economy to regain its previous size.</p>
<p>It is expecting the unemployment rate, currently at 3.9% to hit 7.5% by the year&rsquo;s end as the furlough scheme is wound down.</p>
<p>Analysis: &lsquo;The scale of this economic contraction is unlikely ever to be repeated&rsquo;</p>
<p>By Ed Conway, economics editor</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s official.</p>
<p>Britain is in recession. Except that this is unlike any recession any of us have experienced. It&rsquo;s the deepest recession in modern British history. It&rsquo;s the deepest of any other leading industrialised economy (only Spain&rsquo;s economy shrank by more in the first half of 2020).</p>
<p>Indeed, this is the deepest recession since the invention of gross domestic product as an economic concept back in the 1930s.</p>
<p>In one sense the fall is not surprising: we were in lockdown for most of the second quarter, so it was always likely that economic output would fall sharply during that period. The lockdown began in the first quarter and intensified in the second, and given the standard definition of a recession is two successive quarters of contraction, it was plain a while back that we would face a recession.</p>
<p>Even so, the scale of it is quite something: a 20.4% fall in output in the second quarter - almost double the fall in most other advanced economies. It puts UK economic output back to the level it was in 2003: 16 years of growth and prosperity wiped out in the space of six months.</p>
<p>Except that&rsquo;s not quite right, because this is no normal recession in another respect too. Mostly, recessions are thrust upon countries and governments. This recession was, at least in part, a confected one: a lockdown designed to clamp down on activity and bring COVID-19 under control. And the good news is that much of that economic output should come back pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Indeed, delve deeper into the figures released by the Office for National Statistics today - into the month-on-month growth rates, and you can see the early signs of that rebound.</p>
<p>Monthly GDP actually rose by 8.7% in June, the biggest monthly increase since records began. It&rsquo;s nowhere near enough to bring the level of income across the economy back to where it was before COVID-19 struck - indeed it still leaves GDP 17.2% shy of its pre-crisis level. Still: for those who hope this will be V-shaped recovery, with a very quick rebound back to normality, it is a start.</p>
<p>Economic statistics are mostly the equivalent of a rear-view mirror. These GDP numbers are history, albeit recent history - a cliff edge and a canyon we are now pulling out of. The abiding question now is what happens next. Does the UK economy recover, or does economic activity drag on at a weaker rate for the foreseeable future? And, inextricably linked, what happens if there&rsquo;s a second surge in COVID-19 infections: does it prompt another lockdown or semi-lockdown, with all the associated consequences?</p>
<p>Most economists suspect that whatever happens, unemployment will rise even more sharply than after the financial crisis in 2008, making this the biggest jobs crisis since the 1980s. In the end, that statistic - unemployment - may prove more significant and meaningful than a double digit fall in GDP.</p>
<p>The scale of this economic contraction is unlikely ever to be repeated. It will take some time before we understand the precise shape of the curve: the ONS constantly revises these numbers over time, so it might be that the fall was less deep, or maybe deeper. Is this the worst recession since 1921 or since the early 18th century? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>It is likely that it is an unusually short lived recession, if only because the fall was so sharp that any return to a semblance of normality would involve an increase in output.</p>
<p>Even so, it is a baleful moment for the UK. It might just be a statistic, it might not be the best measure of personal wellbeing or equality, but GDP is still about the most comprehensive metric of a country&rsquo;s welfare. It is simply the sum total of everything we buy, sell or earn. And we have never seen it collapse like this before.

<p><img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%2Fimages%2F3%2F5%2F8%2F3%2F28773853-3-eng-GB%2FCropped-1597195164%E5%86%99%E7%9C%9F%E9%83%A8%E8%B3%87%E6%96%99%EF%BC%89%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%82%BB%E3%82%A4%E3%83%91%E3%82%B7%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E8%88%AA%E7%A9%BA%E3%81%AE%E6%A9%9F%E4%BD%93%E6%A9%9F%E4%BD%9320200812101455336_Data.jpg?source=nar-cms&amp;width=1024&amp;height=512&amp;fit=cover&amp;gravity=faces" alt="img">
HONG KONG &ndash; Cathay Pacific Airways has reported a record net loss of nearly $1.3 billion for the first half of the year under the impact of the coronavirus pandemic which has grounded all but a small fraction of the group&rsquo;s passenger flights.</p>
<p>The carrier&rsquo;s 9.87 billion Hong Kong dollar ($1.27 billion) loss was aggravated by hedging contracts for fuel set when no one could have imagined oil futures trading at prices below zero. A year earlier, the company generated a net profit of HK$1.35 billion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first six months of 2020 were the most challenging that the Cathay Pacific group has faced in its more than 70-year history,&rdquo; said Chairman Patrick Healy in a statement accompanying the results. &ldquo;We do not expect to see a meaningful recovery in our passenger business for some time to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Revenue dropped 48.3% to HK$27.67 billion as higher charges to carry freight offset some of the group&rsquo;s vanished passenger revenue.</p>
<p>Investors, who had been warned of the impending loss in mid-July, took the loss in stride, pushing Cathay shares up 12% to HK$5.88 in trading on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a feeling among investors that the worst is behind Cathay Pacific,&rdquo; said Kenny Wen, market strategist at brokerage Everbright Sun Hung Kai, noting market talk about COVID-19 vaccines and the opening of transfer connections to Chinese cities via Hong Kong International Airport.</p>
<p>Passenger revenue fell 72.2% in the half-year to HK$10.4 billion. Passenger yield, a measure of the average fare collected, managed to rise 1.1% to 55.5 Hong Kong cents even as the few passenger flights operating had more empty seats than usual. The group&rsquo;s full-service airlines, Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon, operated just 3% of normal capacity during April and May but that proportion is set to rise to 10% this month.</p>
<p>Still, Healy said that the group had moved a third of the passenger planes it had parked in Hong Kong to storage in Alice Springs, Australia, adding, &ldquo;We are in discussions with other locations as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s cargo revenue rose 8.8% to HK$11.18 billion in the first half. Although the group&rsquo;s freight capacity was reduced by a nearly a third due to the grounding of passenger flights that normally carry about half of Cathay&rsquo;s cargo traffic, cargo yields rose 44.1% to HK$2.71 due to high demand. Air Hong Kong, the group&rsquo;s freight-only unit, turned a profit of HK$363 million, up 8.3%.</p>
<p>While the fall in fuel prices, as well as usage due to the grounding of many flights, generated a HK$8.97 billion benefit for Cathay overall, its bottom line would have fared better if not for previously arranged supply contracts set to hedge against the possibility of fuel inflation. Such contracts, tied to an average price for Brent crude of more than $62 a barrel and covering 40% of the group&rsquo;s normal consumption, inflicted a HK$1.6 billion loss on Cathay as Brent fell as low as $16.</p>
<p>Given the group&rsquo;s outlook for fuel consumption and prices in the July-September quarter, Chief Financial Officer Martin Murray told reporters that the group had recorded a HK$95 million charge in relation to fuel deliveries for that period but said that &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t envisage future losses at this time&rdquo; from hedging activity beyond this quarter. Added Healy, &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be adjusting the hedging policy,&rdquo; stressing that such contracts have helped the group to iron out fuel price volatility.</p>
<p>Cathay said its results reflected receipt of HK$1.06 billion in COVID-related aid from various governments as well as HK$2.47 billion in accounting charges related to 16 jets it now expects will not &ldquo;reenter meaningful economic service again.&rdquo; Cathay shareholders last month approved a HK$39 billion bailout led by the Hong Kong government.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Express, the group&rsquo;s budget flight unit, incurred a loss of HK$779 million as it grounded all flights for half the period. The carrier resumed operations on Aug. 2, but public broadcaster RTHK reported Wednesday that two of its planes collided during a towing operation at Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Following reports that the owner of Donghai Airlines, a carrier based in the neighboring city of Shenzhen, had applied to start a new Greater Bay Airlines in Hong Kong, Healy said it was &ldquo;great to see other people with confidence in the future of the Hong Kong aviation hub as much as we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following Cathay&rsquo;s acquisition of Hong Kong Express last year, the group has just one locally based competitor, struggling Hong Kong Airlines.

<h3 id="its-official-this-is-phoenixs-hottest-summer-ever-recorded">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s official: This is Phoenix&rsquo;s hottest summer ever recorded&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/08/06/PPHX/71f0baef-4d4d-4b78-8f61-d35613c13f9e-IMG_3343.JPG?crop=2595,1460,x0,y0&amp;width=2595&amp;height=1460&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
It&rsquo;s official: This is now the hottest Phoenix summer to date ever on record.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service in Phoenix broke the news Tuesday afternoon with a few fun facts:</p>
<p>The average maximum temperature this summer has been 107.9 degrees. Runners-up are 107.6 degrees in both 1989 and 1978.</p>
<p>The average temperature this summer has been 96 degrees. Runners-up are 95.4 degrees in 2016 and 95.3 degrees in 2006.</p>
<p>The average minimum temperature this summer has been 84.2 degrees, tied with the same temperature in 2006 and followed by 83.7 degrees in 2016.</p>
<p>The record stands for as far back as records have been kept on Phoenix weather, which is 1895. The news comes days after Phoenix broke another weather record for having the most 110-degree days in a year, at 35 as of Monday.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not only Phoenix that&rsquo;s hotter than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We’re definitely seeing temperatures way up there on the statewide level,&rdquo; said meteorologist Austin Jamison with the Weather Service.</p>
<p>So, why is this happening?</p>
<p>The same weather pattern that is preventing the Valley from getting monsoons is also preventing us from getting cloud cover or humidity at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have humidity in the air, some of the sun’s energy goes into heating up the water vapor, but with the lack of water vapor it just goes to heating up the air,&rdquo; Jamison said. &ldquo;If you had a lot more humid air, the temperature is not going to be as high even though you had the same amount of sun energy getting in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another reason: the urban heat island effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That’s very well established with the accumulation of man-made materials, these artificial, heat-retaining materials that make nighttime temperatures for sure significantly warmer than they would be compared to natural desert or agricultural land,&rdquo; Jamison said.</p>
<p>Phoenix&rsquo;s concrete, asphalt and buildings retain heat, keeping the city hotter through the night.</p>
<p>MORE ON WEATHER: Phoenix tying records for highest low temperatures</p>
<p>&ldquo;On top of that there is a broader signal of climate change where it’s not just Phoenix, it’s not just the urban effects. Places that don’t have near the urbanization over the years have been seeing upward trends in temperatures. When it comes to Phoenix, it’s not simply global warning, but that is a factor,&rdquo; Jamison said.</p>
<p>An excessive-heat warning starts Wednesday morning for most of metro Phoenix and will run through Monday evening, meaning it will be very hot even by local standards. Afternoon temperatures are expected to be 107 to 116 degrees, according to the warning.</p>

<p><img src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2020/08/12/2d1e7fce-069e-4cf2-8010-2b701799a792/thumbnail/1200x675/b2269d9a80738e4f3a014df462362484/brayden-point.jpg" alt="img">
Watch Now: NHL First Round Picks: Lightning vs Blue Jackets ( 2:23 )</p>
<p>There have only been three other games in NHL history that outlasted Tuesday&rsquo;s marathon of a game between the Columbus Blue Jackets and Tampa Bay Lightning. In the fifth overtime of Game 1 of the First Round Stanley Cup Playoff series, Lightning forward Brayden Point finally ended the game as he snapped the puck past Joonas Korpisalo to give Tampa Bay a 3-2 victory.</p>
<p>The goal came as the puck deflected off of Blue Jackets defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov&rsquo;s leg and right onto the stick of Point.</p>
<p>It was Point&rsquo;s second goal of the game, with the earlier tally coming in the opening period &ndash; six hours prior. The goal was Point&rsquo;s first career playoff overtime goal and his first postseason multi-goal game.</p>
<p>Theatrics were certainly a theme throughout the game. The Lightning forced overtime as they tied the game at 2-2 with just 23.0 seconds remaining in regulation.</p>
<p>The Lightning were fighting to keep their hopes of a win alive late in the third period. Tampa Bay forward Barcay Goodrow showed off his hustle as he beat out defenseman David Savard to cancel the icing call. The puck ended up on the stick of star defenseman Victor Hedman, who ripped a one-timer that Korpisalo couldn&rsquo;t control. It was loose in front before Yanni Gourde jammed it home to tie the game.</p>
<p>While Point&rsquo;s goal was the deciding factor, the best player on the ice had to be Korpisalo, who stopped a playoff record 85 shots in defeat. The Blue Jackets netminder broke the playoff record of 73 saves that was previously set by former New York Islanders goalie Kelly Hrudey in 1987.</p>
<p>Korpisalo broke the record early in the fourth overtime period with his 74th stop.</p>
<p>This comes after Korpisalo produced another sensational performance in Game 5 of the Blue Jackets&rsquo; qualifying round series against the Toronto Maple Leafs. In a must-win game, Korpisalo stopped 33 shots in the Game 5 victory and also was named the first star of the game for his efforts. It also marked the second shutout in the qualifying round for Korpisalo.</p>
<p>After former Blue Jackets goalie Sergei Bobrovsky signed with the Florida Panthers in free agency, Korpisalo became the starting goaltender in Columbus. Korpisalo started a career-high 35 regular season games before the NHL was forced to halt play due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Finnish goaltender posted a 19-12 record with a 2.60 goals-against-average during that time.

<h3 id="seth-jones-sets-nhl-record-for-most-ice-time-in-a-game">&ldquo;Seth Jones sets NHL record for most ice time in a game&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/russianmachineneverbreaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/seth-jones.jpg?fit=904%2C490&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
The fourth longest game in NHL history, the August Epic, broke more than one record on Tuesday. Before the game ended in 5OT, Columbus defender Seth Jones set the record for most ice time in a single game.</p>
<p>He skated over an hour.</p>
<p>The record once belonged to hall-of-fame defender Sergei Zubov, who clocked just under 64 minutes in a 2003 playoff game.</p>
<p>Now the record belongs to Jones, 25. From the NHL and as of like 10 minutes into the EIGHTH period:</p>
<p>“I feel fine,” Jones, 25, told the media after the game, seeming not at all like just played more hockey than any professional ever has. “Lot of minutes obviously.</p>
<p>“[I] tried to stay hydrated through the full thing.”
