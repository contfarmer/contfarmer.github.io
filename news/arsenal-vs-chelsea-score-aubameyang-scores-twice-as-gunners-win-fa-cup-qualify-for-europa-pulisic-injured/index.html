<p>Arsenal came from behind to beat Chelsea on Saturday in the FA Cup final, 2-1, qualifying for the Europa League as a result. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored both goals for the Gunners, one on either side of halftime. Chelsea&rsquo;s American star Christian Pulisic scored but left the game due to injury.</p>
<p>Pulisic scored just five minutes in to give the Blues early control, but Aubameyang scored a penalty kick in the first half and then put home a brilliant winner in the 67th minute that was a bit controversial due to a possible foul in the build-up. Chelsea finished the game with 10 men following Mateo Kovacic&rsquo;s questionable red card in the second half, earning his second yellow for a challenge on Granit Xhaka.</p>
<p>The result is a massive one for the Gunners, who finish the season with a trophy, qualify for Europe and get revenge on their fellow London club after losing the Europa League final to them last season.</p>
<p>Here are three takeaways from the match:</p>
<p>Arsenal deserved result despite poor officiating</p>
<p>In the end, Arsenal was the deserved winner for a few reasons. Aside from Aubameyang taking his chances, the club was simply sharper. The defense, which has long been a problem, played quite well. The Blues lacked creativity and Arsenal took control as the game went on. Now, there is no doubt the Gunners benefited from the officiating more than Chelsea did. There was the foul in the box by Cesar Azpilicueta to concede a penalty kick, which could have been given as a free kick outside the box, but that call was fine in the end.</p>
<p>Then there was the second goal from Arsenal where Hector Bellerin looked to have fouled Andreas Christensen in the build up, but it wasn&rsquo;t given. Check out the finish though:</p>
<p>Kovacic&rsquo;s red card was harsh, because he didn&rsquo;t step on Xhaka. He actually was the one that got stepped on, and it&rsquo;s baffling that VAR didn&rsquo;t intervene.</p>
<p>In the end, Arsenal did what it had to do, but the calls went their way as well, and they&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>Who had the better season?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the seasons between the two, shall we?</p>
<p>Chelsea: Qualified for Champions League with top-four finish in Premier League</p>
<p>Qualified for Champions League with top-four finish in Premier League Arsenal: Won FA Cup, qualified for Europa League</p>
<p>Sure, Chelsea is still in the Champions League where it will face Bayern Munich in the round of 16 second leg trailing 3-0, but up until Saturday, the Blues were having the superior campaign.</p>
<p>It is all about hardware for these clubs, and Saturday&rsquo;s result pushes Arsenal ahead when you look at the entire season. Sure the Blues were far better in the Premier League, but the Gunners won the match that mattered most. For Mikel Arteta, who became Arsenal&rsquo;s manager in December, it was a dream end to the campaign and also increases expectations for next season.</p>
<p>Blues showed nothing after Pulisic&rsquo;s injury</p>
<p>Chelsea with Pulisic on the pitch is like a roaring lion recently. Without him, the Blues are more like a cute little lion cub. There is just no bite without Pulisic in the lineup. The Blues started off strong with his goal and looked to have taken command of the game before conceding the penalty kick. But the moment Pulisic came off, the club no longer looked like a threat. Part of it was a lack of sharpness and Ross Barkley&rsquo;s inability to pass, but it just goes to show how vital he is to the team. Without him, it seems impossible for a come back against Bayern Munich next week in the Champions League.</p>
<p>Arsenal 2, Chelsea 1 (FT)</p>
<p>⚽ Chelsea: Christian Pulisic (5&rsquo;)</p>
<p>⚽ Arsenal: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Penalty kick - 28&rsquo;)</p>
<p>⚽ Arsenal: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (67&rsquo;)

<h3 id="arsenal-vs-chelsea-aubameyang-brace-hands-gunners-fa-cup-europa-league-spot">&ldquo;Arsenal vs Chelsea: Aubameyang Brace Hands Gunners FA Cup, Europa League spot&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Image-4-5.jpg" alt="img">
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang came good on the night that mattered as he scored a brace to help Arsenal beat Chelsea 2-1 on Saturday night and clinch the FA Cup. Not just that, they also sealed their spot for the Europa Cup with the historic win at Wembley Stadium.

<p>But things did not start the way they would have hoped for as Christian Pulisic took full advantage of a nervy Arsenal to break the deadlock in merely the fifth-minute of the match. It was Mason Mount who send a low ball into the box, which was then flicked into Pulisic’s path by Oliver Giroud, and then a quality chip over the goalkeeper by the United States player was all it took.

<p>With the goal, Pulisic became only the second United States international to score in an FA Cup final, following in the footsteps of Carli Lloyd – who did the same in 2017 for Manchester City. Also Read - PSG Beat Lyon Via Penalties to Win French League Cup</p>
<p>Since then Arsenal looked to be on the back foot. In the 28th-minute, thanks to a penalty, Arsenal got things back on level terms. It was Cesar Azpilicueta who brought Aubameyang down in the box and that earned the Gunners the penalty.</p>
<p>Both sides went into half-time with the scores leveled. After the half-time, it was Aubameyang once again in the 67th-minute and this time the goal proved to be the winner.</p>
<p>“I have to say thank you to Pep in every way because I am a manager now in big part thanks to him,” Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta told BT Sport after the match.

<p><img src="https://www.skysports.com/assets/favicon.ico" alt="img">
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored twice as Arsenal came from behind to beat 10-man Chelsea 2-1 and win the FA Cup for a record 14th time at Wembley Stadium.</p>
<p>Chelsea took the lead after five minutes thanks to a brilliantly-taken strike from Christian Pulisic - who became the first American to score in an FA Cup final.</p>
<p>But Arsenal equalised shortly before the half hour as captain Aubameyang won and then perfectly converted his 28th goal of the season from the penalty spot.</p>
<p>Chelsea lost captain Cesar Azpilicueta and Pulisic to hamstring injuries either side of the interval and fell behind on 67 minutes when Aubameyang lifted a stunning second over Willy Caballero.</p>
<p>Chelsea hopes were extinguished six minutes later when Mateo Kovacic was sent off for a second bookable offence, as Arsenal used their numerical advantage to secure the first trophy of Mikel Arteta&rsquo;s tenure and a place in next season&rsquo;s Europa League.</p>

<p>Man of the Match: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</p>
<p>How Aubameyang inspired Arsenal at Wembley</p>
<p>Image: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang&rsquo;s double sealed Arsenal&rsquo;s record 14th FA Cup final victory</p>
<p>Aubameyang and Mason Mount registered early efforts in a lively start at Wembley, which culminated in Chelsea taking the lead with just five minutes on the clock.</p>
<p>Team news Hector Bellerin replace Joe Willock in Arsenal’s only change from their final-day Premier League victory over Watford.</p>
<p>Chelsea were unchanged from their final-day Premier League victory over Wolves. Kepa Arrizabalaga and N’Golo Kante started on the bench, while Willian was absent from the matchday squad.</p>
<p>Former Gunners striker Olivier Giroud&rsquo;s clever flick released Pulisic into the box, where the American skipped past Kieran Tierney before slotting his 11th goal of the season past Emiliano Martinez.</p>
<p>Image: Christian Pulisic fired Chelsea into a fifth-minute lead</p>
<p>Chelsea remained in the ascendancy as Arsenal took their time to grow, but the Gunners looked to have introduced themselves in spectacular fashion when Nicolas Pepe&rsquo;s curled strike nestled in the top corner.</p>
<p>The Arsenal celebrations were short-lived though, with Aubameyang caught offside in the build-up, but seconds later the Gunners captain raced onto a ball over the Chelsea defence before being hauled to ground by Azpilicueta.</p>
<p>Image: Cesar Azpilicueta fouls Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for an Arsenal penalty</p>
<p>The Chelsea skipper was shown a yellow card by referee Anthony Taylor, whose decision to point to the spot was upheld by VAR, and Aubameyang clinically dispatched his fourth goal in two FA Cup appearances this season from 12 yards.</p>
<p>The loss of Azpilicueta to a serious-looking hamstring injury confirmed a torrid couple of minutes for Chelsea, who were under the cosh and thankful to reach the break level having lost all of their early momentum.</p>
<p>Chelsea weathered the loss of Pulisic within seconds of the restart with a dominant spell as they looked to reassert their authority, but a moment of brilliance from Aubameyang fired the Gunners in front for the first time.</p>
<p>Hector Bellerin&rsquo;s burst forward and a rash challenge from Andreas Christensen diverted the ball into the path of Pepe, his pass found Aubameyang and the Gunners skipper skipped past Kurt Zouma before chipping a sublime second over Caballero.</p>

<p>Kovacic&rsquo;s second yellow for a foul on Granit Xhaka and subsequent dismissal effectively ended Chelsea&rsquo;s hopes of overturning Arsenal&rsquo;s lead, and a late shoulder injury to Pedro in his final game for the Blues was the final act of Chelsea&rsquo;s capitulation as the cup slipped out of their hands.</p>
<p>Opta stats: Arsenal&rsquo;s FA Cup love affair continues</p>
<p>Arsenal have won the FA Cup for a record 14th time, while they&rsquo;ve also become the first club to beat a specific opponent in as many as three finals in the competition.</p>
<p>Mikel Arteta has become the first person to both captain and manage Arsenal to victory in an FA Cup final.</p>
<p>Arsenal have won each of their last seven FA Cup final appearances since 2002 - no team has had a longer run of successive final triumphs in the competition.</p>
<p>Chelsea have lost three of their last 10 FA Cup final matches, with all three defeats coming against Arsenal.</p>
<p>Mikel Arteta is the first Arsenal manager to win a major trophy in their first season in charge of the club since George Graham in 1986-87.</p>
<p>What the managers said…</p>
<p>1:15 Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta says Saturday&rsquo;s FA Cup final victory over Chelsea was the proudest moment of his career.</p>
<p>Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta: &ldquo;Big games require big moments from big players. Aubameyang delivered that in the semi-final, he&rsquo;s done it again in the final and that&rsquo;s why you ask about those players.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people were questioning whether he could do it in big games, but he was a big part in delivering this trophy. We&rsquo;re so proud to have a player like him in our squad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think [it&rsquo;s the proudest moment of my career]. I&rsquo;m really proud of what we&rsquo;ve achieved as I know the difficulties and everything we&rsquo;ve been through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so tough the last six months for a lot of things that have happened in our lives, but I had only one mission when I came here which was to make the players and the staff believe that we could do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1:57 Chelsea head coach Frank Lampard admitted his side were not good enough in Saturday&rsquo;s FA Cup final defeat to Arsenal as he bemoaned losing so many of his players to injury.</p>
<p>Chelsea manager Frank Lampard: &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t play well enough. We didn&rsquo;t play great for us, but we did compete in the game and we had chances. When you give an opportunity like that to Aubameyang, he will finish you off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aubameyang scores two goals - one being a penalty - and we were very clear with the players about the threat that Arsenal provide with long balls behind you. They play football as well, but they also have a threat of a long ball behind you, particularly in those channels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A frustrating part of today&rsquo;s game was that I showed that a lot to the players and we worked on it, but we allowed him in easily. He&rsquo;s a top-class player, and the second goal is the sort of speed and quality of a player at this level that wins games like these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Man of the Match - Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</p>
<p>Aubameyang has been crucial to Arsenal&rsquo;s development under Arteta and it was fitting the Gabon international&rsquo;s double sealed his first piece of silverware since taking charge.</p>
<p>Two goals in the semi-final were followed by two in the final as Aubameyang became the first Arsenal player since 1950 to score an FA Cup final brace.</p>
<p>After his exploits at Wembley, if clear that Arteta hopes of pushing on for greater prizes in the future hinges on the Gunners&rsquo; ability to keep hold of the Gabon international.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next?</p>
<p>Chelsea face Bayern Munich in the last-16 of the Champions League on August 8 at 8pm.</p>
<p>Arsenal will play Premier League champions Liverpool in the Community Shield at Wembley on August 29. The kick-off time for the game will be announced at a later date.</p>
<p>Arsenal and Chelsea are back in Premier League action next month, with the 2020/21 season kicking off on September 12.

<h3 id="fabregas-reveals-roy-keanes-reaction-after-injuring-him-during-arsenal-vs-man-utd">&ldquo;Fabregas reveals Roy Keane&rsquo;s reaction after injuring him during Arsenal vs Man Utd&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://gmsrp.cachefly.net/images/20/07/31/b481715ccc123d6e853458b81af6a0ff/1200.jpg" alt="img">
Who will Cesc Fabregas be supporting tomorrow?</p>
<p>The Spanish midfielder made a name for himself at Arsenal, making more than 300 appearances for the club and becoming one of the best passers in world football.</p>
<p>A three-season stint at Barcelona followed before he returned to London - but this time with Chelsea despite Arsenal having the first refusal.</p>
<p>Four successful seasons followed at Stamford Bridge with Fabregas lifting two league titles, an FA Cup and a League Cup.</p>
<p>So, who does Cesc want to win the FA Cup final tomorrow?</p>
<p>Well, he’s admitted that he’d prefer it if Arsenal won because they “need it more.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arsenal need it more. Chelsea basically every year has won a trophy, so it&rsquo;s a different animal in this case,&rdquo; Fabregas told the Telegraph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In terms of trophies, Arsenal needs it more and for confidence for next year and getting into Europe. Chelsea are in the Champions League and Arsenal has nothing at the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fabregas also won the FA Cup with Arsenal in 2005 after beating Manchester United on penalties and, in the same interview, remembered coming out on top in a tackle with Roy Keane during that match.</p>
<p>It seems Keane didn’t take too kindly to a young Spaniard leaving one on him in a challenge.</p>
<p>And Cesc recalls what compatriot Gerard Pique told him about Keane’s reaction at half-time.</p>
<p>“Gerard Pique, who was at Manchester United then, told me about this afterwards and I never knew about it,” Fabregas began.</p>
<p>“He told me that me and Roy went into a challenge, which I remember. It was 50/50 and I must have caught him with my knee in his quad. And I got him a little bit.</p>
<p>“At half-time, he went to Pique and started shouting at him because he knew we were friends. A bit of swearing. I can&rsquo;t say the exact words but it was fun.”</p>
<p>Check out the challenge below:</p>
<p>You wouldn’t expect anything less from Keano, would you?</p>
<p>After a 0-0 draw after 120 minutes, Arsenal triumphed on penalties after Paul Scholes missed the only spot-kick of the game.</p>
<p>It proved to be the only trophy Fabregas won at Arsenal - other than a Community Shield earlier that season.</p>
<p>But he’s hoping the Gunners can claim the trophy for a record 14th time when his two former sides meet at Wembley tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="arsenal-vs-chelsea-menang-2-1-the-gunners-juara-piala-fa">&ldquo;Arsenal Vs Chelsea: Menang 2-1, The Gunners Juara Piala FA&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://akcdn.detik.net.id/api/wm/2020/08/02/arsenal_169.jpeg?wid=54&amp;w=650&amp;v=1&amp;t=jpeg" alt="img">
Arsenal berhasil meraih gelar Piala FA musim ini. Menghadapi Chelsea di final, The Gunners menang 2-1.</p>
<p>Di Wembley, Sabtu (1/8/2020), Arsenal sempat tertinggal lewat gol cepat Christian Pulisic di menit ke-6. Namun akhirnya mereka yang tersenyum belakangan usai mencetak dua gol lewat Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang di menit ke-28 dan 68.</p>
<p>Dengan hasil ini, maka Arsenal berhak lolos ke Liga Europa musim depan. Kemenangan ini juga menjadi gelar pertama Arsenal di bawah asuhan Mikel Arteta.</p>
<p>Sedangkan bagi Chelsea, kekalahan ini membuat mereka nyaris tanpa gelar di musim ini. Mereka masih bertanding di leg kedua 16 besar Liga Champions melawan Bayern Munich pada 8 Agustus, namun butuh keajaiban untuk bisa membalikkan keadaan setelah takluk 0-3 di leg pertama.</p>
<p>Jalannya pertandingan</p>
<p>Arsenal mengancam lebih dulu di menit ke-3 lewat Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, namun sundulannya masih melebar. Chelsea membalas semenit berselang lewat sepakan Mason Mount, namun bisa diselamatkan kiper Arsenal, Emiliano Martinez.</p>
<p>GOL! Chelsea unggul cepat di menit ke-6. Memanfaatkan umpan bakcheel Olivier Giroud, Christian Pulisic menerobos lini belakang Arsenal sebelum melepaskan sepakan yang mengecoh Martinez. 1-0 untuk The Blues.</p>
<p>Arsenal tak tinggal diam. Mereka hampir saja menyamakan kedudukan di menit ke-7, namun tembakan Nicolas Pepe berhasil diamankan Willy Caballero.</p>
<p>Chelsea pun tak lantas mengendurkan serangan. Hampir saja skor berubah menjadi 2-0, andai akselerasi Pulisic yang berujung tembakan keras tak dihalau oleh Martinez di menit ke-11.</p>
<p>PENALTI! Arsenal mendapat hadiah penalti di menit ke-26 usai Aubameyang dilanggar oleh Cesar Azpilicueta. Aubameyang sendiri yang maju sebagai eksekutor, dan ia berhasil menjalankan tugasnya. Skor menjadi imbang 1-1, yang bertahan hingga turun minum.</p>
<p>Di babak kedua, Chelsea menekan duluan. Pulisic hampir mencetak gol keduanya di laga ini, namun tembakannya di menit ke-47 tidak menemui sasaran.</p>
<p>Demikian pula dengan Arsenal. Granit Xhaka mendapat peluang di menit ke-58, tapi tembakannya juga masih melebar.</p>
<p>GOL! Arsenal berbalik unggul di menit ke-68. Lewat serangan balik yang dibangun Hector Bellerin, bola akhirnya sampai di kaki Pepe, lalu diumpan ke Aubameyang yang kosong. Berhasil melewati penjagaan Kurt Zouma, Aubameyang lalu melepaskan tembakan lob terukur yang bersarang di gawang Chelsea.</p>
<p>KARTU MERAH! Upaya Chelsea menyamakan kedudukan kian terjal setelah Mateo Kovacic diusir wasit di menit ke-73 setelah menginjak kaki Xhaka.</p>
<p>Dalam keadaan tertinggal dan kalah jumlah pemain, semangat Chelsea belum luntur. Namun mereka gagal menciptakan peluang di sisa waktu. Upaya kian sulit setelah Pedro Rodriguez cedera di masa injury time babak kedua, sehingga Chelsea hanya bermain dengan 9 orang.</p>
<p>Hingga peluit panjang dibunyikan, skor tetap 2-1 untuk Arsenal.</p>
<p>Susunan Pemain</p>
<p>Arsenal: Emiliano Martinez, Rob Holding, David Luiz (Sokratis Papastathopoulos 88&rsquo;), Kieran Tierney (Sead Kolasinac 90+13&rsquo;), Hector Bellerin, Granit Xhaka, Dani Ceballos, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Nicolas Pepe, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette (Eddie Nketiah 82&rsquo;).</p>
<p>Chelsea: Willy Caballero, Cesar Azpilicueta (Andreas Christensen 35&rsquo;), Kurt Zouma, Antonio Ruediger (Callum Hudson-Odoi 79&rsquo;), Marcos Alonso, Jorginho, Mateo Kovacic, Reece James, Christian Pulisic (Pedro Rodriguez 49&rsquo;), Olivier Giroud (Tammy Abraham 78&rsquo;), Mason Mount (Ross Barkley 79&rsquo;).</p>

<p>Kenya boasts of a huge number of fans following the European football leagues, with the England&rsquo;s Premier League and Uefa Champions League the most popular.</p>
<p>Every weekend across the country, fans throng pubs, restaurants and video joints to catch a glimpse of their favourite clubs playing.</p>
<p>However, the joy and energy witnessed at these joints where fans in their favourite team jerseys jump up and down shouting will not be witnessed today when Arsenal take on Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley from 7.30pm.</p>
<p>This is after President Uhuru Kenyatta banned the sale of alcohol in all restaurants and ordered all bars closed indefinitely in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>And when the Standard Sports did a round up many fans were disappointed to be missing the opportunity to support their teams together with their friends.</p>
<p>David Mwaura, an Arsenal fan based in Eldoret said the energy of fans watching in a pub or restaurant is what makes the game even more interesting with the hype surrounding it.</p>

<p>“Nothing matches watching a game with friends in a pub. The energy is wild and there is happiness everywhere despite the final result and we are going to miss that but we understand the global health threat and I guess home is the place to be,&rdquo; Mwaura said.</p>
<p>In Kisumu, Silas Okello, an ardent Chelsea fan said he will be forced to watch the game online through his phone with the ban on bar affecting him since he doesn’t have PayTV.</p>
<p>“The ban on these joints affects not only me but a majority of Kenyans who don’t own DStv, GoTV or Startimes. I love football and even if it means parting away with Sh100 of data bundles I will do that to support my team,” he said.</p>
<p>In Mombasa, Fadya Ali, an Arsenal fan said she will watch the final with her family at home.</p>
<p>“Coronavirus is real and its time to stay home with family and friends. I support the president’s directive and I think it is time we made it enjoyable watching at home,&rdquo; she said.

<p>Arsenal vs Chelsea: Match stats</p>
<p>Arsenal are appearing in their 21st FA Cup final, more than any other side. Indeed, the Gunners have won the competition more often than any other side (13).</p>
<p>Chelsea are playing in their 14th FA Cup final, with this their seventh appearance in the showpiece since Wembley Stadium re-opened in 2007. The Blues have won seven of their last nine FA Cup finals, with both defeats in that time coming against Arsenal.</p>
<p>This season’s FA Cup final will be the latest date a final has been staged in the competition’s history.</p>
<p>This is the third time Arsenal and Chelsea have faced each other in the FA Cup final, with the Gunners winning the previous two (in 2002 and 2017) – no fixture has been played more in the final (excluding replays).</p>
<p>Arsenal have triumphed in eight of their last nine FA Cup final matches, including each of the last six in a row. Only Tottenham (7 between 1901 and 1982) have won more consecutive FA Cup final appearances.</p>
<p>Chelsea have won just one of their last 13 FA Cup games against Arsenal (D4 L8), beating them 2-1 in the 2009 semi-final, courtesy of goals from Florent Malouda and a late Didier Drogba winner.</p>
<p>This will be the third time in the last four seasons that Arsenal will be ending their campaign against Chelsea, winning the 2017 FA Cup final and losing last season’s Europa League final against the Blues in Baku.</p>
<p>In all competitions, Chelsea have lost just two of their last 10 meetings with Arsenal (W3 D5), with the Blues unbeaten against the Gunners in the Premier League this term (W1 D1).</p>
