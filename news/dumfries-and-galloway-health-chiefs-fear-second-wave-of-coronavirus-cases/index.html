<p>Dumfries and Galloway has recorded the lowest number of coronavirus cases in mainland Scotland.</p>
<p>But health chiefs have warned that the low infection rate means there is “very little immunity” among residents.</p>
<p>And they are urging people to guard against complacency and maintain social distancing rules.</p>
<p>A spokesman for NHS Dumfries and Galloway said: “We are still in a precarious position with regards to Covid-19.</p>
<p>“This is a highly transmissible virus with potentially devastating consequences and we have a population in Dumfries and Galloway which has had very little exposure and therefore has very little immunity.</p>
<p>“We have seen how quickly the virus can spread, despite best preventative efforts.”</p>
<p>He added: “We know that rates of coronavirus have been relatively low in Dumfries and Galloway but this isn’t the case everywhere else in the country.“</p>
<p>National Records of Scotland data shows that the region has experienced 300 Covid cases and 47 deaths since the start of the crisis.</p>
<p>The NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde board area has been worst hit, seeing 4,957 confirmed cases for the period up until July 28.</p>
<p>Dumfries and Galloway become the only mainland Scottish health board area to report no new Covid-19 cases this week. The area joins communities in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney as the only board areas where none were uncovered.</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by south of Scotland MSP Colin Smyth who said: “It’s encouraging that cases continue to fall in our region and, while our rurality makes a big difference, so too do our actions.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen first-hand in Dumfries and Galloway that this terrible virus is still out there and we cannot become complacent. While the further lifting of lockdown measures this week will be welcomed by many, we must take precautions to keep ourselves and our communities safe. We need to continue to act responsibly and use common sense.</p>
<p>He added: “The fall in cases will be little consolation for families who sadly lost loved ones to Covid-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must never forget this pandemic has killed many people in our region and ultimately saving lives is the most important consideration in everything we do.”</p>
<p>The health board spokesman said: “We would ask people to please consider the risks before travelling outside the region and to continue to observe measures that we know can reduce your chances of catching the virus: face coverings in enclosed spaces, avoiding crowded places, cleaning hands and surfaces regularly, two metre physical distancing and self-isolate and and book a test if you develop coronavirus symptoms.”

<p>A council has &ldquo;missed the window of opportunity&rdquo; to continue its fight with nuisance town centre gulls this year.</p>
<p>The Dumfries and Galloway local authority offers an egg and nest removal scheme in and around Dumfries.</p>
<p>However, a contractor was not able to be appointed due to coronavirus restrictions.</p>
<p>The council said the eggs had now hatched, meaning the opportunity to run the scheme had passed and the project would now be subject to review.</p>
<p>Image caption In previous years eggs and nests have been removed from buildings</p>
<p>Dumfries has long-standing issues with urban gulls swooping and taking food, as well as noise and mess problems.</p>
<p>Last year, local football team Queen of the South threatened to evict fans caught feeding the birds.</p>
<p>The egg and nest removal scheme has been offered for more than a decade and costs more than £20,000 a year to operate.</p>
<p>It has been credited with gathering &ldquo;vital information&rdquo; which has been shared with scientists and other local authorities.</p>
<p>Analysis: By Giancarlo Rinaldi, BBC news website south of Scotland reporter</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images</p>
<p>In the early days of lockdown, the streets of Dumfries appeared to be missing a familiar sound.</p>
<p>Without many of their usual food sources, the squawk of the gulls was absent.</p>
<p>However, their noise has increased significantly in recent weeks as life returns to the town centre.</p>
<p>The egg and nest removal scheme was credited with reducing issues in the area.</p>
<p>Further studies will now need to assess what impact its absence has had on bird numbers in the town.</p>
<p>The total number of breeding pairs in or near Dumfries had been driven down from its peak - but remains higher than when the project started.</p>
<p>Numbers in the town centre, however, had been cut significantly with the scheme intended to run again this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had to suspend the project due to the coronavirus restrictions and therefore we did not appoint a contractor to do this work,&rdquo; said a council statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had already applied for the licence from Scottish Natural Heritage and this was granted: therefore we were able to remove some eggs and nests on our own properties under the authority of the licence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have unfortunately missed the window of opportunity for egg and nest removal as eggs have now hatched, but we&rsquo;re using this period to review the project and assess how it would be most effectively delivered in future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A report will go to its communities committee at a later date.

<p>Council bosses will have to fork out £2.25m to send kids back to classrooms full-time in August.</p>
<p>The cash-strapped authority outlined the sum as the cost to “facilitate the return to schools”.</p>
<p>A recovery curriculum will be in place to focus on wellbeing, mental health and the principles of the Scottish Government’s getting it right for every child strategy.</p>
<p>The authority has also vowed to support vulnerable pupils and those at transition points in education.</p>
<p>Risk assessments on the reopening of school buildings were carried out in June.</p>
<p>An enhanced cleaning regime will be undertaken, with the authority moving to a daytime cleaning model.</p>
<p>They will continually clean higher-risk areas including toilets, door handles and switches.</p>
<p>A mobile unit task force will also be created to battle a surge in demand for cleaning services caused by issues such as staff absence or a suspected case of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Running the upgraded regime until December alone will cost the authority around £240,000.</p>
<p>A report prepared for the full meeting of the council yesterday said: “Subject to continued suppression of the virus and to surveillance and mitigations being in place, the balance of the evidence suggests that no distancing should be required between children in primary schools.”</p>
<p>Measures needed for older pupils are described as “less clear” but the document concludes: “At present we support the same approach being taken in primary schools on the basis of the balance of known risks and the effectiveness of mitigation.”</p>
<p>A two metre distancing rule will remain in place where possible between adults and between adults and children who are not from the same household.</p>
<p>The authority faces particular challenges in providing transport for pupils, although Scottish Government is that physical distancing measures are unnecessary on school buses as long as infection rates remain low.</p>
<p>But advice from Transport Scotland says schoolchildren on public transport should wear face masks and employ physical distancing where possible.</p>
<p>Estimated costs for school transport until the October break sit at £328,000 as long as social distancing measures are not necessary.</p>
<p>Around £178,000 of the sum is earmarked to provide transport for more than 400 pupils who normally use public buses.</p>
<p>The council is preparing for a return to school on August 12 and the First Minister announced yesterday that schools across Scotland should aim to return by August 18 at the latest.

<p>A tatty donated book with a coffee cup stain has become a “life-saver” and record-breaker for a Dumfries charity shop.</p>
<p>The 1916 first edition of Irish writer James Joyce’s first novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man lay in a storeroom at the Oxfam store for two years.</p>
<p>And the valuable book was only spotted by a keen-eyed volunteer as a result of the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>The shop, now open, had been shut due to lockdown and the helper was going through the stored books to see if there were any that could be sold online.</p>
<p>It was snapped up this week by a Canadian buyer for £800.</p>
<p>Store manager Rory Fairweather said: “With gift aid of £200 that makes it worth £1,000 to Oxfam, a new record for our shop which has been open more than 40 years.</p>
<p>“It is a real hidden gem which has raised enough money to help keep hundreds of people in refugee camps well fed and safe from Covid-19. This book is a life-saver.”</p>
<p>The novel was handed in to the store as part of “an incredibly generous donation” of books from the library of a radio playwright Donald Yerrill by his family.</p>
<p>Mr Yerrill wrote for the Times Literary Supplement and set over 10,000 cryptic crosswords under the name Tantalus for many years. He died in Dumfries Infirmary in 2016 at the age of​ 92.</p>
<p>Due to the very poor condition of the book, it was put to one side and sat in storage for around two years until lockdown.</p>
<p>Rory said: “It was in a really bad way but, as it was a first edition and by James Joyce, the volunteer spotted it as something worth price-checking and it went up online and has sold this week.</p>
<p>“We never imagined it would be worth so much and are all absolutely delighted.”</p>

<p>A band of Dumfries youngsters fought the ultimate battle of good versus evil last weekend.</p>
<p>The game fans took on a gameathon to raise cash for cancer charity Macmillan.</p>
<p>And they smashed their £250 target by raising more than £800 for the organisation.</p>
<p>Calside youngster Aimee Kippen was joined by 10-year-old school pals Isla Anderson, Finlay Hiddleston and Reuben Barr, as well as Archie Anderson, 12.</p>
<p>The quintet, calling themselves Calside Gaming Heroes, played online over the weekend to complete the 24-hour challenge.</p>
<p>They showed off their skills against rivals in the hit game Fortnite and undertook Minecraft challenges.</p>
<p>And the battle paid off as the youngsters raised £836 for Macmillan, smashing their lower target.</p>
<p>Aimee’s proud mum Lorna Kippen told the Standard: “Aimee’s dad had spotted something online about doing a</p>
<p>24-hour gameathon for charity and mentioned it to Aimee.</p>
<p>“She is just at that age where she loves gaming anyway and she really wanted to do it.</p>
<p>“I spoke to the other parents and, because most of the kids are 10, we decided they should do it over the weekend rather than 24 hours straight through.</p>
<p>“We scheduled time when they exercise and rest breaks so there was always one playing.”</p>
<p>But the dedicated youngsters did not want to give up the challenge at hand, added Lorna: “We said on the Saturday they would game from 8am until midnight but when we got to midnight Aimee wanted to keep going so her and Isla kept playing. There was always at least one playing and they also played as a team.”</p>
<p>Tesco Extra donated water, fruit and cereal bars to keep the youngsters going.</p>
<p>Delighted Lorna added: “They were all really buzzing with the amount of money they managed to raise.</p>
<p>“They put an app on their phones so they could track the money and there were lots of donations coming in at the weekend while they were doing it.”

<p>The notoriously difficult clothing sector was also left badly hit after retailers were forced to close their doors at the start of their summer season after stock of new fashions had been ordered.</p>
<p>But despite lockdown presenting a retailing challenge, one Dumfries store owner says he has been buoyed by the support of his customers.</p>
<p>Jim Wilson, of men’s clothing retailer Moduals, told how his regulars have been key to a successful exit from lockdown.</p>
<p>He said: “With lockdown the timing wasn’t great for us, we were just approaching the spring/summer season and had bought all our stock. We had laid out a lot of money and were then forced to shut.</p>
<p>“The timing also didn’t help because of the seasonal aspect. It was frustrating for us as a store, if it was going to last for any period at all then we were full of summer stock and when we come back we are heading to it almost being autumn.</p>
<p>“We’ve been in Dumfries for four years and we are totally local, for local people. We don’t sell online and we stock a lot of top brands like Hugo Boss.</p>
<p>“We have built up a really good relationship with our customers partly because of some of our ethics and the fact we don’t sell to randoms online.”</p>
<p>It is this relationship that has supported the business through the pandemic.</p>
<p>Jim said: “We had some correspondence on Facebook with our customers and we used the postal service to send out goods initially and did it all by post. Then when things relaxed a bit, we went out and did deliveries and that got a great reaction.”</p>
<p>The goodwill Jim’s business has built up over the years had also served him well since he returned to trading.</p>
<p>He added: “We reopened on June 29 and it’s been phenomenal, the loyalty we have had has been great.</p>
<p>“I’ve had people who’ve spent £400 or £500 at a time.”

<h3 id="inspectors-praise-high-performing-dumfries-prison">&ldquo;Inspectors praise &lsquo;high performing&rsquo; Dumfries prison&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/181DB/production/_113697789_20160128_091322.jpg" alt="img">
Inspectors have praised a &ldquo;high performing&rdquo; Scots prison as being &ldquo;safe and well-run&rdquo;.</p>
<p>They said incidents of violence at the Dumfries site were &ldquo;very low indeed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, they did voice concerns about the lack of accessible cells for prisoners with disabilities at the facility built in the 19th Century.</p>
<p>The Scottish Prison Service said it was aware of that issue and it was working on ways to &ldquo;find solutions&rdquo; to the problems raised.</p>
<p>The HM Inspectorate of Prisons for Scotland report said inspectors had been impressed by many aspects of how the prison was managed and operated.</p>
<p>In particular they flagged up:</p>
<p>Work to prevent relapses with drug and alcohol issues</p>
<p>Staff-prisoner relationships which were &ldquo;almost universally considered to be positive&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good quality&rdquo; employment and training opportunities</p>
<p>The prison being &ldquo;one of the cleanest&rdquo; they had ever visited.</p>
<p>Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland Wendy Sinclair-Gieben said: &ldquo;The whole prison worked with a slickness that was impressive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is the best inspection that my inspectorate team have done in all of my tenure and they deserve praise for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report said that &ldquo;inevitably&rdquo; there were areas where work was needed, &ldquo;some as a direct consequence of the age of the buildings&rdquo;.</p>
<p>These included the lack of accessible cells for prisoners with disabilities.</p>
<p>The development of a visitor centre was also described as &ldquo;advantageous and in line with best practice elsewhere in the estate&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The report concluded there was &ldquo;no doubt&rdquo; that the Dumfries prison was operating well under &ldquo;strong visible leadership&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;HMP Dumfries can take pride in the positive endorsement of all their efforts that this report represents,&rdquo; it said.</p>
<p>The Scottish Prison Service welcomed the findings of the report on the south of Scotland facility.</p>
<p>A spokesman said the issue of accessibility was partly attributable to the age of the buildings - the prison was built in 1863 - alongside the age of many of the prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are aware that going forward we are going to have to find solutions to this,&rdquo; he added.
