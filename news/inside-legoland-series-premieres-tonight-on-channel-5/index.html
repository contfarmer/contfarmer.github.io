<p>UK fans can enjoy the first episode of Inside LEGOLAND: A World of Wonder at 8.00pm on Channel 5 tonight.</p>
<p>A documentary camera crew has been following the operation of LEGOLAND Windsor Resort for the last two years and tonight viewers can enjoy the first episode of the new series. It airs on Channel 5 at 8.00pm.</p>
<p>Here is an extract from the press release, providing a taste of what tonight’s episode will feature:</p>
<p>Viewers will meet LEGOLAND Windsor’s expert team of Model Makers who between them are responsible for building, refining and updating the thousands of LEGO models across the Park. Made up of over 90 million LEGO bricks, there’s always a job to be done from replacing the fences at Buckingham Palace in Miniland to overseeing the new hippos – made from 5,000 LEGO bricks each – be transported to their new home by the lake. Viewers will also follow the newest member of the Model Maker team, Will, as he embarks on his first day in one of the most sought-after roles at the Park.</p>
<p>On one of the hottest days of last summer, cameras were there as families flocked in their hundreds to earn their driving licence at the much-loved LEGOLAND Driving School before cooling down on the water slides and dodging the fountains at Drench Towers. But behind the scenes viewers will see just what it takes to keep the rides running as temperatures rise under the watchful eye of the Park’s Technical Services team.</p>

WINTER HAVEN, Fla. – Legoland Florida has welcomed the arrival of a new display that is “out-of-this-world.”</p>
<p>What You Need To Know Legoland Florida add Lego astronaut model</p>
<p>Model made out of nearly 66,000 Lego bricks</p>
<p>Previously on display at Kennedy Space Center</p>
<p>The Winter Haven theme park is now home to a life-size astronaut model made out of nearly 66,000 Lego bricks. The model, which is on display in the park’s Imagination Zone, stands in front of a mosaic background made out of 44,000 Lego bricks.</p>
<p>The model was built last year, taking the five model builders 143 hours to complete. Before landing at its permanent home at Legoland this week, the astronaut model was first displayed at Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission.</p>
<p>Legoland Florida reopened its resort on June 1 with new health and safety measure, including temperature checks, increased cleaning protocols and capacity limits. Prior to reopening, Legoland Florida closed in mid-March in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

<h3 id="legoland-to-require-face-masks-as-winter-haven-enacts-emergency-ordinance">&ldquo;Legoland to require face masks as Winter Haven enacts emergency ordinance&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.clickorlando.com/resizer/bq3f9fzXYVIc0gOqHBmzabUE7fE=/640x360/smart/filters:format(jpeg):strip_exif(true):strip_icc(true):no_upscale(true):quality(65)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/W4TBPR32OBAYDIM7D22UCOP3YM.jpg" alt="img">
WINTER HAVEN, Fla. – If you’re planning a trip to Legoland or Winter Haven, you’ll now need to pack a face mask to help curb the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>On Monday, Winter Haven commissioners unanimously voted to enact an emergency ordinance that would require “every person working, living, visiting, or doing business in the City of Winter Haven” to wear a face mask in any indoor space, other than an individual’s home, when social distancing is not possible.</p>
<p>The ordinance goes into effect at 5 p.m. Tuesday.</p>
<p>[RELATED: These Central Florida cities, counties have face covering requirements]</p>
<p>The city defined a face mask as “a uniform piece of material that securely covers a person’s nose and mouth and remains affixed in place without the use of one’s hands, whether store-bought or homemade, consistent with CDC guidelines.”</p>
<p>Exemptions to required face mask use under the emergency ordinance include:</p>
<p>Persons under the age of eight years old</p>
<p>Persons observing social distancing in accordance with CDC guidelines</p>
<p>Persons for whom a face covering would cause impairment due to an existing health condition</p>
<p>Persons working in a business or profession who do not have interactions with other persons</p>
<p>Persons working in a business or profession who maintain social distancing from other persons</p>
<p>Persons working in a business or profession where use of a face covering would prevent them from performing the duties of their business or profession</p>
<p>Persons exercising, while maintaining social distancing in accordance with CDC guidelines</p>
<p>Persons eating or drinking</p>
<p>Persons under the age of eighteen years old while participating in youth sports</p>
<p>Public safety, fire and other life safety and health care personnel, as their protective equipment requirements will be governed by their respective agencies</p>
<p>Persons communicating with someone who is hearing impaired where the wearing of a face covering would impede communication, provided that social distancing is observed to the greatest extent practicable</p>
<p>Persons for whom the requirement to wear a face covering would cause a conflict with the Americans with Disabilities Act</p>
<p>According to the emergency ordinance, anyone found to not be in compliance with the order could be fined $150.</p>
<p>The ordinance will expire at 5 p.m. on Aug. 14 unless rescinded or extended by further action of the city commission.</p>
<p>Since Legoland falls under Winter Haven city limits, the theme park will now require guests to wear a face mask to be in compliance with the emergency ordinance. Previously, the theme park strongly recommended and encouraged face masks to be worn inside the park, but the use of face coverings will now be mandatory.</p>

<p>“Facial coverings are required in all indoor locations across the resort as well as on all rides in the Theme park for all guests eight (8) years and older. While at our resort, we recommend and encourage guests to bring and wear masks for everyone’s safety but we will have disposable masks available, including kid’s sizes, for pick-up on-site as well. For the water park, masks are only recommended for use when they are dry,” park officials said on the theme park’s website.</p>
<p>In addition to face masks, Legoland outlined the following health and safety measures being taken:</p>
<p>Non-invasive temperature checks are required for all guests, including children, and model citizens (employees) before entering the park.</p>
<p>Families or parties that include persons with an elevated temperature (at 100.4º F or above) will not be admitted.</p>
<p>Height checks for all of our rides and attractions will be conducted at the front gate and kids with some room still to grow will receive a wristband to indicate which rides they are eligible to ride</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Florida Department of Health reported a total of 7,881 cases of COVID-19 in Polk County since the disease was first detected in the state on March 1, as well as 151 deaths and 596 hospitalizations in the area.</p>

Television viewers will get a glimpse behind the scenes of Leogland resort in a new documentary.</p>
<p>The four-part series will give audiences an intimate look at the theme park through interviews with model makers, hotel housekeepers and roller coaster designers.</p>
<p>“We’ve been welcoming families to Legoland Windsor for over two decades and we thought it was about time we let the nation go behind the scenes to see what’s involved, and the secret tricks and tips, in keeping a 150 acre theme park and two hotels running around the clock,” said Marianne McGoldrick, marketing director at Legoland.</p>
<p>The series was filmed over five months last summer and the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Viewers are introduced to the theme park’s expert model making team as they replace fences at Buckingham Palace in Miniland, watch families cool off at Drench Towers on the hottest day of 2019 and witness the events team race to display 3,000 pumpkins across the park for Halloween.</p>
<p>“Having reopened at the start of July, we’ve already helped thousands of families have some much-needed fun after a difficult few months and we hope that Inside Legoland: A World of Wonder will inspire plans for a Great British day out or staycation this summer,” Marianne added.</p>
<p>The park reopened on July 4 with a reduced number of pre-booked guests and social distancing measures in place.</p>
<p>Legoland: A World of Wonder will air on Channel 5 at 8pm on Sunday.

<p><img src="https://townsquare.media/site/705/files/2020/07/legoland-construction.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=0&amp;zc=1&amp;s=0&amp;a=t&amp;q=89" alt="img">
LEGOLAND is still coming.</p>
<p>In a promotional video released on Thursday, LEGOLAND New York in Goshen announced that construction has resumed. A representative from the massive theme park enthusiastically exclaimed, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no better feeling than seeing our team back together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crews are busy building a mammoth 150-acre theme park that was scheduled to open earlier this month. In March LEGOLAND made the decision to push back that opening until 2021 due to construction shutdowns and the fear that social distancing would continue through the summer.</p>
<p>The video released this week acknowledged that things have not gone as planned, but the park is still scheduled to open in 2021. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a tough time for all of us,&rdquo; one of the representatives says. Footage provided in the clip shows major progress being made throughout the theme park. Rides are assembled in some locations and large buildings are going up.</p>
<p>When LEGOLAND opens next summer, it&rsquo;s certain that the park will be focusing on safety and making sure it will be ready to accommodate social distancing, if necessary. While describing the park, one of the announcers promises that it will be a place &ldquo;where you and your family will feel safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many local residents already purchased season passes in anticipation of this summer&rsquo;s opening. LEGOLAND made their appreciation known by ending the video with a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to those enthusiastic LEGO fans for their &ldquo;support, patience and trust.&rdquo;</p>

Ahead of Inside LEGOLAND: A World of Wonder debuting on Channel 5 tomorrow evening, a clip has been shared giving a taste of what the programme will offer.</p>
<p>In a new clip from Inside LEGOLAND, which begins tomorrow evening on Channel 5 at 8.00pm, new Model Maker Will gets some help from his colleague, April, to install a new fence at Miniland’s Buckingham Palace model. The four part series promises to reveal what goes on behind the scenes at LEGOLAND Windsor Resort, from Miniland touch-ups to attraction malfunctions.</p>
<p>The series has been filmed at LEGOLAND Windsor Resort during 2019 and 2020, revealing “what it takes to keep one of the UK’s favourite family theme parks running and be introduced to some of the 1,800-strong workforce who work tirelessly to create childhood memories that last a lifetime.”</p>
<p>In the first episode, fans will get a glimpse into what the Model Makers do, as they build, refine and update the brick built models that feature throughout the theme park. Tasks include the tiny, such as replacing the fence at Miniland’s Buckingham Palace, to the huge, such as relocating life-sized LEGO hippos.</p>
