<p>Dear President and Vice-Chancellor Lenton,</p>
<p>We, the undersigned, demand that Associate Professor Faisal Bhabha no longer teach any “human rights” courses at York University’s Osgoode Hall Law School.</p>
<p>As you acknowledged in your letter of June 2, antisemitism remains a concern for many Jewish community members at York. Now is your chance to take action against antisemitism.</p>
<p>Mr. Bhabha twice asserted that “Zionism is about Jewish supremacy,” which he linked to white supremacy in the United States. The notion that Zionism, which merely calls for Jewish statehood in the Jewish homeland – no different than most other national movements – is a uniquely evil form of “supremacy,” is a false and dangerous allegation.</p>
<p>Mr. Bhabha’s twisting of Zionism rhetorically transforms hundreds of thousands of Canadian Jews into “Jewish supremacists.”</p>
<p>Worse yet, Mr. Bhabha also stated that “Accusing Israel of exaggerating the Holocaust could be, for some, a plausible argument.” This is a preposterous canard with no supporting evidence.</p>
<p>The notion that the world’s only Jewish State may have “exaggerated” the murder of 6-million Jewish men, women and children is likely to sow hatred and division where no basis for it exists.</p>
<p>Any version of human rights that does not include a firm rejection of antisemitism is ethically and morally bankrupt. Students at York University and Osgoode Hall Law School deserve better.</p>

<h3 id="why-ghislaine-maxwells-arrest-could-turn-up-the-heat-on-prince-andrew">&ldquo;Why Ghislaine Maxwell&rsquo;s arrest could turn up the heat on Prince Andrew&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5644963.1594395547!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/prince-andrew.jpg" alt="img">
Hello, royal watchers. This is your regular dose of royal news and analysis. Reading this online? Sign up here to get this delivered to your inbox.</p>
<p>When British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested in New Hampshire last week on charges related to the investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, it cast renewed attention on a royal friend to them both: Prince Andrew.</p>
<p>Partway through the news conference following Maxwell&rsquo;s arrest by the FBI on July 2, Audrey Strauss, the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said she would &ldquo;welcome Prince Andrew coming in to talk with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Attention has focused on Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s second son particularly in connection with an accusation from one of Epstein&rsquo;s young victims: that Maxwell arranged for her to have sex with Andrew at her townhouse in London.</p>
<p>Andrew and the palace have repeatedly denied the story, and in a deposition, Maxwell has said the victim, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, was &ldquo;totally lying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still, the arrest puts a renewed spotlight on Andrew, who bowed out of royal duties last fall after a disastrous interview with the BBC over his friendship with Epstein, who died of suicide while in custody in New York last summer.</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s arrest &ldquo;may very well turn up the heat on [Andrew] because the big question now is what does she know and what kind of deal is she willing to make with the prosecutors,&rdquo; said Robert Currie, a law professor in the Schulich School of Law at Dalhousie University in Halifax and a specialist in international and transnational criminal law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a big fight already about whether she&rsquo;s covered by Epstein&rsquo;s own 2008 immunity agreement when he pleaded down to some lesser charges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prof. Trevor Farrow of Osgoode Hall Law School at York University in Toronto also thinks the recent charges brought against Maxwell could complicate things for Andrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If other people are getting charged and coming forward &hellip; the circle seems to be tightening around those who were involved,&rdquo; Farrow said. &ldquo;If he can credibly claim that he had no idea what was going on, that will be one thing. If it&rsquo;s something different, the circle seems to be closing in on those directly involved in all of these activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So far, it has been a rather confusing legal scene playing out publicly around Andrew and the Epstein case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My impression of what&rsquo;s happened so far is this: The American prosecutors have said a number of times: &lsquo;We want to interview you, we want testimony from you, not in-court testimony, but we want an actual interview where we ask you questions and you give us answers on the record in some way,'&rdquo; Currie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His team, I gather, has pushed back with, &lsquo;We are willing to give you a written statement.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Against that backdrop, reports have emerged that the American lawyers have turned to the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between the U.S. and the U.K.</p>
<p>Currie said that under that treaty, &ldquo;British government officials could essentially compel Prince Andrew to come into a room and give testimony under oath, sworn statements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If that were to happen, it could mean further legal issues for Andrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is in a room with American prosecutors answering questions, the case has immediately got a lot more tricky for him,&rdquo; Currie said. &ldquo;That is why we&rsquo;ve seen these seven months of back and forth, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not co-operating,&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, I am.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Currie, the case is emblematic of something we&rsquo;re going to see more of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are more mobile than they ever were, evidence is more mobile than it ever was and more and more criminal cases of every stripe are going to have these cross-border elements to them,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Zooming with William and Kate</p>
<p>Staff at Surrey Memorial Hospital take part in a Zoom call with Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, in June. A portion of the call was posted online on July 1. (Kensington Palace)</p>
<p>The likelihood of a royal visit to Canada any time soon seems slim to nil, but staff at a British Columbia hospital recently came as close as anyone could to an encounter with the House of Windsor.</p>
<p>The Royal Family&rsquo;s online efforts to support front-line workers during the COVID-19 pandemic reached Surrey Memorial Hospital, as Prince William and Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, did a Zoom call with two doctors, two nurses, a respiratory therapist and a social worker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was inspiring in many ways,&rdquo; intensive care physician Dr. Gregory Haljan said in an interview. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all been through a lot of phone calls and meetings lately and working virtually, and this was actually a very warm and engaging conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half-hour virtual chat took place in late June, and a seven-minute sampling of the exchange was posted online by Kensington Palace on Canada Day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The conversation was very wide-ranging, everything from talking about mental health right down to some of the granular details around things like contact tracing,&rdquo; said Haljan, who is head of the critical care department at Surrey Memorial. &ldquo;They were very well informed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the conversation, William told the front-line workers he and Kate were &ldquo;proud of all of you and of everyone on the front line who has led the way very stoically and very bravely, and put patient care right at the top of the list. You&rsquo;ve done a fantastic job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>WATCH | Prince William and Kate talk with staff at Surrey Memorial:</p>
<p>Kate told them: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an amazing role that you&rsquo;re playing and a hugely tough one as well. We&rsquo;re in huge admiration of everything you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The health-care staff prepared for about five days before the call, practising and getting comfortable on Zoom.</p>
<p>Haljan said there was some nervousness among the group for the call that began at 7 a.m PT, but William and Kate &ldquo;really did a wonderful job of putting us at ease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think everyone really enjoyed the conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haljan sees it as the kind of conversation that is more important than ever right now, a time when there is a lot of division in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things that bring us together, things that bring the best out of us &hellip; those positive words, that positive energy, are incredibly important right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hospitals provided care for the majority of patients requiring hospitalization for COVID-19 in B.C.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->We are incredibly proud of the response from our staff, medical staff, leaders and our partners, some sharing recently with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@KensingtonRoyal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->https://t.co/VyYEmWbWpe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> —@Fraserhealth</p>
<p>Surrey Memorial saw the most COVID patients of any hospital in B.C., and the staff on the Zoom call were all very much involved in working with them.</p>
<p>Haljan said they all left the conversation with William and Kate feeling better about what they have been through and inspired in their work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was helpful for us in terms of motivation to know there&rsquo;s attention being paid to all the hard work that&rsquo;s happening every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out and about — a bit more</p>
<p>Virtual visits like the one with Surrey Memorial became the regular way of doing royal business over the past few months, but there have been a few more hints recently of a return to meeting and greeting in person — from a safe distance.</p>
<p>Prince William went to a local pub in Norfolk as the U.K. moved into its next stage of reopening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As pubs and restaurants reopen around the U.K. this weekend, the Duke popped into the local pub in Norfolk to wish the staff well and hear how they have adapted their operations in order to allow them to return to a new normal,&rdquo; Kensington Palace said on Twitter and Instagram.</p>
<p>William and Kate also visited a hospital not too far from their country home in Norfolk on the weekend to mark the 72nd anniversary of the National Health Service.</p>
<p>Other members of the Royal Family, including Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, have also made public visits in recent days.</p>

<p>When Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip, Prince Charles and Princess Anne visited Canada in July 1970, the trip seemed to split into two distinct experiences.</p>
<p>First came a few days in the Northwest Territories to mark its centennial, a time of more relaxed events and quieter mingling with those they met. Charles even had a chance to pilot an Armed Forces Hercules on a 160-kilometre flight.</p>
<p>Then came Manitoba, where one crowd out to see the visitors reportedly numbered 100,000 as the province celebrated 100 years since its entry into Confederation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For northerners, it was a royal affirmation that their part of the country is a vital portion of the Canadian mosaic, an essential factor in Canada&rsquo;s sovereignty over the Arctic,&rdquo; the Winnipeg Free Press reported on July 16. &ldquo;For Manitobans, it was one hell of a grand way to blow out 100 birthday candles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trip was the first Canadian visit for Charles and Anne, and reportedly the first time members of the Royal Family had been north of the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p>There were lighter moments during the 10-day trip. Charles, the Winnipeg Free Press reported, told someone he didn&rsquo;t think he could dance to the music of The Guess Who, after the Winnipeg rockers of American Woman fame entertained the crowd at a youth dinner.</p>
<p>But some more serious issues that resonate today — relations with Indigenous communities, environmental concerns — were also top of mind at times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not men alone who must work with one another, but we must think of animals, rivers, lakes, trees, even plants, for they all contribute to a homogenous whole,&rdquo; the Queen said during a speech, reported by the Toronto Star. &ldquo;Everything in this world has its role to play if we are to continue to advance in peace and harmony.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="climate-change-risks-need-to-be-addressed-at-board-level">&ldquo;Climate change risks need to be addressed at board level&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.glaciermedia.ca/polopoly_fs/1.24167825.1594327288!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/facebookogimage_560_292/pollution.jpg" alt="img">
Company boards should be treating climate change the same way they have handled the COVID-19 crisis, a Canadian lawyer says.</p>
<p>That is to say, boards need to have information from management on the risks posed to an organization so they can make prudent and informed decisions, said Carol Hansell, a principal with McLaughlin Hansell Advisory Inc. and senior partner with Hansell LLP, which provides corporate legal, government relations and communications advice.</p>
<p>article continues below</p>
<p>As with COVID-19, if management is to manage climate change risk, it needs direction and resources from the board level, she said.</p>
<p>“If the board accepts the fact that climate change is a real and imminent risk, they need to say to management, ‘we need some information on how climate change is a real and imminent risk to this business,’” Hansell said.</p>
<p>Her comments in a July 9 webinar coming after her release of her ‘Putting Climate Risk on the Boardroom Table’ opinion released in June.</p>
<p>Hansell said there is now broad consensus among scientists, politicians and policy makers that climate change is real.</p>
<p>“Climate change has been so broadly acknowledged that boards of directors need to onboard that consensus and assess how climate change is affecting their business,” Hansell said. “A reasonably prudent person would be taking climate change risk into account as part of their risk register.”</p>
<p>What it comes down to, she said, is a simple test where duty of care requires each director to exercise care, diligence and skill.</p>
<p>“But to what standard?” she asked in the opinion. “That question is answered by the next phrase in the test – a director must exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise.”</p>
<p>And, she said, Canadian courts have taken judicial notice of that climate change consensus on “and the existential risks it poses or business.”</p>
<p>“They essentially said, ‘You don’t need to bother proving this to us,’” Hansell said.</p>
<p>Moreover, Hansell said, if a board of directors is not seen as reasonable in its decision making, a court would not defer to it.</p>
<p>And, Hansell said, directors need to be clear their first duty is to the organization rather than its stakeholders.</p>
<p>“We have yet to have case law on whether stakeholders like creditors or communities or environmental groups can say they are stakeholders that directors must take into account,” Hansell said.</p>
<p>Hansell said tools exist to assist boards in deliberations.</p>
<p>Hansell was clear that boards do not need a director brought specifically as an expert on climate change issues.</p>
<p>She said that became the case in 1999 when companies were worried about the Y2K issue, where havoc was expected in computer systems which only dealt with years in two digits rather than four – ie ‘99’ instead of ‘1999’ which would have dated things to the start of the last century – 1900 instead of 2000 - as the millennium changed.</p>
<p>“That created a board position with a single-subject matter person boards would defer to,” Hansell said.</p>
<p>“It was otherwise an empty chair at board meetings,” she said.</p>
<p>“Many, many boards in Canada are already doing a spectacular job.”</p>
<p>Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada director of corporate oversight and governance Gigi Dawe said the issue is one of many new areas directors have to wrangle with, including digitization, cybercrime and geopolitical considerations.</p>
<p>She said directors know banks, investors, regulators and other stakeholders are demanding boards consider climate change as part of their operational oversight.</p>
<p>“Boards are being given an unambiguous message that they need to step up to the plate,” Dawe said.</p>
<p>York University Osgoode Hall law school Prof Cynthia Williams said Hansell’s opinion builds on work done by Australian Noel Huntley who said climate related risks “represent foreseeable risks of harm to Australian businesses.”</p>
<p>Williams said many Canadian law firms have no issues with memos to boards saying climate change is real and an issue needing to be addressed.</p>
<p>The webinar was put on by Canada Climate Law Initiative, which examines the legal basis for corporations’ directors, officers and pension fiduciaries to consider, manage, and report on climate-related financial risks and opportunities. It also looks at advancing effective climate governance practice knowledge and exploring the scope and limits of fiduciary obligation limits around climate change.</p>

<h3 id="bnai-brith-calls-out-professor-for-comparing-zionism-to-white-supremacy">&ldquo;B&rsquo;nai Brith calls out professor for comparing Zionism to white supremacy&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/451952" alt="img">
B&rsquo;nai Brith Canada called for action to be taken against a university professor who repeatedly compared Zionism to the white supremacy movement in the United States.</p>
<p>The Canadian Jewish group wrote a letter the York University&rsquo;s president and Vice-Challancer where the associate professor Faisal Bhabha teaches Human Rights courses at the university&rsquo;s Osgoode Hall Law School. The letter petitions for Bhabha to be barred from teaching the subject.</p>
<p>“I’m equating white supremacy with Jewish supremacy,&rdquo; Bhabha reportedly said during an online debate event on June 10, according to B&rsquo;nai Brith Canada. The statement was made in answer to a panelist who challenged him for a prior comment he made during the debate where he said that, &ldquo;Zionism isn’t about self-determination, it’s about Jewish supremacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter also calls out Bhabha for his downplaying of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accusing Israel of exaggerating the Holocaust could be, for some, a plausible argument,&rdquo; the letter states Bhaba said, adding that he gave no apparent evidence for the comment.</p>
<p>Several days prior to the antisemitic incident, the university&rsquo;s president and vice chancellor Lenton wrote an open letter regarding the university&rsquo;s antisemitism policy.</p>
<p>“York is not immune from antisemitism, nor are we unique in grappling with its manifestations within our community. The University has been clear: we condemn antisemitism in all its forms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michael Mostyn, Chief Executive Officer of B’nai Brith Canada wrote in a public statement published by the Canadian group that, “now is the time for York to show that its commitment to fighting antisemitism includes concrete actions, not just words.</p>
<p>“In our opinion, someone who believes that the vast majority of Canadian Jews subscribe to ‘Jewish supremacy’ and that the Jewish State might ‘plausibly’ have exaggerated the Holocaust is clearly unfit to teach anyone about human rights.”</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Zionism was compared to white supremacy in a university. In May, 2019 a guest speaker at the University of California Los Angeles made a similar comment.</p>
<p>The lecturer was Prof. Rabab Abdulhadi, an associate professor of Ethnic Studies and Race and Resistance Studies at San Francisco State University.</p>
<p>Two students during the lecture reported to the Jewish Journal that Abdulhadi made &ldquo;a claim that those who support Israel want to ethnically cleanse the Middle East and those affiliated with Israel and pro-Israel organizations are white supremacists.&rdquo;

<h3 id="bnai-brith-canada-calls-on-york-university-to-discipline-professor-for-comparing-zionism-to-white-supremacy">&ldquo;B’nai Brith Canada Calls on York University to Discipline Professor for Comparing Zionism to White Supremacy&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://jewishjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1600px-Scott_Library_York_University_Jan_08.jpg" alt="img">
B’nai Brith Canada launched a petition on June 24 calling on York University in Toronto to take action against a professor for equating Zionism with white supremacy.</p>
<p>According to a press release from B’nai Brith Canada, York University Osgoode Hall Law Professor Faisal Bhabha said during a June 10 panel that Zionism is just “Jewish supremacy.” He later doubled down, saying, “I am equating Zionism with white supremacy.” Bhabha also said it was possible that Israel is “exaggerating the Holocaust.”</p>
<p>“The notion that Zionism, which merely calls for Jewish statehood in the Jewish homeland — no different than most other national movements — is a uniquely evil form of ‘supremacy,’ is a false and dangerous allegation,” the petition stated. “Mr. Bhabha’s twisting of Zionism rhetorically transforms hundreds of thousands of Canadian Jews into ‘Jewish supremacists.’ ”</p>
<p>Additionally, Bhabha’s Holocaust comment “is likely to sow hatred and division when no basis for it exists.”</p>
<p>The petition concluded with a call for York University to remove Bhabha from teaching any human rights courses.</p>
<p>“Any version of human rights that does not include a firm rejection of anti-Semitism is ethically and morally bankrupt,” the petition stated. “Students at York University and Osgoode Hall Law School deserve better.”</p>
<p>B’nai Brith Canada CEO Michael Mostyn said in a statement, “Now is the time for York to show that its commitment to fighting anti-Semitism includes concrete actions, not just words. In our opinion, someone who believes that the vast majority of Canadian Jews subscribe to ‘Jewish supremacy’ and that the Jewish State might ‘plausibly’ have exaggerated the Holocaust is clearly unfit to teach anyone about human rights.”</p>
<p>The university did not respond to the Journal’s request for comment.</p>
<p>On June 2, York University President and Vice Chancellor Rhonda Lenton announced that the university would be taking measures to address anti-Semitism on campus after violence broke out during protests against a pro-Israel speaking event in November. The measures included adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism and making it clear when protests stop being peaceful.</p>
<p>“York is not immune from anti-Semitism, nor are we unique in grappling with its manifestations within our community,” Lenton said. “The University has been clear: we condemn anti-Semitism in all its forms, just as we condemn Islamophobia, anti-Black racism, anti-Asian racism, anti-Indigenous racism, and any discrimination and hate based on national origin, race, religion, creed, ability, gender, or sexual orientation.”</p>
<p>She added: “We cannot police the beliefs of our community members, but we can strengthen our policies and procedures to protect our community from abhorrent views and actions. We also have an important role to play in addressing discrimination through research and education.”</p>
<p>UPDATE: York University chief spokesperson Barbara Joy said in a statement to the Journal on June 26, “We deeply value and encourage a diversity of opinion and thought in our university community while recognizing that free speech has limits. The right to free expression does not extend to words and deeds that incite hatred or violence and we have zero tolerance for hate or racism.”</p>
<p>She added: “ At the same time, York considers the privilege afforded by academic freedom as vitally important to robust and respectful dialogue – perhaps especially on topics where there is strong disagreement. Universities play a central role in creating a place where difficult world issues can be discussed and where people hopefully learn from each other and work towards solutions. The University expects all community members to actively engage in our shared responsibility to uphold and promote the values of respect, equity, diversity and inclusion across our campuses. “

<h3 id="outspoken-iraqis-fear-rogue-groups-after-analyst-killed">&ldquo;Outspoken Iraqis fear rogue groups after analyst killed&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1592509692" alt="img">
BAGHDAD — The killing of a prominent security analyst who had received threats from Iran-backed militias has struck fear in the hearts of outspoken Iraqis concerned that they, too, could be targeted by armed groups.</p>
<p>The death of Hisham al-Hashimi also highlighted the limits of Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi&rsquo;s power to reign in armed groups acting outside the state&rsquo;s authority, experts and Iraqi officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Iraqi mourners and relatives of al-Hashimi carried his body in a funeral procession hours after he was gunned down Monday night outside his home in Baghdad&rsquo;s Zeyouneh neighborhood. His casket, draped in the Iraqi flag, was taken to his family home before being driven to the burial site in the holy city of Najaf.</p>
<p>Al-Hashimi, a leading expert on the Islamic State group and other militant organizations, was a regular fixture on Iraqi television and his expertise was often sought by government officials, journalists and researchers.</p>
<p>No one immediately claimed responsibility for the killing, which comes weeks after he confided to close friends that he had received threats from militia groups. The slaying also coincides with a spate of rocket attacks targeting U.S. interests that has been blamed on Iran-backed armed groups.</p>
<p>Al-Kadhimi vowed to pursue al-Hashimi&rsquo;s killers, saying &ldquo;Iraq would not sleep&rdquo; until they were brought to justice, during his weekly Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But critical voices in Iraq, especially those supporting anti-government protests and people outspoken against militia groups, are contemplating changing their online presence in the aftermath of al-Hashimi&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Mariam, 26, an activist who participated in anti-government protests in Baghdad&rsquo;s Tahrir Square that erupted in October, said she has stopped posting on social media for the time being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has shocked us is that they killed someone with Hisham&rsquo;s connections and influence. Activists across Iraq have been killed with impunity for years, and especially during the protests,&rdquo; Mariam said, asking that her last name not be used for fear of retribution. &ldquo;With his death we are in disbelief, and we are being careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al-Hashimi&rsquo;s assassination was a message meant to silence critics, said Ruba Ali al-Hassani, an academic researcher at York University&rsquo;s Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Analysts are being targeted not because of who they are but because of what they represent and what their voices represent,&rdquo; she said. Al-Hassani co-manages the Iraqi Network for Social Media, a network of bloggers that tracks social media at the height of the Iraq protests.</p>
<p>Al-Hassani said Iraqi activists in Baghdad and the country&rsquo;s south, where mass protests were held in October, are being more careful with their online presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are saying, we have to watch our words now, we can&rsquo;t say everything online,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Al-Hashimi had received threats from Islamic State group militants. But close friends said he had been growing concerned about threats coming from Iran-aligned groups after being a vocal proponent of the protest movement in October. At the time, top leaders of the Popular Mobilization Forces said they could not help him ward off the threats. The PMF is a state umbrella group comprised of an array of militia groups, including Iran-backed ones.</p>
<p>This prompted al-Hashimi to relocate to Turkey temporarily with his family late last year. He returned in January, and as threats abated, he resumed making frequent media appearances in which he openly critcized militia groups.</p>
<p>Then, the menacing messages returned right as a government-imposed lockdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic shut down international airports.</p>
<p>During that time, close friends said, al-Hashimi never considered his life was in danger. &ldquo;He thought they just wanted to silence him,&rdquo; said Iraqi analyst Sajad Jiyad, a close friend.</p>
<p>Authorities launched a raid last week in Baghdad, in which they detained 14 members of the powerful Kataib Hezbollah group, suspected of orchestrating the attacks targeting U.S. interests. All but one of the detainees were released days later in what was widely seen as a capitulation by the government.</p>
<p>Whether his government can bring al-Hashimi&rsquo;s killers to court will be a &ldquo;big test for al-Kadhimi&rsquo;s credibility,&rdquo; said Iraq analyst Fanar Haddad.</p>
<p>Hours after al-Hashimi&rsquo;s killing, authorities fired the top police officer for Zeyouneh and launched an investigation into his activities, according to an order from the prime minister&rsquo;s office, seen by The Associated Press.

<h3 id="mother-of-newborn-twins-denied-exemption-to-return-to-home-province-of-nl">&ldquo;Mother of newborn twins denied exemption to return to home province of N.L.&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5633211.1593544040!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/heidi-matthews.jpeg" alt="img">
Heidi Matthews tried to come to her home province of Newfoundland and Labrador with her newborn twins but was denied a travel exemption. (Submitted by Heidi Matthews)</p>
<p>A law professor who recently became a mother to newborn twins has been denied entry to return to her home province of Newfoundland and Labrador to get help with child care.</p>
<p>Heidi Matthews, a law professor at Osgoode Hall in Toronto, says she was denied the right to come home and introduce her newborn twins to family members. The planned trip was for some child care help, not simply a short vacation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re living in a time where at home in Toronto now we&rsquo;re not comfortable and we&rsquo;re not able to invite other people into the home to help us out with our caregiving responsibilities during very crucial first weeks and months of children&rsquo;s lives,&rdquo; she told CBC News on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would … come home certainly for a slightly more extended period of time than a one-week visit. Several weeks at a minimum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matthews applied for exemption on June 23. Less than three days later it was rejected, she said, without an explanation.</p>
<p>As a legal scholar with a focus on human rights related to emergencies, Matthews said, she has several questions raised about the travel ban itself.</p>
<p>She isn&rsquo;t alone.</p>
<p>The provincial government is currently facing a class-action suit prepared by lawyers Geoff Budden and Bob Buckingham on behalf of some seasonal residents who have owned property in the province since 2008, while also facing a charter challenge filled against its travel restriction Bill 38.</p>
<p>Matthews said she may join one of the suits already tabled but may have a court review her own case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think legal action is an important part in forcing government to be responsive to its legal obligations here,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>In denying our request, the Chief Medical Officer of Health provided no reasons, despite inviting me to appeal its &ldquo;decision.&rdquo; This is likely a violation of the administrative law duty to give reasons, esp b/c s6 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#Charter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> mobility rights are implicated. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#nlpoli<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->#cdnpoli<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@GovNL<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->https://t.co/sF2HnyVfl7<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->pic.twitter.com/KjmlMcjg1J<!-- raw HTML omitted --> —@Heidi__Matthews</p>
<p>Exemption list</p>
<p>The provincial government&rsquo;s travel exemption form can be filled out online. A section lists reasons why a travel exemption is needed, including personal or family medical reasons, and supporting a family member in need of care.</p>
<p>Matthews said there&rsquo;s an arbitrary distinction between the kinds of care giving that the provincial government is valuing in the process.</p>
<p>Matthews and David Slavick are new parents. (Submitted by Heidi Matthews)</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no substantive reason to take seriously the needs of family members who need care because they&rsquo;re critically ill, and the needs of family members who need care, for example because they have, which happens to be in my case, two new additions to the family,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Newfoundland and Labrador will join an &ldquo;Atlantic bubble&rdquo; beginning Friday, which allows residents from the four Atlantic Canadian provinces to move throughout the region without a required 14-day self-isolation period upon entering a new province. Premier Dwight Ball said Wednesday the province could also open to the rest of Canada on July 17.</p>
<p>Asked Tuesday about Matthews&rsquo; denied exemption, Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Janice Fitzgerald said she couldn&rsquo;t speak to every decision that&rsquo;s made but noted Matthews could appeal the decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If someone feels that they need to have a reconsideration or they wish to appeal, they feel that they&rsquo;ve been wrongly denied, then they certainly have the opportunity to do that.&rdquo;</p>
