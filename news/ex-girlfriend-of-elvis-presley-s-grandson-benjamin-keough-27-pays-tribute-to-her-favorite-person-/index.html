<p>The ex-girlfriend of Elvis Presley&rsquo;s grandson Benjamin Keough paid tribute to her &lsquo;favorite person&rsquo; Monday after he shot himself dead in the early hours of Sunday.</p>
<p>Alexa Rohde shared a number of pictures of the 27-year-old to her Instagram account, writing: &lsquo;You were my favorite person from the moment I met you. I wish we could’ve kept you forever Ben Ben.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Sheriff&rsquo;s Department issued a statement Sunday saying Elvis&rsquo; only grandson had died after suffering &lsquo;one gunshot wound to the upper torso&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Keough&rsquo;s current girlfriend pleaded with him not to shoot himself, later telling police she feared his mother Lisa Marie Presley and the rest of his family would &lsquo;blame her&rsquo; for his death, DailyMail.com earlier revealed.</p>
<p>Diana Pinto was heard screaming &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t do it&rsquo; to Keough in the moments leading up to his death at Presley&rsquo;s $1.8 million luxury Calabasas, California mansion.</p>

<p>Alexa Rohde shared a number of pictures of Keough, pictured together, to Instagram Monday</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were my favorite person from the moment I met you&rsquo;, Rohde wrote</p>
<p>The Sheriff&rsquo;s Department issued a statement Sunday saying Elvis&rsquo; only grandson, pictured with his ex-girlfriend, had died after suffering &lsquo;one gunshot wound to the upper torso&rsquo;</p>
<p>A neighbor exclusively told DailyMail.com they heard the residents of the Presley&rsquo;s $1.8 million property (pictured) partying at 1am, before a woman was heard screaming loudly, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t do it&rsquo;, at 3.30am - although the neighbor didn&rsquo;t hear a gunshot</p>
<p>Keough&rsquo;s ex-girlfriend paid tribute with series of images showing the pair of them together plus pictures of Benjamin out for dinner and in a swimming pool. They are believed to have dated around 2015.</p>
<p>She wrote: &lsquo;Benjamin Storm, YOU. Always happy in the sun and water. And a laugh that made everyone happier. You gave love to anyone who needed it. You were wise like a thousand year old man, but silly as a 5 year old.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You always said your favorite tarot card was the hermit, cause you could relate. You made the best jokes, and always broke the rules. You were my favorite person from the moment I met you. I wish we could’ve kept you forever Ben Ben.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you’re having all the delicious sushi in paradise. Words will never be enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In an image from 2015 Rohde posed with Benjamin&rsquo;s mom Lisa Marie, writing: &lsquo;When your boyfriends mom is epically gorgeous.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The former couple are believed to have dated around 2015. Neighbors said people were partying at the home where Keough died at 1am and heard screams around 3.30am</p>
<p>Neighbors noted police showed up to the home hours later around 6am</p>
<p>Benjamin&rsquo;s mother, Lisa Marie, is understood to have not been in the house at the time of the shooting and neighbors said they had not seen her at the property for several weeks</p>
<p>The Presley family began gathering at the house later on Sunday, after news of the shocking reported suicide emerged. Benjamin Keough is pictured with his ex-girlfriend</p>

<p>Pinto was interviewed by police, with the neighbor explaining: &lsquo;She was pretty hysterical saying &lsquo;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it.&rsquo;&rsquo; She just kept swearing and saying, &lsquo;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it&hellip; I can&rsquo;t believe he would do that to himself.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She said, &lsquo;&lsquo;the family&rsquo;s going to hate me&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&lsquo;they&rsquo;re going to blame me.&rsquo;&rsquo; I think she was feeling guilty for it happening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is the girlfriend of Benjamin Keough, who pleaded with him not to shoot himself, later telling police she feared his mother Lisa Marie Presley and the rest of his family would &lsquo;blame her&rsquo; for his death, DailyMail.com can reveal</p>
<p>Diana Pinto was heard screaming &lsquo;don&rsquo;t do it&rsquo; to Keough in the moments leading up to the 27-year-old shooting himself in the torso at Presley&rsquo;s $1.8 million luxury Calabasas, California mansion</p>
<p>The resident said Benjamin&rsquo;s mother, Lisa Marie (pictured together in 2012), was not in the house at the time of the shooting and they had not seen her at the property for several weeks</p>
<p>DailyMail.com has identified the girlfriend as Pinto, who works as a post production coordinator at Fox (Film, TV and Sports), according to her LinkedIn page.</p>
<p>The neighbor said they had seen Pinto coming and going from the home with Benjamin regularly, adding the couple had been dating at least two years.</p>

<p>But other neighbors saw the Presley family gathering at the house later on Sunday, after news of the shocking reported suicide emerged.</p>
<p>Bereaved Lisa Marie&rsquo;s representative told DailyMail.com: &lsquo;She is completely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated but trying to stay strong for her 11-year-old twins and her oldest daughter Riley. She adored that boy. He was the love of her life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Residents of the guard gated Calabasas community – which was cordoned off by police after the shooting on Sunday – said the family kept to themselves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;re very private,&rsquo; a neighbor told DailyMail.com. &lsquo;They go out of their way to turn around and not even wave or anything. Not that they&rsquo;re rude, they just don&rsquo;t want anybody to know who they are.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Another neighbor Alexander Freiberg, 67, who lives across the street from Keough, says the &lsquo;secluded&rsquo; and &lsquo;private&rsquo; community has been left &lsquo;shocked&rsquo; by the death.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What happened is a tragedy and it took everybody by surprise. Everybody is shocked, may his soul rest in peace,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Homicide Bureau detectives are continuing their death investigation of a male white adult in his 20s, who was discovered [at] Alexandra Court, Calabasas, on Sunday, July 12, 2020 at approximately 6:30 a.m,&rsquo; the sheriff&rsquo;s department said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Detectives have learned that deputies assigned to Malibu/Lost Hills Sheriff&rsquo;s Station responded to the location regarding a &lsquo;rescue response&rsquo; call.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upon their arrival, they located the victim suffering from one gunshot wound to the upper torso. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene.&rsquo;</p>
<p>An official could be seen outside the mansion on Sunday while police and a coroner&rsquo;s vehicle were parked nearby.</p>
<p>Benjamin was the son of musician Danny Keough, who married Lisa Marie in 1988 and divorced her in 1994.</p>
<p>His mother, who has three other children, had previously spoken of her son&rsquo;s similarity to her dad Elvis, calling their resemblance &lsquo;uncanny&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Benjamin Keough&rsquo;s former stepfather Michael Lockwood pictured with his fiance Stephanie Hobgood in Calabasas on Sunday</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ben does look so much like Elvis,&rsquo; Lisa Marie said in a 2012 interview with CMT. &lsquo;Everybody was grabbing him for a photo because it is just uncanny. Sometimes I am overwhelmed when I look at him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Elvis&rsquo; daughter went on to marry Michael Jackson, Nicholas Cage and finally in 2006 music producer Michael Lockwood, with whom she had twin girls.</p>
<p>Benjamin grew up with his mother and Lockwood in Calabasas.</p>
<p>His mother&rsquo;s latest marriage ended in an acrimonious divorce. She filed for the split in 2016.</p>
<p>Neighbors said the couple now share custody of the twin girls, 11-year-old Finley and Harper Lockwood.</p>
<p>Benjamin&rsquo;s sister, actress and model Riley Keough, has embraced the limelight from her famous family, starring in Magic Mike, Mad Max: Fury Road, and Starz TV show The Girlfriend Experience. But little was publicly known about her more reclusive brother.</p>
<p>Riley, 31, told UK newspaper The Guardian that she and Benjamin had a mixed upbringing, split between their mother&rsquo;s lavish and star-studded lifestyle and their father&rsquo;s modest living.</p>
<p>The resident said Benjamin&rsquo;s mother, Lisa Marie, was not in the house at the time of the shooting and they had not seen her at the property for several weeks. He is pictured in 2017</p>
<p>Lisa Marie, second from left, is pictured with her four children; twins Finley and Harper, front left and right, and Benjamin, back right, and his sister Riley, center</p>
<p>&lsquo;I grew up very privileged with my mother, but my dad didn&rsquo;t live like that. And I think experiencing both sides has been helpful,&rsquo; Riley said in the 2017 interview. &lsquo;My father had mattresses on the floor of his apartments. He lived in cabins and trailer parks. He just didn&rsquo;t have much money.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I was like eight I told him, &lsquo;&lsquo;I want to grow up and be poor like you!&rsquo;&rsquo; He was eating a bowl of cereal. I didn&rsquo;t realize how wildly offensive that was!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 2009 rumors swirled that her brother had signed a $5 million record deal with Universal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The music will be nothing like Elvis, nothing like him at all,&rsquo; he had said in an interview at the time.</p>
<p>But Peter LoFrumento, Executive Vice President of Universal Music Group, later told People: &lsquo;This story is totally untrue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Benjamin&rsquo;s grandmother Priscilla, 75, married Elvis in 1967 but they divorced six years later. They had only daughter Lisa Marie in 1968. Elvis died just nine years later in 1977 at just 42.</p>
<p>In June last year Lisa Marie opened up about her struggles with &lsquo;opioids and painkillers&rsquo; in an essay penned for the forward of the book The United States of Opioids: A Prescription for Liberating a Nation in Pain by Harry Nelson.</p>
<p>She warned of the dangers of prescription drugs as she explained how easily her addiction began after being prescribed painkillers following the birth of her twin daughters in 2008.

<p>Elvis Presley&rsquo;s only grandson died on Sunday, his mother Lisa Marie Presley&rsquo;s manager has confirmed.</p>
<p>Benjamin Keough was 27, but manager Roger Widynowski gave no further details about his death.</p>
<p>He said Lisa Marie, 52, was &ldquo;heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She adored that boy. He was the love of her life,&rdquo; Widynowski said, adding that she was &ldquo;trying to stay strong&rdquo; for her three daughters.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles County coroner&rsquo;s office confirmed that the death of a person of his name and age was under investigation, but there was no other immediate information on the circumstances.</p>
<p>He was the younger of the two children Lisa Marie Presley had with her first husband, musician Danny Keough, before their divorce in 1994. The other is actress Riley Keough, 31.</p>
<p>Lisa Marie had previously described Keough&rsquo;s resemblance to her famous father as &ldquo;just uncanny.&rdquo; Rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll legend Elvis Presley died in 1977 aged 42.</p>
<p>Lisa Marie also has twin 11-year-old daughters with her fourth husband, musician and producer Michael Lockwood, who she wed in 2006 after brief marriages to pop star Michael Jackson and actor Nicolas Cage.</p>
<p>Her close relationship with her son, whose middle name was Storm, apparently inspired the title track on her third album, Storm &amp; Grace, released in 2012.</p>

<h3 id="benjamin-keough-lisa-marie-presleys-adored-son-had-been-struggling-before-death">&ldquo;Benjamin Keough, Lisa Marie Presley’s adored son, had ‘been struggling’ before death&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Obit_Benjamin_Keough_08286.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=694" alt="img">
Lisa Marie Presley has been left “completely heartbroken” and “inconsolable” after the death of her eldest child, Benjamin Keough, 27, in an apparent suicide.</p>
<p>But a source told The Sun that the death of the young man — whom Lisa Marie Presley said bore an “uncanny” resemblance to her legendary father, Elvis Presley — wouldn’t come as “a huge surprise.”</p>
<p>“It is shocking news but it also isn’t a huge surprise as he had been struggling,” the source said. “Everyone is heartbroken and devastated.”</p>
<p>Keough also was no stranger to family turmoil: His legendary grandfather, Elvis Presley, died at age 42, his mother was married four times and was once devoted to the Church of Scientology, and his stepfathers briefly included Michael Jackson and Nicolas Cage.</p>
<p>Keough was found by police with a single gunshot wound to the upper torso at around 6:30 a.m. Sunday at his mother’s mansion in Calabasas, TMZ reported. It’s not known whether Keough was alone at the house.</p>
<p>Lisa Marie Presley’s manager said: “She is completely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated but trying to stay strong for her 11-year-old twins and her oldest daughter Riley. She adored that boy. He was the love of her life.”</p>

<p>Unlike his sister, Riley, who has pursued a successful career as an actress in film and TV, Benjamin Keough has mostly kept out of the spotlight. In 2009, he gave an interview in which he said he had signed a $5 million record deal, but nothing ever came of it, the Hollywood Reporter said.</p>
<p>In 2015, Keough shared a photo of an Elvis Presley outfit he had bought, the Daily Mail reported. He wrote on Instagram: “I purchased a piece of grandad today from a collector. He wore it in 1974. I feel a lot closer to him now.”</p>
<p>If Keough had been “struggling” recently, it’s not entirely clear how, but in his famous show-business family, his grandfather, Elvis Presley, was known for his excesses and dysfunctional personal life, which included his marriage to Keough’s grandmother, Priscilla Presley, whom he began dating when she was just 14 years old.</p>
<p>Elvis Presley’s death in 1977 came after years of reported drug abuse. Lisa Marie Presley, 9 at the time of her father’s death, became the sole heir to Graceland and to the rest of his estate.</p>
<p>While Lisa Marie Presley grew up in her father’s shadow, she eventually won some acclaim for her own musical career, which included three rock albums, but she gained most of her headlines for own troubled personal life.</p>
<p>Presley was married to Michael Jackson from 1994 to 1996, just as the late troubled mega-star was hit by the first wave of child-molestation allegations. For three months in 2002, Presley also was married to mercurial actor Nicolas Cage.</p>
<p>Keough’s father is Lisa Marie Presley’s first husband, musician Danny Keough. Presley and Danny Keough married in 1988 and together they had Riley Keough in 1989 and Benjamin Keough in 1992. Presley and Danny Keough divorced in 1994, just before she married Michael Jackson, but she has said in interviews over the years that she and Danny Keough have remained close friends and musical collaborators.</p>
<p>At the time of her son’s birth, Presley was a devoted Scientologist. She had been brought into the controversial, cult-like Church of Scientology by her mother, Priscilla Presley, in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>When reporting on Benjamin Keough’s birth in Tampa, Florida, the Associated Press quoted a spokesperson who said the 24-year-old Presley delivered the 7-pound, 8-ounce boy “naturally and in complete silence in a calm and supportive environment” under guidelines set out by Scientology’s founder, L. Ron Hubbard, in his book “Dianetics.”</p>
<p>Presley’s devotion to Scientology extended through the 2000s when she was honored for her work on behalf of a church-backed literary crusade. She also took up the church’s opposition to psychiatry and the use psychotropic drugs for mental health conditions. At a 2002 congressional hearing, Presley testified against the use of psychiatric medications for children diagnosed with ADHD or with other behavioral, mental and emotional problems.</p>
<p>“What I do want to emphasize here today though, is that only by looking for alternatives to drugs will parents discover for themselves the numerous simple, workable and drug-free answers to the problems of attention, behavior and learning,” Presley testified at the Committee on House Government Reform.</p>
<p>But later in the decade, Presley grew discontented with Scientology and finally left the church in 2016, the Underground Bunker site reported. She released a song, “So Long,” in 2012 that decried churches that “don’t have a soul” and “corrupt” religions that run people’s lives.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Underground Bunker reported that Keough was definitely raised in Scientology. A source told the site: “The important thing is that the entire family was shaped by Scientology, and it’s paying the price because of it.”</p>
<p>Keough also had struggled with addiction, recently been to rehab and badmouthed the organization to friends. As recently as May, Keough told friends, according to the Underground Bunker, “how (expletive) up kids get in Scientology.”</p>
<p>Long before Presley reportedly left Scientology and tried to pull her older children out, she married for a fourth time in 2006 to guitarist and music producer Michael Lockwood. They became parents to twin daughters, Harper and Finley, in 2008. But Presley filed for divorce in 2016, and the two became locked in a bitter custody battle.</p>
<p>Throughout her various marital troubles, Presley has stayed close to her only son. In 2009, Presley and Keough got matching tattoos, the Daily Mail reported.</p>
<p>Presley also liked to remark on her son’s resemblance to her father, saying in an interview, according to TMZ: “Ben does look so much like Elvis,” Presley said in an interview. “He was at the Opry and was the quiet storm behind the stage. Everybody turned around and looked when he was over there. Everybody was grabbing him for a photo because it is just uncanny.”</p>
<p>It’s also been said that Presley wrote her 2012 song “Storm and Grace” about her son; Storm is Benjamin’s middle name, The Hollywood Reporter said.</p>
<p>“You have the most beautiful heart that I’ve ever known,” the lyrics go at one point. “It kills me you can’t ever show it/And a shell has been grown/Stop moving so fast there, and then/Take your foot off the gas.”</p>
<p>“You blow me away,” the song continues. “Your storm and your grace/My heart can’t seem to take it/Your storm and your grace.”</p>
<p>This story has been updated to include reporting from The Underground Bunker site, which is run by journalist Tony Ortega.

<p>Authorities did not say who shot him. Deputies who discovered his body early Sunday morning were responding to a &ldquo;rescue response call,&rdquo; the statement said.</p>
<p>TMZ first reported Keough&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>In a statement, a representative for Lisa Marie Presley said she is &ldquo;completely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated but trying to stay strong for her 11-year-old twins and her oldest daughter, Riley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She adored that boy,&rdquo; the representative said. &ldquo;He was the love of her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lisa Marie Presley, 52, is the only child of the legendary singer and actor, who died in 1977 at age 42.</p>
<p>CORRECTION (July 13, 2020, 5:25 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated Lisa Marie Presley&rsquo;s background. She was Elvis Presley&rsquo;s only child but not Priscilla Presley&rsquo;s. Priscilla Presley also has a son.
