<p>Two men stood beside him in the execution chamber, a U.S. Marshal and a spiritual adviser, whom the Bureau of Prisons referred to as an “Appalachian pagan minister.” Neither wore a mask.</p>
<p>“I didn’t do it,” Mr. Lee said, according to a report from journalists who were at the scene. “I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my life, but I’m not a murderer.” He claimed the judge in his trial in Arkansas overlooked DNA evidence that proved he was across the country at the time of the murders.</p>
<p>After a senior bureau official told him that he was to be put to death, Mr. Lee shook his head. As the drug was administered to his veins, he raised his head to look around. Then his breaths became heavy. In just a few short moments, his chest remained still, his lips turned blue, and his fingers became ashy. He was pronounced dead at 8:07 a.m.</p>
<p>The federal government is scheduled to carry out two more executions this week. A court has issued a temporary stay in the case of Wesley Ira Purkey, 68, whom the Justice Department scheduled for execution on Wednesday for the 1998 killing and dismembering of a teenage girl in Kansas City.</p>
<p>Dustin Lee Honken, 52, convicted of killing three adults and two young girls in 1993, will be executed on Friday, barring any last-minute stays. Another prisoner, Keith Dwayne Nelson, 46, will face execution in August for the rape and murder of a 10-year-old girl in 1999.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a federal judge in Indiana dismissed a suit brought by spiritual advisers for Mr. Purkey and Mr. Honken that argued for a delay on the grounds that their health could be jeopardized because of the coronavirus crisis if they entered the Terre Haute penitentiary.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court struck down the death penalty in 1972, arguing that it constituted “cruel and unusual punishment.” Four years later, it reversed that decision, amid rising rates of violent crime. Since then, some states have carried out regular executions, but only three men have been put to death by the federal government. Most recently, Louis Jones Jr. was executed in 2003 for the rape and murder of a female soldier.

(CNN) Daniel Lewis Lee, a convicted killer, was executed Tuesday morning in the first federal execution in 17 years after the Supreme Court issued an overnight ruling that it could proceed.</p>
<p>Lee was pronounced dead by the coroner at 8:07 a.m. ET in Terre Haute, Indiana. His last words were &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it. I&rsquo;ve made a lot of mistakes in my life but I&rsquo;m not a murderer. You&rsquo;re killing an innocent man,&rdquo; according to a pool report.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court cleared the way for the resumption of the federal death penalty in an unsigned order released after 2 a.m. ET Tuesday.</p>
<p>The court wiped away a lower court order temporarily blocking the execution of Lee in a 5-4 vote.</p>
<p>Lee, a one-time white supremacist who killed a family of three, was scheduled to be executed Monday. A federal judge blocked the planned execution of Lee, and three others, citing ongoing challenges to the federal government&rsquo;s lethal injection protocol.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JJQOTEGFZYI6VAUV3BBEQM4KPM.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
“I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my life, but I’m not a murderer,” Lee said when asked if he wanted to make a final statement, according to the pool report. His final words were: “You’re killing an innocent man.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Although the death penalty has been in decline nationwide for years, with executions and death sentences down significantly, the Justice Department has publicly pushed against that trend for nearly a year. The department has argued in court and in public statements that it needed to carry out lawful sentences, citing the gravity of the crimes involved.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Last year, the department laid out a new lethal injection protocol — using one drug, pentobarbital — and said it would begin carrying out executions, leading to extended legal challenges. Attorney General William P. Barr had said recently that officials “owe it to the victims of these horrific crimes, and to the families left behind.”</p>
<p>Lee had challenged his execution on his own and along with other death-row inmates. His execution was also opposed by some relatives of his victims, who argued against his death sentence in the case and sought to stop his lethal injection from taking place amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>On Monday, Lee’s lethal injection — originally scheduled for 4 p.m. that afternoon — was left on hold following a judge’s order that he and other death-row inmates could pursue their court cases arguing that the new lethal-injection protocol is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>An appeals court said late Monday that it would not let the executions take place as planned, but a divided Supreme Court weighed in overnight saying they could proceed.</p>
<p>In an unsigned 5-4 order, the court’s conservative justices said the prisoners on death row had “not made the showing required to justify last-minute intervention.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“It is our responsibility to ensure that method-of-execution challenges to lawfully issued sentences are resolved fairly and expeditiously, so that the question of capital punishment can remain with the people and their representatives, not the courts, to resolve,” said the opinion, which quoted court precedents.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Although the author is unclear, the opinion was the work of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh.</p>
<p>The court’s four liberal justices wrote two dissents. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan, said that the court was “hastily” ending the inmates’ challenges and that as a result, there would “be no meaningful judicial review of the grave, fact-heavy challenges” they brought.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer, joined by Ginsburg, reiterated his view that the court should examine whether the death penalty itself is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Media witnesses at Lee’s execution on Tuesday morning saw him strapped to a gurney and with an IV in his left arm and both arms restrained, according to the pool report. When the lethal drug was being injected, his breathing appeared to become labored, his chest eventually stopped moving and his lips appeared to turn blue.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Ruth Friedman, an attorney for Lee, decried the government’s decision to execute him during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“It is beyond shameful that the government, in the end, carried out this execution in haste, in the middle of the night, while the country was sleeping,” she said in a statement. “We hope that upon awakening, the country will be as outraged as we are.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Barr said that Lee had “finally faced the justice he deserved” on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>“The American people have made the considered choice to permit capital punishment for the most egregious federal crimes, and justice was done today in implementing the sentence for Lee’s horrific offenses,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Even after the Supreme Court’s order, uncertainty still lingered for hours in the case. Friedman said Lee “remained strapped to a gurney” for the four hours leading up to his execution as another legal dispute played out. She said another stay was still in place.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said Lee would have been executed at 4 a.m., but attributed the four-hour delay that followed to his attorneys contesting whether the execution could proceed. Kerri Kupec, a department spokeswoman, called it “a last-minute procedural claim” in a statement.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Lee and another man were convicted of murdering three people, including Nancy Mueller and her 8-year-old daughter, Sarah Powell.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>He and this other man, Chevie Kehoe, were part of a group intending to create a white supremacist community in the Pacific Northwest, and they traveled to Arkansas in 1996, where they robbed and murdered William Mueller, a firearms dealer, along with his wife and the child, court records show. The men placed plastic bags over their heads and threw them into a bayou, the records show.</p>
<p>Relatives of victims in the case had fought against Lee’s execution, asking that it be called off or at least postponed because of the coronavirus, saying they would have to put their lives at risk to witness his death.</p>
<p>Lee’s execution was first scheduled to take place last year before being delayed several months by other court challenges. The victims’ relatives who spoke out said it was unfair Lee was given a death sentence while Kehoe, who officials described as the ringleader in the killings, was sentenced instead to life in prison, a position echoed later by the judge and lead prosecutor from the trial.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>In a court case filed last week, the three relatives — Earlene Peterson, Nancy Mueller’s mother; Kimma Gurel, Mueller’s sister; and Monica Veillette, her niece — had asked that the execution be postponed. Although they did not support the execution, the relatives said, they still felt obligated to attend.</p>
<p>But all three said they have existing health issues, so they faced “grave risk” if they traveled during the pandemic and went to a federal prison. They asked that it be postponed so they did not have to choose between staying home or risking infection.</p>
<p>“No other family should have to make this decision . . . the families of victims should not be put in a position where they have to risk their lives or give up their right” as a witness, Veillette said in an interview. “That is not how we should be treating the families of victims in this country.”</p>
<p>Lee’s execution had been put on hold and then cleared to proceed multiple times in recent days. A federal judge in Indiana last week blocked it from proceeding because of the relatives’ court challenge, while an appeals court panel on Sunday evening said it could take place.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The relatives ultimately decided not to travel to Indiana because they had determined that the health risks were too great. The appeals court’s ruling also came too late for them to travel as planned, they said.</p>
<p>Then on Monday morning, a federal judge blocked the government from executing Lee or two other men scheduled to face lethal injections this week. Wesley Purkey, who was convicted in 2003 of raping and murdering Jennifer Long, a teenage girl, and Dustin Lee Honken, who was convicted in 2004 of killing five people, including two young girls.</p>
<p>Purkey’s execution is scheduled for Wednesday, although another court has temporarily stayed it on other grounds, while Honken’s is scheduled for Friday. The Justice Department is also asking the Supreme Court to let Purkey’s execution proceed, but the court has not ruled on that yet.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>In a separate case, spiritual advisers for Purkey and Honken are seeking to have their executions delayed and arguing that they face health risks if they minister during the pandemic. A federal judge in Indiana denied that request Tuesday; they quickly moved to appeal.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan of the District of Columbia wrote in an order Monday that she was blocking all of their executions, and another set for August, because it was necessary to let the inmates’ legal challenges to the government’s lethal-injection protocol play out in court. They had argued that lethal injection is unconstitutional, saying it amounts to cruel and unusual punishment.</p>
<p>The Justice Department quickly appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court. Late Monday night, hours after Lee’s execution was originally scheduled, the D.C. Circuit appeals court declined to let the lethal injections proceed and said the inmates’ challenges could move forward.</p>
<p>In its early morning orders on Tuesday, the Supreme Court also rejected a case brought to them by the relatives of victims in Lee’s case, seeking to have his execution postponed because of their coronavirus-related fears. The court denied that without comment.</p>
<p>“It just became very painfully clear to us that as many times as it was said this was being done for the families of the victims &hellip; that in the end nobody cared about us at all,” Veillette said in an interview after the execution.</p>
<p>She called the Supreme Court’s early morning orders disappointing but not surprising. Veillette said she was up all night monitoring the news from her home in Washington state and in regular touch with her mother, at her own home in the same state, and her grandmother in Arkansas. Early Tuesday morning, Veillette said, her attorney told her Lee had been executed.</p>
<p>“We will never get peace from this,” Veillette said, describing herself as deeply sad and angry at the outcome. “Because justice was not served &hellip; This was done in Nancy and Sarah’s name. And that is the final part of their story now.”

<p>US murderer Daniel Lewis Lee has been put to death, hours after the Supreme Court allowed the first executions of federal inmates in 17 years.</p>
<p>Several executions were initially delayed when a judge ruled on Monday that there were still unresolved legal challenges.</p>
<p>The condemned prisoners had argued that lethal injections constitute &ldquo;cruel and unusual punishments&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But the Supreme Court voted 5-4 that &ldquo;executions may proceed as planned&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Last year, the Trump administration said it would resume federal executions.</p>
<p>Lee was executed by lethal injection in Terre Haute, Indiana, early on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Some relatives of his victims had opposed the execution and sought to have it delayed, arguing that attending it could expose them to coronavirus.</p>
<p>Earlene Peterson, 81, whose daughter, granddaughter and son-in-law were killed by Lee, said she wanted the 47-year-old to be given life in jail, the same sentence as his accomplice.</p>
<p>Who was Daniel Lewis Lee?</p>
<p>Lee was convicted of torturing and killing a family of three in Arkansas in 1996, dumping their bodies in a lake.</p>
<p>Postponed from December, his execution had been rescheduled for 16:00 (20:00 GMT) on 13 July, but was blocked by a ruling from District Judge Tanya Chutkan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The court&hellip; finds that the likely harm that plaintiffs would suffer if the court does not grant injunctive relief far outweighs any potential harm to defendants,&rdquo; the judge said.</p>
<p>Her ruling was consequently overruled by the Supreme Court, which said: &ldquo;The plaintiffs in this case have not made the showing required to justify last-minute intervention by a Federal Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Federal and state executions - what&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>Under the US justice system, crimes can be tried either in federal courts - at a national level - or in state courts, at a regional level.</p>
<p>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The women who write to death row inmates</p>
<p>Certain crimes, such as counterfeiting currency or mail theft, are automatically tried at a federal level, as are cases in which the US is a party or those which involve constitutional violations. Others can be tried in federal courts based on the severity of the crimes.</p>
<p>The death penalty was outlawed at state and federal level by a 1972 Supreme Court decision that cancelled all existing death penalty statutes.</p>
<p>A 1976 Supreme Court decision allowed states to reinstate the death penalty and in 1988 the government passed legislation that made it available again at federal level.</p>
<p>According to data collected by the Death Penalty Information Center, 78 people were sentenced to death in federal cases between 1988 and 2018 but only three were executed. There are 62 inmates currently on federal death row.</p>
<p>Future executions</p>
<p>The previous inmate executed by federal death penalty was Louis Jones Jr, a 53-year-old Gulf War veteran who murdered 19-year-old soldier Tracie Joy McBride.</p>
<p>Three more federal executions are scheduled in the near future. All three prisoners are, like Lee, child killers:</p>
<p>Wesley Ira Purkey, who was sentenced in Missouri in 2003 for the rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl whose body he dismembered, burnt and dumped in a septic pond, is due to be executed on Wednesday</p>
<p>Dustin Lee Honken, sentenced in Iowa in 2004 for shooting dead five people including two girls aged six and 10, is due to be executed on Friday</p>
<p>Keith Dwayne Nelson, sentenced in Missouri in 2001 for the rape and murder of a 10-year-old girl behind a church, is set to be executed next month</p>
<p>The execution of Lee - and the four others that were delayed - were all set to use an injection containing the drug pentobarbital.</p>
<p>The inmates have argued the drug violates their constitutional right not to have &ldquo;cruel and unusual punishments inflicted&rdquo;, because it has allegedly caused additional medical problems in previous uses.</p>
<p>A lawyer for one of the four federal death-row inmates said in a statement on Monday: &ldquo;The government has been trying to plough forward with these executions despite many unanswered questions about the legality of its new execution protocol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why the change in rules on executions?</p>
<p>The Trump administration said it would resume federal executions after a long hiatus last year.</p>
<p>In a statement at the time, Attorney General William Barr said: &ldquo;Under administrations of both parties, the Department of Justice has sought the death penalty against the worst criminals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Justice Department upholds the rule of law - and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.&rdquo;

Update, 8:28 a.m.: Daniel Lewis Lee was executed Tuesday morning. He was pronounced dead at 8:07 a.m.</p>
<p>Update, 12:05 a.m.: A panel of judges with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has denied the Department of Justice&rsquo;s motion to stay an injunction that halted federal executions scheduled to take place in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The injunction, which was issued by a district judge Monday, came only hours before the scheduled execution of Daniel Lewis Lee at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute.</p>
<p>The order halts Lee&rsquo;s execution — which would be the first federal execution in 17 years — and three others that were scheduled to take place in the Terre Haute facility in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Lee, his victims&rsquo; family members and the DOJ petitioned the United States Supreme Court to delay Monday&rsquo;s execution for varying reasons. As of late Monday night, SCOTUS had not responded to those filings.</p>
<p>Original story: Judge delays executions hours before Daniel Lewis Lee is set to die by lethal injection</p>
<p>It will be up to the Supreme Court of the United States to decide whether the execution of a man held at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute will go forward.</p>
<p>Daniel Lewis Lee, a member of a white supremacist group, murdered a family of three, including an 8-year-old girl, in January 1996 in Arkansas. After robbing and shooting the victims with a stun gun, Lee covered their heads with plastic bags, sealed the bags with duct tape, weighed down each victim with rocks, and threw the family of three into the Illinois Bayou in Arkansas.</p>
<p>Lee was convicted of murder in aid of racketeering three years later and was sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Lee&rsquo;s death by lethal injection — which would have been the first federal execution in 17 years — was to take place at 4 p.m. Monday. However, due to a series of judicial interventions, resulting in multiple petitions to the Supreme Court, he remained on death row Friday evening.</p>
<p>Court interventions leave inmates, families in limbo</p>
<p>The district court injunction that halted Lee’s execution has paused all scheduled federal executions, including three others that were expected to take place at the Terre Haute facility within the coming weeks.</p>
<p>On late Friday afternoon, a district court ruled in favor of victims&rsquo; family members, who petitioned for an injunction to pause the execution because traveling to attend would put them at higher risk of contracting the novel coronavirus. An appeals court reversed that decision on Sunday.</p>
<p>By Monday morning, just hours before the Lee’s execution was scheduled to take place, a district judge had intervened yet again, this time granting a preliminary injunction in a case brought by Lee and a dozen other plaintiffs. In their request for injunction, the plaintiffs argued that the injection violates their Eighth Amendment rights — essentially, that the drug’s effects constitute cruel and unusual punishment. They also proposed alternatives they said would reduce the risk of pain.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Prisons uses a single drug, pentobarbital, in executions. The inmates&rsquo; attorneys argued the drug is likely to cause extreme pain, as it induces flash pulmonary edema, producing a drowning sensation. Eyewitness accounts of these executions also describe these prisoners gasping for air and autopsy reports indicate foam or froth in their airways, which indicates the edema fluid mixed with air as the inmate was still attempting to breathe.</p>
<p>They argue that additional safeguards could be taken to reduce the risk of pain, including peripheral IV lines, administering the lethal injection protocol bedside and implementing a contingency plan to respond to &ldquo;unexpected outcomes.&rdquo; They also advocate for a pre-dose of opioids to limit any pain. The Bureau of Prisons has already considered and rejected the use of fentanyl, speculating that drug manufacturers would refuse to supply it for this use.</p>
<p>In their request for injunction, Lee and the other plaintiffs argued that execution by firing squad could be considered an alternative that would &ldquo;significantly reduce the risk of severe pain,&rdquo; pointing to studies that have shown a competent shooting causes near-instant death and firing squads have the lowest rate of &ldquo;botched&rdquo; executions of any method of execution conducted since 1900.</p>
<p>Execution by firing squad is legal in three states, and the last such execution was conducted in June 2010 in Utah.</p>
<p>In her opinion, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan of the District of Columbia wrote that the injunction is in the public interest, because &ldquo;the public is not served by short-circuiting legitimate judicial process, and is greatly served by attempting to ensure that the most serious punishment is imposed in a manner consistent with our Constitution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Chutkan did not offer an opinion as to whether firing squads would be an acceptable alternative in every case, she did note that the prisons bureau could readily accommodate the proposal: &ldquo;the federal government is uniquely capable of consulting with Utah and adopting its existing protocol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the second time Chutkan has ordered an injunction in this case, according to The Hill. The first, last November, found new execution protocols likely violated federal death penalty laws, and was overturned by an appeals court and was not heard by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In response to Monday&rsquo;s injunction, the Department of Justice notified the court of its intent to appeal as well as a motion asking for a stay of the injunction until that appeal could be heard, which would allow for three of the four executions scheduled at the Terre Haute facility to move forward.</p>
<p>In its motion to stay, the DOJ argues the plaintiffs did not propose &ldquo;a known and available alternative method of execution that is feasible and readily implemented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further, the DOJ argues, each of these executions requires the activation of an &ldquo;execution team&rdquo; of about 40 Bureau of Prisons staffers and the mobilization of approximately 100 staffers to provide security and support during the execution. Delaying the execution, they argue, &ldquo;would require significant planning and coordination such as that which already has been undertaken by BOP to date.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is particularly the case now that we are merely hours from Lee’s execution and two more inmates’ executions are only a few days away,&rdquo; they continued. &ldquo;Accordingly, beyond the Government’s strong interest in proceeding with the criminal judgment, operational considerations surrounding the planned executions lend further support in favor of a stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Appealing to the Supreme Court</p>
<p>Some of the victims’ family members, Lee and his counsel and the DOJ asked SCOTUS to intervene Monday — all for different reasons.</p>
<p>The DOJ doubled down on its claims that Lee and the other plaintiffs had not provided reasonable alternatives and chastised the district court for the timing of its order: &ldquo;The district court&rsquo;s last-minute, day-of-execution injunction is inappropriate, contrary to binding precedent from this Court, and should be promptly stayed or summarily vacated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The family has repeatedly argued — and did so in an emergency application to stay sent to the Supreme Court Monday — that traveling to attend the execution would put them at higher risk of contracting the novel coronavirus: “these family members have no interest in asserting their right to attend the execution and seeking to postpone the execution until the resurgence of the COVID-19 virus abates and they can travel safely.”</p>
<p>Shawn Nolan, an attorney representing one of the more than a dozen intervenors or plaintiffs named in the lawsuit, said in a written statement Monday afternoon that the district court’s injunction would allow the courts to address the issues raised regarding the legality of execution protocols.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given that these executions threaten to become COVID-19 super-spreader events,&rdquo; Nolan added, &ldquo;the injunction will also protect the lives and health of the correctional staff, victim family members, spiritual advisors, attorneys, and others who must witness the executions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further, Earlene Peterson, the 81-year-old mother and grandmother of two of Lee&rsquo;s victims, has argued that Lee&rsquo;s co-defendant, Chevie Kehoe, was the ringleader on that fateful day. She said that because the co-defendant was sentenced to life in prison, Lee should receive the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a supporter of President Trump, I pray that he will hear my message: the scheduled execution of Danny Lee for the murder of my daughter and granddaughter is not what I want and would bring my family more pain,&rdquo; Peterson said in a written statement late last month. &ldquo;We don’t want Danny Lee to be executed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee’s attorneys on Monday submitted a petition asking the Supreme Court to review the legality of his sentence.</p>
<p>“The sentencing disparity between Kehoe and Lee, along with serious questions about the evidence presented to the jury both at trial and sentencing and the government’s course of conduct during Lee’s postconviction proceedings, underscores how denying relief to Lee—who faces execution to carry out a sentence of death—risks severe injustice,” the motion states.</p>
<p>As of publication, the stay stands. The Supreme Court has not yet responded to the petitions.</p>
<p>Protesters voice pro- and anti-execution sentiments</p>
<p>As the case volleyed between courts and judges Monday afternoon, protests — both in support of and against the death penalty — took place in the hours before Lee&rsquo;s scheduled execution.</p>
<p>The group of anti-death penalty protesters made their presence known at the busy intersection of U.S. 41 and East Springhill Drive in Terre Haute, about 2 miles from the prison.</p>
<p>About 20 people arrived shortly before 3 p.m. and remained in the southwest corner of the intersection. Some held large banners that read &ldquo;STOP STATE KILLING&rdquo; and &ldquo;LOVE MERCY JUSTICE.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The protesters repeatedly checked their phones for updates on the status of the execution. They were all aware of how rapidly the situation could change and were ready to adjust if needed.</p>
<p>Bill Pelke’s grandmother Ruth Pelke was stabbed to death in northwest Indiana in 1985. Paula Cooper, who was 16 at the time, was sentenced to death for Pelke’s murder. At the time, Cooper was the youngest inmate on death row.</p>
<p>Bill Pelke traveled from Alaska to join the anti-death penalty protest outside of the prison. He said the executions don’t do much for the victims families’ healing process.</p>
<p>“I talk about love and compassion for all humanity. You don’t need to see somebody else die to heal,&rdquo; Pelke said.</p>
<p>Cooper was released in 2013 and later died by suicide.</p>
<p>Abraham Bonowitz, one of the directors of the Terre Haute Death Penalty Resistance and protest organizer, said executions fail as a public policy.</p>
<p>“It’s a moral failure and we’re here to stand for everyone who opposes the death penalty and not tucked away where no one can see us,” he said.</p>
<p>Reaction to the anti-death penalty group from passing drivers was mixed. Some motorists honked their horns and pumped their fists in support. Others yelled insults.</p>
<p>One woman yelled &ldquo;Fry &lsquo;em, fry the bastards!&rdquo; from the passenger seat of a blue sedan. A man driving a red pickup truck waiting at the intersection revved his engine loudly and blanketed the crowd of protesters in thick, black exhaust smoke as he pulled off.</p>
<p>That same pickup driver returned about 15 minutes later to blast the group with exhaust a second time.</p>
<p>Tyler McDuffie, a Brazil resident, demonstrated in favor of the execution. He saw protesters at the corner while on his way to go fishing with a family member.</p>
<p>His decision to demonstrate was a spontaneous one. He pulled into a parking lot across the street and quickly made a sign that read &ldquo;CONTINUE EXECUTION. AN EYE FOR EYE&rdquo; with a marker and a part of a FexEx box.</p>
<p>Other executions scheduled</p>
<p>Three other inmates were scheduled to be executed at the Terre Haute prison in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Wesley Ira Purkey, who raped, murdered and dismembered a 16-year-old girl and was separately convicted of bludgeoning an 80-year-old woman with a claw hammer, is scheduled to be executed Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dustin Lee Honken, who shot and killed five people — including two men who planned to testify against him — is scheduled to be executed Friday.</p>
<p>Keith Dwayne Nelson, who kidnapped, raped and strangled a 10-year-old girl, is scheduled to be executed Aug. 28.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200710181814-daniel-lewis-lee-file-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
Washington (CNN) A federal judge on Monday blocked the planned execution of convicted killer Daniel Lewis Lee, and three others, citing ongoing challenges to the federal government&rsquo;s lethal injection protocol.</p>
<p>Lee is scheduled to be executed Monday, which would be the first federal execution in 17 years.</p>
<p>The injunction from Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington, DC, applies to three other inmates on death row: Wesley Ira Purkey, Dustin Lee Honken and Keith Dwayne Nelson.</p>
<p>The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit late Monday refused the Justice Department&rsquo;s request to stay the injunction. The Justice Department has also appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Three other appeals seeking to delay the execution are also pending at the Supreme Court. One concerns the family of Lee&rsquo;s victims who are concerned about traveling and going to a federal prison during the coronavirus pandemic. A second regards evidence presented by prosecutors during his sentencing hearing.</p>

IN 1996 Chevie Kehoe was convicted of the murder of a Jewish family in Arkansas - a crime that shook the US to its core.</p>
<p>Kehoe and Daniel Lewis Lee were convicted for brutally murdering William Frederick Mueller, his wife Nancy Ann Mueller and his eight-year-old stepdaughter, Sarah Elizabeth Powell.</p>

<p>Who was Daniel Lewis Lee&rsquo;s accomplice Chevie Kehoe?</p>
<p>Chevie O&rsquo;Brien Kehoe is a 47-year-old American white supremacist, terrorist and convicted murderer.</p>
<p>Kehoe was born in Orange County, Florida, on 29 January, 1973.</p>
<p>His upbringing reportedly consisted of extreme anti-government and white supremacist values.</p>
<p>Kehoe formed a plan to bring down the US government with his self-styled &ldquo;Aryan People&rsquo;s Republic&rdquo; militia.</p>
<p>3 Daniel Lewis Lee was sentenced to death for his part in the brutal murders Credit: AP:Associated Press</p>
<p>A year before the murders of William and Nancy Mueller and Sarah Elizabeth, Kehoe burgled their family home in order to steal a large collection of guns, ammunition and money.</p>
<p>In 1996 he and accomplice Daniel Lewis Lee murdered the family of three and deposited their bodies in the Illinois bayou.</p>
<p>Aside from the murder of the Mueller family, Kehoe was accused by his brother Cheyne and a Spokane motel manager of being involved in the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995.</p>
<p>Cheyne claimed to have knowledge of Chevie&rsquo;s involvement in the bombing shortly after he was sentenced for his role in the shootout.</p>
<p>The manager of the Shadow motel in Spokane claimed to have seen Chevie with convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh at the motel around four months before the bombing, which killed 168 people.</p>
<p>3 Kehoe is serving his sentences at the Florence High Penitentiary in Fremont County, Colorado Credit: AP:Associated Press</p>
<p>What happened to him?</p>
<p>On February 20, 1998, Kehoe pleaded guilty to felonious assault, attempted murder, and carrying a concealed weapon.</p>
<p>The charges related to a shootout in Wilmington, Ohio, with an Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper during a traffic stop on February 15, 1997</p>
<p>But in 1999, Kehoe was convicted in federal court of the January 1996 murders of the Mueller family along with Daniel Lewis Lee.</p>
<p>But he escaped the death penalty and was instead sentenced to three sentences of life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>
<p>Kehoe is currently serving his sentence at the Florence High Penitentiary in Fremont County, Colorado.</p>

<p>Lee received the death penalty for his part in the murder and was set to be killed by lethal injection on Monday, July 13, 2020 - the first federal execution to take place in the US in 17 years.</p>
<p>However, just hours before the execution US District Judge Tanya Chutkan delayed the sentence over legal issues.</p>
<p>She said “the public is not served by short-circuiting legitimate judicial process”.</p>
<p>On July 14, Lee was put to death by illegal injection.</p>
<p>His late words were: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it. I&rsquo;ve made a lot of mistakes in my life, but I&rsquo;m not a murderer. &hellip; You&rsquo;re killing an innocent man.&rdquo;
