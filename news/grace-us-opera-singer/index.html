<p>As an opera singer and teacher, Sarah Cullins said when the coronavirus pandemic hit Vermont, it became clear that it might be a while before she and her students could perform in their regularly-scheduled shows and concerts.</p>
<p>Opera is typically performed indoors, in large, densely-packed spaces. Cullins said in the new world of Covid-19, it seemed like her line of work was a kind of a perfect storm for the virus’ spread. Performing arts venues were among the first sectors to be closed, and they may be among the last to come back when things return to normal.</p>
<p>But a few weeks after much of the state grinded to a halt, she realized the performance season might not have to end after all — it would just have to adapt. And if they did things right, it could solve two problems instead of one.</p>
<p>The Bright Side is VTDigger’s series on Vermonters doing good during the coronavirus crisis. If we should know about someone in your community who’s stepping up, email [email protected] with the subject line “The Bright Side.”</p>
<p>Get all of VTDigger&rsquo;s daily news. You&rsquo;ll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox.</p>
<p>Cullins had been thinking about how she could give back to opera’s target audience — older Vermonters. The elderly were also the hardest hit by the virus, often unable to leave their nursing homes to visit friends and family.</p>
<p>Since those people could no longer go to the opera, Cullins decided she should bring the opera to them.</p>
<p>For the last several weeks, in a series they call Project Serenade, Cullins and her students have been travelling to nursing homes across the state, putting on outdoor, socially-distant performances for any facility that’s interested.</p>
<p>“I wanted to give [students] an opportunity to sing and also find some kind of service project we could all do to make some kind of a difference during the pandemic,” she said.</p>
<p>Cullins directs the Youth Opera Workshop of Vermont, a satellite program of the Middlebury Community Music Center. Cullins said the idea for the workshop came from her own Vermont high school experience. She had to choose between using her classical training in the chorus, or doing dramatic work in the musical theater department. With the opera workshop, she could let her students do both.</p>
<p>“I started this to give students the kind of experience I would have wanted in high school, which was a place to use my classical training, but in a dramatic setting,” Cullins said. “I knew there weren’t maybe a lot of kids doing strictly classical training, but enough to make a small little opera program.”</p>
<p>VTDigger is underwritten by:</p>
<p>This was supposed to be the third semester of the program.</p>
<p>“I was trying to figure out a way to keep everyone singing, because it wasn’t just that our performances were cancelled — their high school musicals were cancelled, their choral concerts were cancelled, their chorus festivals were cancelled,” Cullins said.</p>
<p>Cullins said when she first floated the idea of Project Serenade to her students, there was a lot of interest. But it was hard to turn that into action, since so many of her students had gone months without singing or performing.</p>
<p>“It’s been really rough,” Cullins said. “Teenagers have lots of emotions and hormones, and this is a really hard thing to deal with, especially the seniors who are missing prom and graduation and don’t know if they’re actually going to get to college in the fall. A lot of them have had a hard time even getting up energy and will to sing at all.”</p>
<p>She said Project Serenade has made a big difference in turning students’ attitudes around.</p>
<p>“I said, I promise this is going to make you happy, and it’s going to make a difference in the lives of other people, and that’s going to make you feel useful, and it’s going to change things around. Now everyone’s on board,” Cullins said.</p>
<p>In early June, at one of Project Serenade’s performances, 50-plus residents of Pines Senior Living Community gathered in the facility’s backyard, sitting in lawn chairs, wearing sun hats, and eating ice cream sandwiches as Cullins and one of her students put on a half-hour long show of opera songs and musical theater pieces.</p>
<p>Cullins said this performance was the closest she’s ever been to the residents. At some facilities, she said their only interaction with their audience is bravos shouted down from windows.</p>
<p>Grace Lane, a 16-year-old student, said the setup is very different than what she’s used to — no pianist, no indoor acoustics, and no rehearsal time before the performance. But she said getting to perform live is worth the inconveniences.</p>
<p>“I’m so excited to be at these nursing homes because I want to share music with people who aren’t necessarily getting music,” Lane said. “Music will always be a part of my life, but that’s not the way it is for everybody else, so I really want to share that.”</p>
<p>“It was wonderful,” said Pines resident Olga Laird. “I thought both of them were great. The young one, of course, has just started not too long ago, but boy she had it right on. I enjoyed it very much, I was so glad they could come.”</p>
<p>Laird said during the pandemic, her only real excursion has been daily walks. Otherwise, she said, she’s been pretty cooped up, so having something like this to switch up her schedule is “just marvelous.”</p>
<p>Cullins said that’s exactly the point of the project. She said since this is pretty much the only way music is happening this summer, they’ll keep at it as long as they can — and as long as they keep getting requests.</p>
<p>“We’re just trying to bring a little bit of hope, joy and music to the people who, honestly, would normally be our audience,” Cullins said. “It’s important to get to them, because they obviously can’t come to us.”</p>

<h3 id="during-a-dark-time-the-arts-have-provided-light">&ldquo;During a dark time, the arts have provided light&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/06/15/PROC/5804dca5-a8ba-4d85-b29f-4626442f81a0-School_43_art_1.png?crop=1005,566,x0,y4&amp;width=1005&amp;height=566&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
Jim Memmott</p>
<p>Science may get us out of the pandemic, especially when a vaccine arrives, but, in many ways, the arts got us through.</p>
<p>I make this point in part because it worries me that when school administrators and government officials try to get their battered budgets back in line they may first decide that the arts are expendable, that science and math are more useful.</p>
<p>But it turned out that during the last few months the arts were extraordinarily useful, they were right there all the time, giving us comfort, inspiration and hope.</p>
<p>Music certainly rang out. I wrote earlier about John Thompson, the bagpiper who played “Amazing Grace” every night in his Perinton neighborhood. Not far away, Andrew Surrena, an opera singer, gave a daily serenade.</p>
<p>The internet was filled with other performances. One of most uplifting was the project launched by the folk singer Janis Ian. Musicians from around the world, including Rochester’s Steve Gadd, gave their take on her song “Better Times Will Come.” Gadd also talks about his drum corps days in Rochester. It’s fascinating; see it at <a href="https://bit.ly/37yoZTG">https://bit.ly/37yoZTG</a>.</p>
<p>Visual art has been everywhere, too. When schools went online, Susan Houghton, an art teacher at School 43 in Rochester used Twitter (@ROCArts43) and Facebook to post pictures her students had created. The art has a special poignancy, as School 43 will be permanently closed in a few days.</p>
<p>“I began with the thought that our students might feel isolated and confused, and miss the school, teachers, friends, etc., through this pandemic,” Houghton wrote in an email. “And the art was a way I could help connect them.”</p>
<p>The Rochester’s Memorial Art Gallery has just finished up its 30-Day Sketchbook Challenge in which artists, isolated at home, were invited to submit art prompted by phrases, my favorite being “that song your great uncle sang.” The challenge finished on June 13, and some submissions are already posted online at <a href="https://bit.ly/2zxQXCb">https://bit.ly/2zxQXCb</a>.</p>
<p>Poetry and prose, fiction and non-fiction, have been there for us while sheltered in place. People have sometimes turned to literature for escape. (I’ve read some fairly lightweight mysteries.) But literature has been there to inform, as well, as readers turning to books on pandemics or, lately, on race relations.</p>
<p>All in all, the arts have been good to us, and good for us. They were there, I bet, because the artists when young were shown how to drum, to sing, to rhyme, to paint, to draw, to photograph, to create. They learned how to connect, and these days connections have meant so much.</p>
<p>From his home in Livingston County, retired senior editor Jim Memmott will document the new normal of living in a socially distant world. He can be reached at <a href="mailto:jmemmott@gannett.com">jmemmott@gannett.com</a> or write Box 274, Geneseo, NY 14454.</p>

Nightbirds</p>
<p>by Labelle (1974)</p>
<p>In the early ’70s, Labelle traded their girl group image for a new futuristic look. Nightbirds gave them the sound to match. The album is a daring mesh of funk, soul, rock, and gospel that explores sexual liberation — still new territory for Black women in music — and social issues. Singles “Lady Marmalade” and “What Can I Do for You” proved that Nona, Sarah, and Patti’s voices had been restrained with doo-wop. Now they sounded free. — NC</p>
<p>They Say I’m Different</p>
<p>by Betty Davis (1974)</p>
<p>A pioneer of funk, Davis intrepidly sings as a sexually empowered woman who “used to tie him up” and “say all kinds of dirty thangs.” Songs like “He Was a Big Freak” and “Don’t Call Her No Tramp” show how raw and ungovernable the gravelly voiced singer was in her music, which outraged the NAACP. Credited with influencing Jimi Hendrix and Miles Davis — her ex-husband whose music and style evolved during their marriage — Davis was well ahead of her time. — CMT</p>
<p>Zoning</p>
<p>by Mary Lou Williams (1974)</p>
<p>The grand genius pianist who played through the changes (all of them!) across the 20th-century jazz revolution flexes her mastery of groove and her art of delivering sage, intricate musical statements. Having cut her teeth as a blues pianist, a boogie-woogie stylist, a godmother of bebop, and a composer of majestic compositions exploring her Catholic faith, Williams delivers an album that floats and glides back and forth across jazz history and takes us into the future. — DB</p>
<p>Natalie</p>
<p>by Natalie Cole (1976)</p>
<p>Under the hits “Mr. Melody” and “Sophisticated Lady (She’s a Different Lady),” there is effervescence and unforgettable vocal storytelling. But it’s within songs like “Heaven Is With You,” “No Plans for the Future,” “Can We Get Together Again,” and her cover of “Good Morning Heartache” that the melancholy and mania that define Cole’s creative life merge into a miracle. — DS</p>
<p>Transfiguration</p>
<p>by Alice Coltrane (1978)</p>
<p>Before the enlightened jazz guru ventured off into the world of devotional music, where she stayed for the remainder of her life, Coltrane recorded a live album with Reggie Workman on bass and Roy Haynes on drums, giving the audience at UCLA in Los Angeles an opportunity to hear what Coltrane was naturally working with. This free jazz album is executed with style, grace, and sentimentality toward the traditional jazz improvisational world she was leaving behind. — Jordannah Elizabeth</p>
<p>The Earthshaker</p>
<p>by Koko Taylor (1978)</p>
<p>The accuracy and wisdom found on the Queen of the Blues’ album transcend time. When she powerfully belts out, “You can have my husband, but please don’t mess with my man,” women of every age chuckle and nod. Chock full of blues-raunchy tunes that recall basement Bid Whist parties and adults taking a smoke out back, this album centers the badassery — and sexuality — of women. — ASG</p>
<p>The Boss</p>
<p>by Diana Ross (1979)</p>
<p>Deftly guided by legendary writers-producers Ashford and Simpson, The Boss captures the exuberance of the disco era with Ross’ unique breathy bravado. With each track, she solidifies her diva status as she coyly sings about the highs and lows of love. We defy anyone to listen to this collection without being tempted to twirl the night away on a smoke-filled lighted dance floor. — VDL</p>
<p>Please Be Patient With Me</p>
<p>by Albertina Walker (1979)</p>
<p>This album is so iconic that choirs still sing the title track, also a life lesson, that ends with this defiant fist shake to the haters: “When God is through with me, I’ll be exactly who He wants me to be.” The Grammy-nominated cuts were recorded live with the help of the Rev. James Cleveland and, says Walker, God. Said the Queen of Gospel of that day: “We had church in the recording session, and the Lord really blessed that album.” — ASG</p>
<p>We Are Family</p>
<p>by Sister Sledge (1979)</p>
<p>The breakout album from the Philadelphia-born quartet is stacked with classic disco-era hits that made them bona fide stars. A staple of family reunions and sporting events, the title track has indisputable energy and longevity. The allure of “Lost in Music,” “He’s the Greatest Dancer,” and “Thinking of You” instantly pull you right up outta your seat to look for the nearest dance floor. Even the slow jams compel you to two-step. — CMT</p>
<p>Donna Summers, 1979</p>
<p>Bad Girls</p>
<p>by Donna Summer (1979)</p>
<p>If you need proof that disco’s reputation as a cheesy subgenre is revisionist history, start with Summer’s concept masterpiece. The double LP runs the sonic gamut from dance hits like the title track to lingering ballads to edgy offerings like “Hot Stuff,” which garnered a Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. Had she debuted in a different era, Summer would likely be celebrated more as one of our most versatile voices. — NC</p>
<p>Diana</p>
<p>by Diana Ross (1980)</p>
<p>After she put out The Boss, Ross kept us twirling with the release of Diana. The album, with its infinite buoyancy and empowerment, marked the end of Ross’ Motown career and a new chapter to celebrate equality and freedom. It ushered in the megahit “Upside Down” and the lively ”Have Fun (Again)” while the liberating “I’m Coming Out” became an instant gay pride anthem. — CMT</p>
<p>You Brought the Sunshine</p>
<p>by The Clark Sisters (1981)</p>
<p>The Clark Sisters brought the funk, the groove, and the message back into gospel music with this record. Every track carries that distinguished “Clark Sound” of high harmonies, masterful runs, and powerful vocals that are the envy of any choir or soloist. But don’t let the old-school gospel sound fool you, these sisters (and their mother, who is featured on the album) were subtly speaking to the problems of the times, including drug abuse, in their chart-topping offering. — JAD</p>
<p>Strauss: Four Last Songs</p>
<p>by Jessye Norman (1983)</p>
<p>“Norman was among the leading singers in her generation with a rich dramatic soprano voice that excelled in German and French repertoire” Naomi André says. Norman, who won four Grammys during her lifetime, delivers an unforgettable performance anchored in control and precision. — CMT</p>
<p>Break Out</p>
<p>by The Pointer Sisters (1983)</p>
<p>There’s a special skin tingle that happens when you blast this album from the speakers. Energetic and vivacious, The Pointer Sisters knew how to get the joint jumping with sassy vocals and synthesized music that has ’80s written all over it. The old-time church influence is undeniable, yet the entire album is utterly of-the-moment. — VDL</p>
<p>I’m in Love Again</p>
<p>by Patti LaBelle (1983)</p>
<p>“If Only You Knew” gave us a heart-wrenching, pining ballad that’ll make any slow jams list. “Love, Need and Want You” is a sexy classic that would become a popular sample for future generations of musicians. The album, as a whole, revealed the multitudes contained in all Black women’s hearts and lives, and it’s classic LaBelle: sexy, heartfelt, powerful. — JAD</p>
<p>Private Dancer</p>
<p>by Tina Turner (1984)</p>
<p>Turner’s seminal album is one of the greatest second acts in music. She had never been a core R&amp;B singer. But launching a comeback with a rock ’n’ roll album at 44 years old after multiple failed solo efforts seemed impossible. The LP’s multiplatinum success, anchored by “What’s Love Got to Do With It,” was as much a testament to Turner’s resilience as her talent. — NC</p>
<p>Whitney Houston</p>
<p>by Whitney Houston (1985)</p>
<p>The eponymous album marked the emergence of a groundbreaking new voice and has since become one of the biggest-selling debut albums of all time. These wonderful ballads allowed Houston to harness the full extent of her vocal power and inspired a whole generation of female singers. — Morgan Jerkins, ZORA senior editor</p>
<p>Control</p>
<p>by Janet Jackson (1986)</p>
<p>Control was one of the most groundbreaking albums of its kind. Jackson put dance on the map with hits that paved her own unique path in the industry. It was motivating, pulsating, and inspirational. Her style of performance has influenced the likes of many who have followed in her footsteps. — MC Lyte</p>
<p>Rapture</p>
<p>by Anita Baker (1986)</p>
<p>The album is full of smooth and confident lyrics. Baker sang from a woman’s perspective to show strength and vulnerability. She coasted over the masterfully composed instrumentation and made it so stylized that you were never confused about who you were listening to. — MCL

Bruce Lee&rsquo;s famed career as an actor and director in Hollywood as well as most notably in the form of a gifted martial artist, has been brought back to life thanks to ESPN&rsquo;s 30 for 30 documentary, Be Water. Directed by Bao Nguyen, Be Water delves deeper into Bruce Lee&rsquo;s legacy as a martial artist and his successful career in Hollywood. The documentary also sheds light on facing racial discrimination when trying to land lead roles in Hollywood. While the documentary provides an inside look at Bruce Lee&rsquo;s career, here is a look at the Bruce Lee family.</p>

Lee Hoi-Chuen and Grace Ho had five children - Phoebe Lee, Agnes Lee, Peter Lee, Bruce Lee and Robert Lee. Lee Hoi-Chuen died in 1965, one week after the birth of Bruce Lee&rsquo;s son, Brandon.</p>

<h3 id="the-8-most-alluring-classical-recordings-of-the-year-so-far">&ldquo;The 8 most alluring classical recordings of the year, so far&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/9n0VXkM1gikLX2YIkjFm7YEFW-Q=/1200x0/right/top/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/PJOGITE7DZDRZGGUNWQO2D63IA.jpg" alt="img">
This gathering of significant works by American composer James Lentini comes at precisely the right moment, for his scores inspire hope and faith, as the recording eloquently attests. Spanning 1994 through 2010, the compositions collected here range from orchestral tone poems to a profoundly philosophical symphony, from purely instrumental work to solo-choral-orchestral pieces. The title composition, Lentini’s Symphony No. 1, stands as the recording’s centerpiece, sumptuously performed by the Sofia Philharmonic Orchestra, Ricardo Averbach conducting. A major statement, the opus opens with “Reflection,” a first movement that combines sweeping lyricism with virtuosic orchestral writing. The perpetual-motion passages of “A New Destiny,” the second movement, give way to passages of a questing nature, underscoring the work’s depth and rigor. Lentini’s celebratory Sinfonia di Festa (1996) evokes shades of Howard Hanson, yet it manages to convey grandeur while maintaining textural transparency (in a performance by the Bohuslav Martinu Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Anthony Iannaccone). And Lentini’s “Three Sacred Meditations” ranks alongside the best writing of composer Peter Lieberson via soaring vocal lines, emotional urgency and glistening orchestration (performed by soprano Dana Lentini, the composer’s wife, and the Wayne State University Symphonic Chorus &amp; Orchestra, led by Norah Duncan IV). In all, music that rewards repeated hearings. (Navona Records)

<h3 id="jess-knights-takes-a-stance-studies-heartbreak-on-best-kind-of-light">&ldquo;Jess Knights takes a stance, studies heartbreak on Best Kind of Light&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thechronicleherald.ca/media/photologue/photos/cache/0618_arts_feat_knights-w-20200617113008jpg_medium" alt="img">
A A</p>
<p>Jess Knights calls it her Tinder song.</p>
<p>On Try A Little Harder, the soul and blues singer rebuffs prospective suitors who use lazy lines and make lazy assumptions about who or what deserves her attention. Backed by a crawling blues groove and punctuated by growling slashes of distorted guitar, Knights puts them in their place with sultry power. “Don’t be fooled by my smile,” she sings “I’m the Queen of the Lions, I know how to bite.”</p>
<p>It’s defiant, often funny and full of attitude; not so much in the “that-man-done-me-wrong” school of songwriting as “don’t-even-try-me-if-you’re-not-up-to-it.”</p>
<p>“I wrote it in response to the lack of effort on some of these dating apps,” says Knights, in an interview with Postmedia from her Calgary home. “They don’t require a lot from people to make connections. There’s a lot of ‘Hey baby’ and ‘Hey girl.’ It’s like: ‘No, no, no. I’m not your baby. I’m not your girl. You don’t even know my name yet. Try a little harder, man. I don’t have time for this unless you’re going to try.’ ”</p>
<p>Knights plays the part so convincingly that it would be understandable if she chose to ride this cheeky blues vibe for an entire album. But the songs on Best Kind of Light build on the significant promise of her 2018 debut EP Won’t Wait, revealing her to be as comfortable with soulful balladry, explosive R&amp;B, retro-soul and well-crafted pop as she is exploring various shades of the blues.</p>
<p>Recorded in Toronto with producer Joshua Van Tassel, her debut full-length is an assured collection that veers from rousing funk anthems such as Baby, Won’t You Stay, to stately ballads such as Halfway, to the AOR pop of Young and Foolish and soulful-folk drama of the title track. A classically trained singer, Knights’ powers as a vocal stylist are matched by a supple studio band and perceptive production by Van Tassel that gives the record a polished, old-school sheen without sacrificing urgency and energy.</p>
<p>“I really wanted to connect back to the music that I love most, which is really rooted in the deep-soul traditions of Donny Hathaway and Sam Cooke and Sharon Jones,” she says. “Everywhere on the album, I think Josh did a really good job of bringing that feeling forward in all the songs. When I expressed to him that this was the music that I loved and this was the music that I feel, he really took that to heart. It was like ‘OK, we’ll find a way to make this as soulful as it can be and tap into that expression that means so much to me and so many others.”</p>
<p>While the album jumps in and out of genres, it also displays a variety of tones within Knights’ delivery and lyrics. Both the aforementioned Try A Little Harder and the wry and “sadly very autobiographical” This is 30 are cheerfully irreverent, while the jazzy Try it On and sultry Curtain Call are fragile, yearning and seductive.</p>
<p>“A recurring theme on the album and Won’t Wait as well is that age-old story of heartbreak,” Knights says with a laugh. “I think that’s sprinkled throughout. Best Kind of Light is about leaving a relationship with grace and integrity and choosing to look back on things and your ex-relationship in the best kind of way. Leave Me For the Last Time, it’s like ‘You’re leaving me for the last time, and I’m going to be OK.’ ”</p>
<p>Still, two of the album’s most powerful songs have Knights looking outside of herself for inspiration. The stinging blues of Cover Your Eyes covers everything from the sins of the clergy to homelessness and poverty in its exploration of mankind’s unyielding ability to look the other way. One Last Shot, with its rolling piano and rapid-fire delivery, is a melodic and surprisingly joyful take-to-the-streets anthem that seems particularly timely given the political unrest around the world.</p>
<p>“I definitely write from a personal and emotional place about heartbreak and love songs,” she says. “But I also write from a place of observation and taking a stance on things.”</p>
<p>One Last Shot, she says, is a protest song and one that, in hindsight, she wishes she had released as a single. Knights has been deeply moved by the Black Lives Matter movement these past few weeks and all proceeds from the sale of Best Kind of Light on June 19 and 20 will be donated to the Alberta Civil Liberties Research Centre.</p>
<p>“It’s about fighting for what you believe in, standing up for what’s right,” she says. “It’s about the thrill of the protest and the march and the victory.”</p>
<p>Knights studied opera and classical singing as a child before spending some formative years travelling the world. A former manager of education and public programming at the National Music Centre, Knights also spent a decade learning her chops in Calgary’s rough-and-ready, do-or-die blues scene.</p>
<p>As with many musicians releasing albums in the past few months, her plans to tour and promote Best Kind of Light, which were to include dates throughout Western Canada and Ontario, were derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. She will perform on Facebook Live on June 20 at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>“I think I grieved about things, and now I’m like ‘OK, what are you going to do about it? What are you going to look forward to?’ ” she says. “Because wallowing doesn’t really serve anybody and it’s not a great use of our energy.”</p>
<p>So the planning continues, even if it’s all tentative.</p>
<p>“I really do want to take the show on the road,” she says. “My band is wonderful and keen. The band I have here in Calgary are open to touring Western Canada and the band that I recorded with in Toronto said ‘Hey, when you’re out here, give us a call.’ So it’s nice to have bands both in Eastern and Western Canada. So, yeah, the end goal is to take it on the road.”</p>
<p>Best Kind of Light will be released June 19 on all streaming services. Proceeds from sales on June 19 and 20 will go to the Alberta Civil Liberties Research Centre. Jess Knights: Live from the Speakeasy will be live-streamed on Facebook Live on June 20 at 7 p.m. with her full band.</p>

<h3 id="from-celia-cruz-to-rihanna-15-albums-that-shaped-music">&ldquo;From Celia Cruz to Rihanna: 15 Albums That Shaped Music&rdquo;</h3>

From Celia Cruz to Rihanna: 15 Albums That Shaped Music</p>
<p>We celebrate the global sensations of the Black diaspora</p>
<p>This story is a part of the ZORA Music Canon, a celebration of Black women musical artists.</p>
<p>The ZORA Music Canon, our list of the most iconic albums by African American women, honors 100 masterworks and the Black American artists who created them. But we know Black women’s impact is not exclusive to the United States. It’s worldwide and limitless. To celebrate the vast reach of the diaspora, this list celebrates Black women from around the world whose influence exceeds borders.</p>
<p>Celia Cruz was the Queen of Salsa and a global sensation who stood out with her vibrant outfits, distinct voice, and her authenticity to Cuba’s rich musical history. In 1966 she released Son Con Guaguancó, her first record as a solo artist. The album was significant in many ways. It marked her life in exile in the United States while establishing her musical approach to fuse Afro-Cuban son and guaguancó rhythms with elements of rumba, mambo, and cha-cha.</p>
<p>Miriam Makeba, endearingly known as Mama Africa, was the South African singer-songwriter who spent the majority of her career exiled from her home country for speaking out against the atrocities of apartheid in her music. Though her 1967 album Pata Pata has upbeat and melodic moments, it was the theme of social justice that made her purpose much greater than being an entertainer. “I made that decision,” Makeba told NPR in 2006. “And from then on, I was branded that artist who sings politics.”</p>
<p>Poly Styrene was an icon in the punk scene, becoming the first woman of color to lead a punk band, as well as being one of the first Black women in rock in the U.K. Leading X-Ray Spex, Styrene, who was of Somali descent, was the creative force behind the success of the band, despite only releasing one album, Germfree Adolescents, with the original members in 1978. The debut, with Styrene at the helm, achieved critical acclaim.</p>
<p>Grace Jones is the epitome of confidence and multifaceted talent. The Jamaican-born singer-songwriter, producer, model, and actor is progressive with her music, diving into reggae, funk, post-punk, and pop. You can hear those sounds in her 1981 album Nightclubbing. The album showed an evolved Jones, who moved past her earlier disco repertoire and gave us one of the greatest hits in “Pull Up to the Bumper.” Donning a black blazer and flattop, with a cigarette in her mouth, she also produced iconic album art to match.</p>
<p>Sade is the Nigerian-born British singer-songwriter whose mystery and charm is felt in the sound of her raspy-textured voice. After overcoming stage fright during her three years of singing backup for Latin funk band Pride, she would release “Your Love Is King,” the lead single on the 1984 album Diamond Life. Journalist and author Danyel Smith tells ZORA that Diamond Life is an “audacious debut,” and marvels at the lyrics. “Songwriting at genius level,” Smith says. “Sade hovers above the intersection of strength and vulnerability: a siren, a daredevil, an angel.”</p>
<p>Oumou Sangaré is the Malian beacon of Wassoulou music, a historical region touching Mali, Guinea, and Côte d’Ivoire. In 1989, Sangaré released her most defining album, Moussolou. It spoke on behalf of African women in a way her contemporaries didn’t. The songstress, whose songs center around love and freedom of choice in marriage, landed a Grammy for best pop collaboration with vocals in 2011 for her contribution to “Imagine,” alongside Herbie Hancock and a star-studded line-up.</p>
<p>Patra, one of Jamaica’s outspoken female dancehall artists, stepped onto the scene after a stint as a DJ in the late 1980s. Her debut album in 1993, Queen of the Pack, symbolized the artist’s desire “to empower women across the world,” she told the Jamaica Gleaner last year. She added, “for me it was about being a woman and respecting my African roots and culture. I had the braids at the time to represent the African thing, too… it’s a complete package for me, it’s a sex appeal thing and I was representing all girls because somebody had to say it in that time.”</p>
<p>Angelique Kidjo is the multilingual Beninese singer best known for being among the greats who gave African music a global platform. She tapped into the continent and diaspora’s diverse musical influences including Afropop, zouk, jazz, and Congolese rumba. Kidjo’s 1994 album, Ayé, produced her first Grammy nomination for the song “Agolo.” She would go on to win four Grammys — including best world music album for her Celia Cruz commemorative project in 2020.</p>
<p>Tania León is a lauded Cuban-born classical composer, educator, and adviser for the arts. Since moving to the United States in 1967, she became a founding member and the first musical director of Arthur Mitchell’s Dance Theater of Harlem. León has written chamber works, orchestral works, solo piano, vocal works, and operas — most notably Scourge of Hyacinths — which took home the BMW Prize for best new opera in 1994.</p>
<p>Les Nubians, the neo-soul French-Cameroonian duo, are the French-speaking musical group known for a successful crossover moment in the United States with their popular song, “Makeda,” from their Grammy-nominated 1998 record, Princesses Nubiennes. The duo, sisters Hélène and Célia Faussart, were awarded with a Soul Train Lady of Soul award for best new artist, group, or duo a year later.</p>
<p>Rihanna, who recently celebrated the 15-year anniversary of her first single, “Pon de Replay,” is an absolute powerhouse. When she dropped Good Girl Gone Bad in 2007, the Bajan would-be mogul showed her sonic range by switching up her sound with bangers like “Don’t Stop the Music” and “Shut Up and Drive.” The chart-topping success of the album’s lead single “Umbrella,” a collaboration with Jay-Z, elevated her profile, giving way to her meteoric rise. The track also gave Rihanna her first Grammy. Her albums Loud and Anti followed, captivating audiences now awaiting her next project.</p>
<p>Floetry, the Black-British duo of Marsha Ambrosius (The Songstress) and Natalie Stewart (The Floacist), not only reintroduced the use of poetry and spoken word throughout music, but also helped develop what we now know to be neo-soul. The group’s 2002 album Floetic features timeless singles like “Floetic” and “Say Yes,” which was on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart for 20 weeks.</p>
<p>Alison Hinds’ 2007 debut album Soca Queen was the soca artist’s declaration that she indeed owns that label. A native of Barbados, she introduced the world to a different approach to the festive sound. In tracks like “Faluma” and “Roll It Gal,” Hinds doesn’t hesitate to celebrate the Caribbean’s connection to the African continent. With Trinidad and Tobago having the genre on lock, Hinds put Barbados on the soca map.</p>
<p>Nicki Minaj is one of the most influential female rappers of all time. With her nimble lyrical ability, Minaj has the most Billboard Hot 100 hits of any female artist, surpassing Aretha Franklin’s record in 2017. She currently has 109 hits (and counting) to her credit. The Trinidad and Tobago-born star, who also represents Queens, New York, made a statement with Pink Friday in 2010. The project would go on to peak at number one on the charts and be certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.</p>
<p>FKA Twigs is the genre-bender who’s truly a performance artist in her own right. The Jamaican-British singer-songwriter draws from electronic music, R&amp;B, trip-hop, and choral music to express how she pushes through pain and heartbreak in search of happiness. Magdalene, her sophomore project released in 2019, does just that. Yale professor Daphne Brooks describes the album to ZORA as “the sonic realization of Black feminist existentialism and spiritual questing.”</p>
