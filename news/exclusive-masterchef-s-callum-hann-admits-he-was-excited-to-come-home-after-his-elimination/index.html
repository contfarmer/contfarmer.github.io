<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Of course I took the competition seriously but also when you get eliminated it&rsquo;s nice to have someone to come home to.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a tear-jerking final cook for Callum Hann in the MasterChef kitchen on Tuesday night when he narrowly missed out on a spot in the top three. The season two runner-up and dad-of-one didn&rsquo;t quite hit the mark with his final fish dish but as a veteran contestant he became a fan favourite of the series. Callum called Now To Love following his elimination to discuss his highlights on the show, why he wants his pal Laura Sharrad to win the season and why having his wife and daughter with him during filming made all the difference when COVID-19 was raging.</p>
<p>Now To Love: That was a particularly emotional cook for you, how was it watching your elimination on screen? Callum: It was tough watching it back because obviously there&rsquo;s the competition you see on screen but what you don&rsquo;t necessarily see on screen is the fact that when we were filming it that&rsquo;s when COVID was really terrible. My business was closing down because we had to, like so many other businesses, so there were a few factors at play. Not to mention Laura&rsquo;s a great mate of mine and having to cook head-to-head against her wasn&rsquo;t a lot of fun in that regard. That was pretty sweet when she mentioned that she fangirled over you back when you starred on season two though. Yeah, I feel exactly the same way about someone like Poh who was on season one. Poh was one of the reasons I applied for the show in the first place and I got to cook against her in this competition. Did you get many of the more recent contestants approaching you telling you that you inspired them to go on the show? Certainly a few but at the same time I have just as much I have respect for them and for the skills they&rsquo;ve shown. We all know how hard it is to be away from friends and family so I think there&rsquo;s a lot of mutual respect.</p>

<p>Speaking of friends and family, you were able to have your wife Crystal and baby daughter Elle with you. How did that make a difference? When the borders were going to close between South Australia and Victoria we had to make a decision. A. I complete the show, B. We stay in our respective states or C. My wife and baby came over to Melbourne and that&rsquo;s the option we ended up going with because when we first started filming the show Elle was three-months-old so I didn&rsquo;t want to miss that important time of her life. It was really good for me, it was tough for Crystal and Elle because normally at home you have a mum or a friend or a family member who can help out a bit whereas she had no help so I was trying to do what I could but I was filming. It was tough but obviously it was awesome having them there during such a tricky time. The other contestants embraced both of them being there - we&rsquo;re all in separate serviced apartments but we&rsquo;d all go round for dinner together like a big happy family. The contestants would hang out and cook for each other and you can see that bond between the contestants in places like last night, it ends up getting a little bit emotional. WATCH BELOW: MasterChef&rsquo;s Callum talks about his family. Post continues after video&hellip;</p>
<p>A lot of people talk about how becoming a parent changes you - how do you think you&rsquo;ve changed now you&rsquo;re a dad? I guess I didn&rsquo;t have that much time to change to be honest as I&rsquo;d only been a dad for three months when we started filming. I guess it&rsquo;s a good way of re-prioritising your life and all of a sudden you&rsquo;ve got someone else to look out for - there are other things that are more important in life than just doing work or in this case a competition like this. I think that sort of reality check was actually really good for me - of course I took the competition seriously but also when you get eliminated it&rsquo;s nice to have someone to come home to. I was really excited to get home and get back to the life that I love. So when is Elle going to learn how to cook? [Laughs] Well she&rsquo;s crawling around at the moment so she&rsquo;s not quite at bench-height yet! We&rsquo;ve been feeding her lots of different thing and she smashes everything, it&rsquo;s incredible. She&rsquo;s a great eater - I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything I&rsquo;ve offered her that she hasn&rsquo;t wolfed down! If someone&rsquo;s a good eater then hopefully she&rsquo;ll be keen to get in the kitchen and give me a hand as she gets a little bit older.</p>

<p>You mentioned that you had no regrets in the competition except the fish in your elimination. Do you stand by that? A hundred per cent, you can&rsquo;t have regrets. To be honest I feel like considering there were 24 people at the start of the competition that had all worked in the food industry and had done the competition once before, my goal was just not to be the first one eliminated and to get past a whole bunch of chefs that were really incredible cooks. Of course I would&rsquo;ve loved to have gone a little bit further but at the same time I&rsquo;m pretty proud of how I went and where I got to. There were some full-on challenges and celebrity guests this season, what was your MasterChef: Back To Win highlight? The obvious answer is when I got to cook alongside Gordon Ramsay all the way back in week one - that was something really special and really incredible. But at the same time, as much as meeting all the well-known chefs was really cool and an awesome part of being on a show like that, for me meeting the contestants and spending time with some of those guys and getting to know them a little bit better, cooking dinner and hanging out with them was a real highlight. I really enjoyed the period of filming because of that camaraderie that we had.</p>

<p>You mentioned that you&rsquo;re close with Laura who&rsquo;s copped a lot of flack for being Jock&rsquo;s favourite and cooking only pasta dishes. Is it tough to hear that sort of stuff as her friend? I think it&rsquo;s tough to hear for me just because I don&rsquo;t think either of those things are true. The episode I got eliminated was something like episode 63 and I&rsquo;m not sure if people are watching the same show I&rsquo;m watching because if you actually watch the show I reckon she&rsquo;s made maybe five pasta dishes out of 63 episodes. If I owned a pasta restaurant and everyone loved my pasta, I&rsquo;d be cooking five pasta dishes as well, probably more! Everyone plays to their strengths - Reese and Emelia make cakes for a living so of course they make a lot of desserts, Reynold&rsquo;s got his dessert bar so of course he&rsquo;s going to whip out his favourite desserts off the menu. I think everyone plays to their strengths and you&rsquo;ve got to - I think the reason that Laura&rsquo;s still there now is because A she&rsquo;s a good cook and B she&rsquo;s smart and she&rsquo;s played to her strengths and managed to get through. I think where some of that criticism has come from is because she cooked a couple of pasta dishes in the first few episodes and then it sort of stuck but then from there she hardly cooked pasta again. It was a mob mentality rather than actually being accurate.</p>

<p>We think we know the answer to this one but who do you want to see win of the remaining three? I think you know the answer as well! I am genuinely really good mates with Emelia and Reynold as well and have become so over the last six months but it&rsquo;s hard to go past someone who you&rsquo;ve been mates with for six or seven years who I catch up with outside filming as well. I&rsquo;d love to see Laura take it out and I think she&rsquo;s probably got the skills to do so but at the same time I think any of the three of them could win so it&rsquo;s going to be an interesting final couple of challenges.

<h3 id="eliminated-masterchef-contestant-callum-hann-to-miss-dream-feeds">&ldquo;Eliminated MasterChef contestant Callum Hann to miss dream feeds&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.s.perthnow.com.au/publication/B881609202Z/1594771200095_G9B2R8K2R.1-2.jpg?imwidth=1024" alt="img">
If there’s one thing Callum Hann will miss about MasterChef, it’s “eating like a king” every day after the cameras stopped rolling.</p>
<p>The South Australian was finally eliminated from Ten’s cooking competition last night, leaving Laura Sharrad, Emelia Jackson and Reynold Poernomo to fight it out for MasterChef’s Back to Win title.</p>
<p>While disappointed to come so close to victory, Hann says he’ll always cherish the experience and the camaraderie between the contestants.</p>
<p>“We were all living in the same apartment building and you’d be chilling on the couch and you’d get a knock on the door and it’s Poh (Ling Yeow) with her creme brulee and she wants you to try it,” Hann said.</p>
<p>“Or half an hour later, Laura comes up and she’s made this beautiful olive and rosemary focaccia and she wants you to take a bite.</p>
<p>“That sort of stuff happened all the time &hellip; we just ate like kings. What some people would dream of was just everyday life for a couple of months.”</p>
<p>“It’s all those little moments, outside of the kitchen, that’s how we all became great mates and started genuinely caring about each other.”</p>
<p>Hann, who won a mini MasterChef All Stars series in 2012, came up against fellow South Aussie Laura in a final head-to-head battle, which he described as a “no-win situation”.</p>
<p>“Either I get eliminated which sucks, or I win the challenge and I effectively eliminate Laura, which doesn’t make me very happy either,” he says. “But overall I’m really proud of myself and what I achieved.”</p>
<p>Just 20 years old when he finished runner-up on the 2010 season of the show, Callum became a father just three months before going to shoot the new series in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Baby Elle and wife Crystal came over to live with him for the last two months of filming.</p>
<p>“It really kept me grounded. You can get caught up in the little things in the competition and think about the criticism but having Elle, who just wants to give you a little cuddle&hellip; it gives you a great perspective and actually helps your performance,” says Hann, who’s now focusing on his Sprout Cooking School with good friend and business partner Themis Chryssidis.

<p><img src="https://media.apnarm.net.au/media/images/2020/07/15/v3imagesbin9f236c56d63da2904ef2adf7ff3a9d4e-j2llug61sycd4nqdou2_ct1880x930.jpg" alt="img">
There wasn&rsquo;t a dry eye in the MasterChef kitchen as beloved season two star Callum Hann was booted from the competition on Tuesday - and over on Twitter, it seemed much the same among fans.</p>
<p>Viewers were heartbroken when this season&rsquo;s Mr Nice Guy was sent packing, with many taking to social media to praise the humble star.</p>
<p>Former MasterChef winner Adam Liaw paid tribute to Callum on Twitter and joked that his nice guy persona is &ldquo;all an act&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You all really need to know that @callumskitchen&rsquo;s wholesome nice guy persona on #MasterChefAU is all an act. In reality he&rsquo;s actually even nicer,&rdquo; Liaw wrote.</p>
<p>Last night&rsquo;s episode was another extremely emotional one. Cooking against close friend and fellow Adelaide chef, Laura Sharrad, Callum was teary throughout the episode as the weight of the challenge dawned on him.</p>
<p>The texture of his snapper ultimately let him down, and he was farewelled with a thoughtful send-off from Melissa Leong, who was full of praise for the fan favourite.</p>
<p>While the judges and contestants were clearly emotional as they said goodbye, strict social distancing measures meant no hugging - a solemn elbow tap the only option.</p>
<p>Melissa had tears in her eyes while saying goodbye to Callum Hann. Picture: Channel 10</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name Callum Hann is synonymous with this competition,&rdquo; judge Melissa said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;10 years ago you might have walked into this kitchen as a boy, but this time you&rsquo;ve returned as a dad&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every time you walk through those doors, humility and integrity has always followed. We are so proud of you,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Callum was overcome with emotion following his cook against Laura, asking producers for a minute as he composed himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It kinda just hit me there at the end of the cook,&rdquo; he said once he&rsquo;d finished, his eyes filling with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last few nights months have been massive inside and outside the competition … I&rsquo;m feeling really emotional because either Laura is sending me home or vice versa which really sucks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he began his cook, he had commented that it was going to be a tough trot in the kitchen given he was up against his close friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can genuinely say this will be the hardest challenge for me for this season,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laura and I have worked together, we&rsquo;ve been mates for six years, she&rsquo;s a really deserving person to be in the semi-final as well. To feel like I&rsquo;m either being eliminated or I&rsquo;m gonna be eliminating a mate is really tough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura and Callum were both in tears during the episode. Picture: Channel 10</p>
<p>In a two-pronged challenge that saw Reynold sent to the safety of the gantry after round one with Emelia, who won Monday&rsquo;s Gordon Ramsay Mystery Box, Callum and Laura were left battling it out for a spot in the semi final.</p>
<p>In the end, Callum&rsquo;s mushy fish let him down, despite the flavours of his creation wowing the judges.</p>
<p>It certainly wasn&rsquo;t an easy farewell, with Laura admitting she had &ldquo;fangirled&rdquo; over Callum when he came second to Adam Liaw in season 2.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought that we would be here together,&rdquo; Laura said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve worked together, we&rsquo;ve hung out, we&rsquo;re really good friends and it&rsquo;s been really amazing to do it with someone who is as amazing as Callum. He&rsquo;s so loving, so humble, so gracious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an amazing dad. He should be really proud of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fans were equally as devastated to see the star go, taking to Twitter to air their tears.</p>
<p>In my eyes, not matter what the outcome tonight, @callumskitchen is an outright winner. He’s just made the whole country love him all over again and he should be very proud of the food he’s produced. #MasterChefAU — Bec Derrington (@becderrington) July 14, 2020</p>
<p>Masterchef is honestly the most wholesome show on television right now. The tears that I cry everytime because everyone is so beautiful 😭 #MasterChefAU — John (@boavjda) July 14, 2020</p>
<p>Men like Callum and Adam Liaw should be held up as symbols of what Australian men could and should be</p>
<p>Instead lol heres some Bachelor in Paradise and MAFS #MasterChefAU — Heath (@popculturepooka) July 14, 2020</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really excited to get back to Adelaide,&rdquo; Callum told the camera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My beautiful wife, Crystal, has sacrificed a lot for me to be here for that, so, just excited to get home and give them both a cuddle and be there as much as I possibly can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reynold Poernomo, Emelia Jackson and Laura Sharrad are heading into the semi-finals on Sunday, with</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s leading bookmakers are all tipping Emelia to win MasterChef, with the cook having held the top spot as favourite for weeks.</p>

With eliminations looming, emotions go the better of Callum and Laura as they compete to win a place in the semi-finals.</p>
<p>There wasn’t a dry eye in the MasterChef kitchen as beloved season two star Callum Hann was booted from the competition on Tuesday – and over on Twitter, it seemed much the same among fans.</p>
<p>Viewers were heartbroken when this season’s Mr Nice Guy was sent packing, with many taking to social media to praise the humble star.</p>
<p>Former MasterChef winner Adam Liaw paid tribute to Callum on Twitter and joked that his nice guy persona is “all an act”.</p>
<p>“You all really need to know that @callumskitchen’s wholesome nice guy persona on #MasterChefAU is all an act. In reality he’s actually even nicer,” Liaw wrote.</p>
<p>Last night’s episode was another extremely emotional one. Cooking against close friend and fellow Adelaide chef, Laura Sharrad, Callum was teary throughout the episode as the weight of the challenge dawned on him.</p>
<p>The texture of his snapper ultimately let him down, and he was farewelled with a thoughtful send-off from Melissa Leong, who was full of praise for the fan favourite.</p>
<p>While the judges and contestants were clearly emotional as they said goodbye, strict social distancing measures meant no hugging — a solemn elbow tap the only option.</p>

<p>“The name Callum Hann is synonymous with this competition,” judge Melissa said.</p>
<p>“10 years ago you might have walked into this kitchen as a boy, but this time you’ve returned as a dad”</p>
<p>“Every time you walk through those doors, humility and integrity has always followed. We are so proud of you,” she added.</p>
<p>Callum was overcome with emotion following his cook against Laura, asking producers for a minute as he composed himself.</p>
<p>“It kinda just hit me there at the end of the cook,” he said once he’d finished, his eyes filling with tears.</p>
<p>“The last few nights months have been massive inside and outside the competition … I’m feeling really emotional because either Laura is sending me home or vice versa which really sucks.”</p>
<p>When he began his cook, he had commented that it was going to be a tough trot in the kitchen given he was up against his close friend.</p>
<p>“I can genuinely say this will be the hardest challenge for me for this season,” he said.</p>
<p>“Laura and I have worked together, we’ve been mates for six years, she’s a really deserving person to be in the semi-final as well. To feel like I’m either being eliminated or I’m gonna be eliminating a mate is really tough.”</p>
<p>RELATED: Co-stars defend Laura amid backlash</p>
<p>In a two-pronged challenge that saw Reynold sent to the safety of the gantry after round one with Emelia, who won Monday’s Gordon Ramsay Mystery Box, Callum and Laura were left battling it out for a spot in the semi final.</p>
<p>In the end, Callum’s mushy fish let him down, despite the flavours of his creation wowing the judges.</p>
<p>It certainly wasn’t an easy farewell, with Laura admitting she had “fangirled” over Callum when he came second to Adam Liaw in season 2.</p>
<p>“I never thought that we would be here together,” Laura said.</p>
<p>“We’ve worked together, we’ve hung out, we’re really good friends and it’s been really amazing to do it with someone who is as amazing as Callum. He’s so loving, so humble, so gracious.</p>
<p>“He’s an amazing dad. He should be really proud of himself.”</p>
<p>Fans were equally as devastated to see the star go, taking to Twitter to air their tears.</p>
<p>In my eyes, not matter what the outcome tonight, @callumskitchen is an outright winner. He’s just made the whole country love him all over again and he should be very proud of the food he’s produced. #MasterChefAU — Bec Derrington (@becderrington) July 14, 2020</p>
<p>Masterchef is honestly the most wholesome show on television right now. The tears that I cry everytime because everyone is so beautiful 😭 #MasterChefAU — John (@boavjda) July 14, 2020</p>
<p>Callum is quite possibly the nicest guy ever. #MasterchefAU — Thomas Nguyen (@ThomasHNguyen) July 14, 2020</p>
<p>There are not enough words to describe Callum. What a man. #MasterChefAU — Kate (@kateannyates) July 14, 2020</p>
<p>Nooooooo Callum is eliminated 😭😭😭😭😭🙏😭</p>

<p>We all know he has a cooking school but Callum has also taught the value in being kind and supportive and gracious and positive, and I’m going to miss that on my TV. #MasterChefAU — Sir Kumference (@sirkumference) July 14, 2020</p>
<p>Men like Callum and Adam Liaw should be held up as symbols of what Australian men could and should be</p>
<p>Instead lol heres some Bachelor in Paradise and MAFS #MasterChefAU — Heath (@popculturepooka) July 14, 2020</p>
<p>“I’m really excited to get back to Adelaide,” Callum told the camera.</p>
<p>“My beautiful wife, Crystal, has sacrificed a lot for me to be here for that, so, just excited to get home and give them both a cuddle and be there as much as I possibly can.”</p>
<p>Reynold Poernomo, Emelia Jackson and Laura Sharrad are heading into the semi-finals on Sunday, with</p>
<p>Australia’s leading bookmakers are all tipping Emelia to win MasterChef, with the cook having held the top spot as favourite for weeks.</p>
<p>MasterChef: Back to Win continues Sunday night from 7.30pm on Channel 10.

<h3 id="masterchef-2020-mass-amounts-of-davidson-plums-baffle-viewers">&ldquo;MasterChef 2020: Mass amounts of Davidson plums baffle viewers&rdquo;</h3>

MasterChef’s elimination left Australia in shock as we were forced to say goodbye to dessert king Reece Hignell.</p>
<p>Most eyes were on Reece Hignell’s departure from the MasterChef kitchen last night.</p>
<p>But some viewers also noticed there was one star of the show that, unlike Reece, was going great guns in the kitchen.</p>
<p>A star ingredient that is: the Davidson plum.</p>
<p>The native ingredient popped up in contestant Callum Hann’s dish last night but has also been featured in numerous other meals in the last few weeks.</p>
<p>The Davidson plum is almost as omnipresent in the kitchen as the now Australia-famous hibachi grill.</p>
<p>“Is MasterChef sponsored by Davidson plum? Seriously?” asked one fan.</p>
<p>“If someone made a Davidson plum cremaux and cooked it on the hibachi, we would have peak MasterChef 2020.”</p>
<p>RELATED: Reece Hignell was ‘heartbroken’ by elimination</p>
<p>Last night, Callum almost got sent home for his dish of aniseed myrtle chocolate cremaux, Davidson plum sorbet, shaved macadamia and aniseed myrtle pebbles.</p>
<p>He said it had a “native Cherry Ripe” vibe but the judges said it was an overpowering and “confused” dessert.</p>

<p>But no wonder the contestants keep plumping for the plum – it’s proven to be a winner. And as the star of his dish in a sorbet, it may even have saved Callum.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it’s cropped up in numerous forms, from sorbets, to gels and granitas.</p>
<p>Reece has made a wallaby and pepper berry pie with Davidson plum jam. Laura Sharrad’s “native winter” dessert spectacular featured Davidson plum and Callum is a big fan of using it in a savoury dish as a gel alongside his chicken liver parfait.</p>
<p>What’s the bet the grand final winning dish is a Davidson plum cooked on the Hibachi #MasterChefAU — Geo Kara (@geokara) July 12, 2020</p>
<p>Was Davidson plum a sponsor this season? #MasterChefAU — Hungry Hippo (@librarywmbt) July 12, 2020</p>
<p>Davidson plum on sale in Coles or something?? It’s just been a plethora of Davidson’s plum in the Masterchef kitchen all out of sudden #MasterChefAU — Michael Schumacher (@schumacherfed) July 12, 2020</p>
<p>Are these guys getting kickbacks from the Davidson plum suppliers? #MasterChefAU — Michelle 🐿💨 (@MichelleMackey1) July 12, 2020</p>
<p>Also, who at #MasterChefAU has shares in a Davidson’s plum farm? — Jo Printz (@JoPrintz) July 12, 2020</p>
<p>Given most of us are probably more familiar with your common garden variety plum, what is the Davidson variety?</p>
<p>Firstly, it’s not actually a plum. Like much Australian native fruit, its modern name is inspired by the European fruit it most resembled despite the connection being mostly visual.</p>
<p>It’s actually a member of the cunoniaceae family of plants mostly found in the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>A luscious purple skin reveals a deep red juicy pulp. But you may not want to bite right in as Davidson plums have a rather tart taste with a slight bitterness. As such they are usually used in sauces, jams and cakes or even as a relish on meats.</p>

<p>RELATED: MasterChef star slams ‘frustrating’ judge</p>
<p>Its preponderance in MasterChef is not entirely a surprise. Native ingredients have all featured strongly this season.</p>
<p>Lemon myrtle, saltbush and wattle seeds have been liberally infused in oils, added to crumbs and whipped up into ice creams by contestants. But the Davidson plum could lay claim to being the native “hero” of MasterChef 2020.</p>
<p>Callum’s Davidson plum dish was almost his undoing with the South Australian showering his plate with unnecessary elements in an effort to “elevate” his dish and make it restaurant quality.</p>
<p>But at least he tried, seemed the judges’ view, who thought Reece’s offering was underwhelming and too simple.</p>
<p>Jock Zonfrillo damned his beetroot and goats cheese starter with faint praise declaring it “just nice”.</p>
<p>“Reece your portions were just not quite right, your seasoning was out, and we all felt it just wasn’t finals worthy.”</p>
<p>And with that damning critique, Reece left the kitchen. He probably should have added a Davidson plum to his plate.

<h3 id="fans-are-calling-out-the-masterchef-judges-for-being-too-negative-with-their-mid-cook-critiques">&ldquo;Fans Are Calling Out the MasterChef Judges For Being Too Negative With Their Mid-Cook Critiques&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/Q2Gni3XxfeOKzBdhntXryFi0TLc/0x440:6000x3590/fit-in/1200x630/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2020/07/14/163/n/4852708/72ff3e825f0d1ec9733fe1.09676331_.jpg" alt="img">
Over the last two episodes especially, fans have loudly called out the MasterChef judges for perceived differences in the ways they encourage and criticise contestants mid-challenge.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Jock Zonfrillo and Andy Allen called Reece Hignell&rsquo;s beetroot and goat&rsquo;s cheese entree &ldquo;very safe&rdquo;. When Melissa Leongspoke to Laura Sharrad about her similarly classic meat dish of lamb, mint and peas, she asked a question with a more positive slant: &ldquo;What will make your dish exceptional?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, Jock approached Laura and asked if she was nervous because she had &ldquo;nowhere to hide&rdquo; with her dish. &ldquo;This could be your last cook,&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;Nah, it&rsquo;s not going to be. I can&rsquo;t have negativity, otherwise I&rsquo;ll crumble,&rdquo; Laura replied.</p>
<p>When POPSUGAR Australia asked Reece about the accusation that the critiques were &ldquo;unfair&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;I think they just have a way of communicating with everyone and they choose how they do that,&rdquo; before adding that he simply wished he&rsquo;d stuck to his instincts on the day.</p>
<p>Then, on last night&rsquo;s Mystery Box episode, Emelia Jackson explained her choux pastry with rhubarb and strawberries, and Andy just asked: &ldquo;What if this choux fails?&rdquo; in an attempt to put her off.</p>
<p>Andy and Jock then seemed dismissive of Callum Hann&rsquo;s inventive dish of bay leaf ice cream, with a bay leaf and rhubarb granita, strawberry Pimms consommé, strawberry jam mousse, and frozen rhubarb and paprika meringue. As Callum explained his dish, their expressions were quizzical and skeptical, with Andy going so far as to taste both the bay leaf ice cream and paprika and frozen rhubarb meringue. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely something that I&rsquo;ve never had before,&rdquo; Andy said, giving very little away.</p>
<p>Talking to Laura who was cooking with fish and cabbage, Melissa called her dish &ldquo;resourceful&rdquo;, but posed the question: &ldquo;Is fish and veg enough to get you into the Semi-Final?&rdquo; Then, to Reynold Poernomo, she talked about how &ldquo;excited&rdquo; she was to try his spin on a savoury Japanese custard, chawanmushi. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s the best, you&rsquo;re in the Semis,&rdquo; she said as she walked away.</p>
<p>The difference between the types of critique seems to be between encouraging and motivating contestants to push themselves in the competition, or instead trying to foster in them feelings of self-doubt. While MasterChef is partly a mental game, as well as one of culinary skill, it can be uncomfortable to watch the language from the judges during the cooks diverge so much — and seem to impact the contestants so heavily.</p>
<p>Even though the contestants may not be unhappy about the difference between these styles of critique, people at home have definitely been disappointed by the perceived negativity:
