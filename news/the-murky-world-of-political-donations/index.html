<p>Despite everything – the MPs’ expenses scandal of 2009, Neil Hamilton and “cash for questions”, perennial allegations about the “sale” of honours, Brexit referendum irregularities – British political life remains remarkably clean by international and historical standards. Corruption, or anything remotely resembling it, is the exception rather than the rule. That is why the current media allegations about a decision made by Robert Jenrick, the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, are so serious.</p>
<p>It is important to add at this point that there is no suggestion that Mr Jenrick broke any law or made any personal gain. The issue is about how it came to be that Mr Jenrick approved a highly lucrative housing development in the London docklands by the businessman Richard Desmond shortly (a fortnight) before Mr Desmond donated £12,000 to the Conservative party. The development was opposed by the local authority, Tower Hamlets, but their objections were overruled by Mr Jenrick, and approval was given one day before Mr Desmond would have had to pay a development levy to the council – of between £30m and £50m. Altogether the value of the deal is around £1bn.</p>
<p>In this case, the matter is complicated because the council mounted a court appeal and Mr Jenrick accepted that his ruling had been “unlawful by reason of apparent bias”, quashed it, and will not take further part in the proceedings.

<h3 id="neil-hamilton-disgraced-mp-to-z-list-celebrity-to-political-comeback">&ldquo;Neil Hamilton: disgraced MP to Z-list celebrity to political comeback&rdquo;</h3>

The former Tory is unexpectedly back, leading Ukip in the Welsh assembly. Here’s a summary of his career highs and lows</p>
<p>Younger citizens may not have heard of Neil Hamilton, who has made a triumphant return with Ukip to the Welsh assembly after 20 years in the political wilderness.</p>
<p>Not only has he been elected as one of seven Ukip assembly members via the regional list system, he has been appointed “group leader”, beating the head of the party in Wales, Nathan Gill. Gill remains Welsh leader of Ukip because that role is directly appointed by Nigel Farage, the party’s UK chief. This in no way sounds awkward.</p>
<p>Hamilton told ITV Morning Britain he had strong ties with the country. “Cut me open, I’d be like a stick of Blackpool Rock,” he said, momentarily forgetting that Blackpool is not in Wales.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick reminder of some of Hamilton’s career highlights, in case you were lucky enough to have missed them first time round.</p>
<p>He was a Tory whip in the 1980s</p>
<p>Hamilton became MP for Tatton in 1983, after failing to secure Bradford North in 1979. He served as a government whip under Margaret Thatcher, before becoming corporate affairs minister under John Major. Hamilton’s views and policies – anti-Europe, pro-privatisation, anti-trade unions, and pro-smoking – haven’t changed too much since.</p>
<p>He wanted to shut down the coal mines</p>
<p>Hamilton’s roots may have been in coal mining – both his grandfathers were south Wales miners – but he was part of the Thatcher government that went to war with the industry and its unions. “Britain couldn’t continue being an industrial museum for ever,” he explained more recently.</p>
<p>He opposed the removal of lead from petrol</p>
<p>Hamilton wasn’t too impressed at the medical and environmental evidence on unleaded petrol, telling parliament as recently as 1999 there was “no evidence that lead in petrol poses any health risk”.</p>
<p>A liar and a cheat</p>

<p>Hamilton’s political downfall came in 1996, after the Guardian reported he had taken money in brown envelopes from Mohamed Al Fayed in the “cash-for-questions” scandal. His libel suit against the paper collapsed, leading to this infamous headline and his resignation from government. He went on to lose his Tatton seat to journalist Martin Bell in 1997’s general election.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Tatton’s MP is George Osborne, the chancellor.</p>
<p>He was the subject of a Louis Theroux documentary</p>
<p>In 2001, Hamilton was considered weird enough to justify a Louis Theroux documentary, appearing alongside his wife, Christine. The couple used the programme to relaunch themselves as media stars and it’s still compelling viewing, particularly Christine Hamilton’s flirt scene, and Neil’s House of Cards (original version) quoting response. The Hamiltons’ friends in the Tory press weren’t too impressed, but the couple seemed to know what they were doing. While Neil’s political career was in the wilderness, he had a new plan.</p>
<p>He becomes an all-purpose Z-list celebrity</p>

<p>It’s difficult to imagine now, but the Hamiltons became archtypes for a new kind of celebrity: famous for being famous, the initial context of their fame (public scandal and humiliation) seemed forgotten in an endless round of shameless PR appearances.</p>
<p>He danced for Johnny Vegas’s fish</p>
<p>But suckling from the teat of media fame is a game of ever-descreasing circles, and tends to end one way: in a perspex cage being showered with fish while Johnny Vegas shouts: “You sicken me!”</p>
<p>He joins Ukip</p>
<p>After first appearing on a Ukip stage in 2011, eyebrows were raised when Hamilton was given important roles within the party, rising to the role of campaigns director. He was demoted from the role in 2014.</p>

<p>And then gets voted in as the leader of their Welsh assembly group. Happy now?</p>

<h3 id="frank-rich-the-folly-of-trumps-bolton-lawsuit">&ldquo;Frank Rich: The Folly of Trump’s Bolton Lawsuit&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6b4/d72/38c2c405e976724cbfbbc29a5d0fdd528a-john-bolton-2.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg" alt="img">
Is he really worth the trouble? Photo: Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images</p>
<p>Most weeks, New York Magazine writer-at-large Frank Rich speaks with contributor Alex Carp about the biggest stories in politics and culture. Today, John Bolton’s memoir, Neil Gorsuch’s surprise decision, and #Rampgate at West Point.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has sued John Bolton in an attempt to stop his upcoming memoir, despite its publisher having already printed and distributed copies. If the book is, effectively, already out, what is the point of the lawsuit?</p>
<p>This is something of a mystery. While the White House staff is down to C- and D-list toadies in year four, surely at least some of them knew that this lawsuit was a terrible idea for Trump, just on selfish political grounds. Bolton’s book was past the point of being recalled when Bill Barr’s Justice Department made its doomed move, Bolton had already taped an ABC interview about the juicy parts, and the Wall Street Journal was publishing an excerpt. Whether as a matter of First Amendment law or just plain common sense, there was no way Trump could suppress this book. So what was the point? The only visible result has been to give Bolton an even larger megaphone.</p>
<p>The wise move for Trump, of course, would have been to simply ignore the book altogether. But clearly he didn’t listen to any such counsel, even if one of his bunker mates had the guts to offer it to him. As a consequence, Bolton has a huge audience for a key revelation that destroys one of the central planks of Trump’s reelection campaign — that China foisted the coronavirus on America and that Joe Biden is somehow China’s corrupt accomplice in evil, #BeijingBiden. It’s hard to keep making that case — which was preposterous to start with — when Bolton has revealed in graphic detail that Trump was kissing President Xi Jinping’s ass, “pleading” with him for a trade deal in a quid pro quo intended to boost Trump’s reelection prospects.</p>
<p>One other possible result of Trump’s legal action may also be salutary — the potential for his suit to claw back Bolton’s royalties even while failing to kill the book itself. An author who chose the title The Room Where It Happened was clearly counting on a Hamilton-scale payday. But a man who has betrayed his country on Bolton’s scale — from hawking the fictional Bush administration intelligence to justify the disastrous invasion of Iraq to staying silent about presidential criminality during impeachment — deserves nothing but contempt.</p>
<p>In any event, most of the reported contents of his book either confirm or fill in additional details of what we already know. We certainly don’t need Bolton to tell us that Mike Pompeo thinks Trump is “so full of shit,” which is not only self-evidently true but also a naked instance of psychological projection by Pompeo, who is doing his best to go down in history as America’s worst secretary of State. So familiar is much of Bolton’s brief against Trump that it’s amazing Trump still thinks he can cover it up — whether with lawsuits, lies, Twitter trolling, or counterprogramming.</p>
<p>Which leads me to wonder if the pointless but rowdy legal action against Bolton may have another purpose entirely: to distract from and drown out an arguably more pressing reality that Trump wants to cover up — the surge of COVID-19 cases in (mostly) red states. On a parallel track to the Bolton fracas, both Trump and Mike Pence have been engaged in a campaign to falsify and downplay news of the pandemic, as if they were locked in a primary race to be the mayor from Jaws. Though in this case the jurisdiction is not Martha’s Vineyard but Tulsa, where 19,000 Trumpists have already started lining up to pack into a hall for Saturday night’s rally.</p>
<p>So what if these MAGA-ites have to agree to a waiver relieving the Trump campaign of liability should they get ill? So what if Tulsa’s own chief health official has said there’s a “huge risk factor” in attending? So what if masks aren’t required? No worries. This week Trump has said the coronavirus will go away without a vaccine (even as he falsely promises a vaccine imminently). Pence has said projections of a “second wave” of the coronavirus are “overblown” by the media. (The sidelined Anthony Fauci says we’re still in the first wave.) Both men, as well as their political and media allies, are dismissing the rise in cases as simply the result of the rise in testing (false) and attributing the new outbreaks mainly to nursing homes, prisons, and meat-packing plants (tell that to the infected barflies of Florida). When Tulsa reported its highest number of new COVID cases to date yesterday, the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, took it as her cue to say the rally offered “a safe opportunity to congregate” and Trump went on Hannity to declare that the virus is “fading away.”</p>
<p>Though the White House doesn’t seem to know or care, there is one crucial distinction between lying about the revelations in John Bolton’s book and lying about a pandemic. With the pandemic, all Americans are in the room where it happens and will see for themselves if it does. Either those 19,000 rally attendees in Tulsa will remain healthy in the weeks to come — or they will get sick and in some cases die. Period.</p>
<p>In the wake of this week’s Supreme Court decision expanding federal workplace protections to gay and transgender people, some conservatives and Evangelicals have come to criticize its lead author, Neil Gorsuch, and argue that his turn away from conservative orthodoxy will keep Trump voters home in 2020. Are they right?</p>
<p>If Evangelical voters and their leaders had the humanity and Christian values they claim, you’d think that today’s surprise Roberts Court decision, protecting some 700,000 young immigrants from Trump and Stephen Miller’s cruel scheme to deport them en masse, would balance out their rage at the long-overdue decision upholding LGBTQ rights. But you would be wrong. Now, as always, these voters threaten to quit the GOP whenever they find Republicans’ actions insufficiently homophobic or misogynistic for their tastes, and always try to cloak their protest as a battle for “religious freedom.” (“Religious freedom” was the same dodge adopted by an earlier generation of right-wing religious and political demagogues who argued against desegregation.)</p>
<p>But the threats are empty. As recently as 2015, Franklin Graham was thundering about leaving the GOP in protest over the funding of Planned Parenthood and “wasteful spending.” Today, he’s among the most vocal of Trump backers in the land, even endorsing the sacrilegious Bible photo op in front of St. John’s Church.</p>
<p>According to Henry Olsen of the Washington Post, it wouldn’t take many defections to put Trump in jeopardy. “Even a small reduction in the Republican margin among the devout will destroy any hope Trump will be reelected,” he writes. In Olsen’s number crunching of 2016 and 2018 voting patterns, Trump’s margin among Evangelical voters would need to fall only ten points in November for him to lose Florida and North Carolina and possibly Georgia and Texas.</p>
<p>But I wouldn’t waste any prayers on that. I’d guess that if Trump does lose, it won’t be because these voters bolt. All you need to know about this constituency is that Roy Moore, an accused serial pedophile, received more than 80 percent of the Christian conservative vote in the 2017 Alabama Senate race — almost identical to Trump’s share of the white Evangelical vote, the Access Hollywood tape notwithstanding, in 2016.</p>
<p>President Trump seemed to have trouble bringing a glass to his mouth and walking down a ramp during a visit to West Point last weekend, drawing attention to his health. What do you think is going on?</p>
<p>You don’t have to be a doctor, or know the specific diagnosis, to recognize Trump’s continued physical and mental decline. About the only people who don’t seem to know are his own handlers, who did nothing to protect him from the spectacle of his doddering down the ramp on-camera at West Point.</p>
<p>Once again, much as with his hyping of the Bolton book, Trump went out of his way to advertise his own scandal — this time, by sending forth another one of those ludicrous tweets claiming that what you can see with your own eyes on video isn’t what actually happened. And once again, he dismantled a pillar of his own reelection campaign. You can’t go around calling your opponent “Sleepy Joe” and smearing his mental and physical capabilities when you lack the ability to pick up a glass of water with one hand.

<h3 id="what-books-do-our-senedd-members-have-on-their-shelves--and-what-do-they-say-about-them">&ldquo;What books do our Senedd Members have on their shelves – and what do they say about them?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.nation.cymru/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/16094834/virtual-senedd-books-1.jpg" alt="img">
One of the more inconsequential, but nonetheless fascinating, political phenomenons of the lockdown has been the opportunity to sneak a peek at the bookshelves of our elected representatives.</p>
<p>Many of us have passed the time by zooming into blurry screenshots of politicians being interviewed at home to get a behind-the-scenes look at their intellectual inspirations or guilty pleasures.</p>
<p>One suspects there has been careful pruning of collections as politicians seek to convey the Ron Burgundy effect – as the Anchorman central character famously said: “I’m very important. I have many leather-bound books and my apartment smells of rich mahogany.”</p>
<p>Such is the growing significance placed on the personal libraries of our lawmakers, the aptly named ‘Bookshelf Credibility’ Twitter account now has the same number of followers as the First Minister.</p>
<p>And the trend sparked its first real scandal last week when Sarah Vine posted a photo of one of her 20 bookshelves, which included a book by white supremacist and Holocaust denier David Irving. Vine is married to defacto deputy Prime Minister, Michael Gove.</p>
<p>Against this background, one brave MS, Hefin David, volunteered some close-ups of his bookshelves for public inspection. A couple of Bond novels and a Roald Dahl popping out from between the memoirs and essays the only signs of distraction from politics.</p>
<p>Insight</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Senedd’s expenses database gives details of dozens of titles bought by members since 2013, as books can be bought by MSs under their office costs allowance.</p>
<p>Many are dictionaries and handbooks but Nation.Cymru dived into the database to find some of the more interesting and sometimes surprisingly selections.</p>
<p>Dafydd Elis Thomas has used his allowance to buy such titles as Rainforests of Great Britain and Ireland, Around Wales by B-roads and Slate Quarry Railways of Gwynedd.</p>
<p>Throw in the two walking maps he bought for £19.94 and you would think he was planning a holiday if it weren’t for the fact he has been Culture, Sport and Tourism Minister since quitting Plaid Cymru to join the Government in 2017.</p>
<p>The list also gives insights into research done by politicians on controversial issues. In February 2017, UKIP’s Neil Hamilton supported parents in Carmarthenshire trying to stop a school moving to Welsh-medium teaching.</p>
<p>That month he bought a 1985 book on Aspects of Bilingualism in Wales which, contrary to his position, “points to the crucial nature of immersion” in saving the language. More recently Hamilton purchased The Welsh Language – A History.</p>
<p>His former UKIP colleague, Gareth Bennett, also brushed up on his Welsh history when he first entered the Senedd, purchasing Martin Shipton’s book on the first decade of the Senedd, Poor Man’s Parliament.</p>
<p>At the same time, he bought a book called For Wales, see England: Language, Nationhood and Identity. If the title seems like a surprising choice for a former UKIP group leader, the fact that the author is a former UKIP parliamentary candidate is important context.</p>

<p>When it comes to the economy, the now deputy economy minister Lee Waters purchased The Entrepreneurial State by Mariana Mazzucato shortly after being elected. The book, which “debunks the myth of a lumbering, bureaucratic state versus a dynamic, innovative private sector”, was required reading for those on the left at the time after its author was made a member of Jeremy Corbyn’s economic advisory committee.</p>
<p>After being appointed as Plaid’s shadow economy minister in October 2018, Ynys Mon MS Rhun ap Iorwerth got on top of his brief by buying six books the following month ranging from the rather dry sounding Microeconomics to popular economy reads such as The Great Economists: How Their Idea Can Help us Today and the unfortunately relevant: The Truth About Markets: Why Some Nations are Rich but Most Remain Poor.</p>
<p>Most recently, it’s no surprise that Brexit has been dominating the reading lists of MSs. Labour’s Alun Davies bought Rule Britannia: Brexit and the End of the Empire and Beyond Brexit: Towards a British Constitution, while former first minister Carwyn Jones, ever the lawyer, has been studying the scholarly Constitutional and Administrative Law.</p>
<p>It will come as no surprise to Bay watchers that David Melding has been reading up about all things constitutional since 2013 when he ordered the now naïve sounding The Passage to Europe: How a Continent Became a Union, along with books on the Scottish independence referendum.</p>
<p>Overall, MSs have spent £1,287.06 of allowances on books in this term, with Dafydd Elis-Thomas emerging as the Senedd bookworm. No excuse then for any of them to appear on our screens in front of empty shelves.

<p>What would the fiercely articulate writer James Baldwin have made of the world today? Sadly the great man died of stomach cancer aged just 63 in 1987, but this film, made in 2016, shows how his thinking remains powerful, precise, poetic and relevant. Told entirely in Baldwin’s words and using the text (read by Samuel L Jackson) of his final unfinished book project, Remember This House, Raoul Peck’s Oscar-nominated film follows Baldwin’s history of the black experience in America, from ghastly media stereotypes to scenes of police brutality that today feel horribly familiar. Baldwin only completed 30 pages of his final book,

<h3 id="retired-navy-captain-cpo-plead-guilty-to-bribery-charges-in-latest-fat-leonard-development">&ldquo;Retired Navy Captain, CPO Plead Guilty to Bribery Charges in Latest ‘Fat Leonard’ Development&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://news.usni.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/HT_leonard_francis_02_jef_150116_16x9_992.jpg" alt="img">
SAN DIEGO, Calif. – A retired Navy captain who collected nearly $91,000 in favors for sharing classified U.S. 7th Fleet ship schedules and steering logistics contracts to a foreign defense firm will plead guilty, according to federal court records. The plea marks the latest conviction in the Glenn Defense Marine Asia corruption investigation.</p>
<p>Retired Capt. David Williams Haas, who served as 7th Fleet’s operations officer on its flagship USS Blue Ridge (LCC-19) from August 2011 to July 2013, was indicted in 2018 on eight counts: one count of conspiracy to commit bribery, six counts of bribery and one count of conspiracy to commit honest fraud. The federal grand jury alleged Haas had collected bribes, including cash, in 2011 and 2012, and had accepted pricey hotel stays, dinners, parties and prostitute services provided to him and others Navy officials from Leonard Glenn Francis in exchange for getting lucrative ship-husbanding contracts steered to Glenn’s firm, Glenn Defense Marine Asia.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Haas pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit bribery, a felony charge that could net him up to five years in prison and up to $250,000 fine, according to court records. He also agreed to pay restitution to the government of $90,968.82.</p>
<p>Also this week, retired Chief Petty Officer Brooks Alonzo Parks, who was indicted along with Haas in August 2018, agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bribery, according to court records. His sentencing hearing is set for Aug. 28. Parks originally was indicted on a single count of conspiracy to commit “honest fraud” services. A superseding indictment issued in June 2019 charged him with additional offenses of one count of conspiracy to commit bribery and four counts of bribery.</p>
<p>Parks, who retired in 2016, had worked at Afloat Training Group Western Pacific from 2008 to 2013. From 2005 to 2008 he was 7th Fleet’s logistics lead petty officer, a job that included managing parts of the logistics budget and signing and processing invoices, according to federal indictments filed in U.S. District Court in San Diego.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District, Robert S. Brewer, signed both plea agreements that were submitted to the court and will be reviewed by a federal magistrate judge who will oversee the sentencing hearings.</p>
<p>Both guilty pleas come two years after Haas and Parks were indicted. But it’s been nearly seven years since the first indictments and arrests in a federal investigation into a wide-ranging favors-for-contracts scandal that’s ensnared senior flag officers and commanders, logistics specialists, and a Naval Criminal Investigation Service agent.</p>
<p>The latest plea deals submitted to the court admit a number of illicit solicitations and acceptance of favors that GDMA provided as part of the conspiracy to steer 7th Fleet contracts to the Singapore-based company starting in 2004 and continuing until 2013, when senior GDMA executives were indicted. While husbanding firms compete for U.S. Navy ship visits to foreign ports, GDMA executives sought to skew the process in its favor by getting insider information – some of it classified – from a wide range of Navy officials in return for various types of bribes and favors.</p>
<p>In one case, illegal solicitations for favors led to events such as the “Cinderella Liberty” weekend in May 2012, when Francis paid for rooms at the luxury Shangri-La Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia, for Haas and others, according to the plea agreement, dated June 9, 2020, and submitted to the court. “Festivities included dinner, entertainment at a night club, alcohol, and the services of prostitutes in a hotel suite where Haas was present,” according to the plea agreement that federal prosecutors submitted to the court.</p>
<p>In June 2012, “Francis paid for a two-day party for Haas and others, including transportation, dinner at Nobu Restaurant, and entertainment at several hostess clubs where the services of prostitutes were provided, all at a total cost of about $75,000,” the document stated.</p>
<p>Two months later, the Navy approved a port visit by the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74) to Sepangar, Malaysia, after the service initially had opposed it, according to the document. Francis later thanked Haas and others by emails, and GDMA “ultimately billed the U.S. Navy $2.7 million for this port visit.”</p>
<p>Haas, in the plea agreement, admitted to collecting bribes valued at $90,968.82 from GDMA.</p>
<p>In November 2012, Francis had sent Haas “numerous internal U.S. Navy documents that (he) had illegally received” and asked him to intervene for him “to fight accusations that GDMA had dumped untreated sewage in Subic Bay, Philippines,” according to the plea deal. After Haas sent various news articles about the incident to other 7th Fleet officials, Francis responded by email at one point that “this is headed in the right direction.”</p>
<p>But three months later, Francis’ long-running and lucrative bribes-for-contracts arrangement, which included contracting assurances, false billings, over-inflated invoices for husbanding services, was nearing its end.</p>
<p>Navy officials traveled to Thailand in February 2013 “to investigate allegations of fraudulent over-billing by GDMA related to the purported port authority Laem Thong East,” Haas’ plea agreement stated. “When presented with mounting documentary evidence of GDMA’s over-billing, Haas wrote to a conspirator: ‘This is getting hard.’”</p>
<p>While Haas had conspired with Francis closer to the end of Francis’ reign, Parks had been involved in the scheme from the start, according to the plea agreement.</p>
<p>“GDMA’s main business involved the ‘husbanding’ of marine vessels, a service it had provided across the Seventh Fleet’s area of responsibility under various contracts with the U.S. Navy for over 25 years,” federal prosecutors stated in Parks’ plea agreement.</p>
<p>Starting in “early 2006 and continuing into 2010,” the agreement stated, Parks conspired with GDMA and agreed to commit bribery and “would demand, seek, receive, and accept things of value from Francis and others, including gifts, transportation, hotel expenses, and airline tickets.”</p>
<p>Parks admitted to several bribes.</p>
<p>In June 2006, Parks wrote to Francis asking for a hotel suite reservation and, in an email, wrote, “It feels good living like a KING on an E-6’s salary!!”</p>
<p>In three separate times in early 2007, Parks asked GDMA for hotel reservations in Hong Kong, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur that cost more than $3,000 each. At one point, emails between GDMA executives wrote of Parks, “what is he doing for us and can we make any money out of him?” In March 2007, after GDMA officials had sought his help to get the Navy to pay for an invoice, Neil Peterson, GDMA’s vice president of global operations, wrote: “Finally he’s doing something good for us!!… We will make good use of him since he’s going to be onboard until 2009!!”</p>
<p>In early June 2007, Parks had sent Peterson the itinerary for the Blue Ridge‘s supply officer, who was to travel to the Philippines just as another company vied for the husbanding contract to support another ship’s visit to Cebu. Peterson received the competitor’s information from Parks and forwarded it to Francis, writing “Looks like Parks pulled through for us again… haha.”</p>
<p>For several years, Parks continued to share sensitive, proprietary information about ships’ schedules and competitor pricing data and invoices to GDMA executives, including the port visit schedules for the guided-missile destroyers USS Paul Hamilton (DDG-60) and USS Stethem (DDG-63). Parks admitted to getting bribes worth $25,405 from GDMA. He has agreed to pay the U.S. Navy $25,405 in restitution.</p>
<p>Francis was arrested and charged in September 2013 by the federal prosecutors in San Diego, which have the lead in pursuing more than three dozen cases involving Navy officials and GDMA executives. In January 2015, he waived indictment and agreed to plead guilty to three counts: conspiracy to commit bribery; bribery; and conspiracy to defraud the United States.</p>
<p>Francis, who reportedly has suffered from poor health, has remained in U.S. federal custody as his sentencing hearings have been postponed and rescheduled several times. In December, the federal judge overseeing his case set his sentencing for March 26, 2021.
