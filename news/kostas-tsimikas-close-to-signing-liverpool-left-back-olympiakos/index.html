<p>Liverpool are close to signing Olympiakos left-back Kostas Tsimikas for an £11.75m fee.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old has been one of the Greek side&rsquo;s star performers this season as they stormed to their 45th Greek Super League title and were knocked out of the Europa League round-of-16 by Wolves.</p>
<p>Liverpool moved for Tsimikas after they were unable to agree a fee with Norwich City for Jamal Lewis in their pursuit of a deputy for Andy Robertson.</p>
<p>Tsimikas (r) was knocked out of the Europa League round of 16 by Wolves this week</p>
<p>Norwich wanted £20m, whereas Liverpool valued Lewis at closer to £10m.</p>
<p>Liverpool have been watching Tsimikas for a long time, as they believe he has the quality to develop into a world-class defender and also thinks he represents great value in the current economic climate.</p>
<p>The player is expected to fly to the UK as soon as possible for a medical and to discuss personal terms.</p>
<p>Sky Sports News&rsquo; Kaveh Solhekol from The Insider column&hellip;</p>
<p>Pedro Chirivella played only six times for Liverpool before his contract ran out in June. He may not have established himself at Anfield but he did play a part in the deal.</p>
<p>Feel for Jamal Lewis. Liverpool wanted him but Norwich wouldn&rsquo;t sell for less than £20m so they&rsquo;re signing Kostas Tsimikas from Olympiacos instead for £11m. Liverpool sticking to sensible budget this summer. They&rsquo;ve been watching Tsimikas for three years — Kaveh Solhekol (@SkyKaveh) August 9, 2020</p>
<p>Liverpool first came across Tsimikas in 2017/18 when he was on loan at Dutch club Willem II at the same time as Chirivella. They have been watching Tsimikas closely ever since and scouting reports and data suggest he has what it takes to be more than just a back up for first-choice left back Andy Robertson.</p>
<p>Tsimikas and Chirivella spent a season playing together at Willem II. Next season Tsimikas will be playing for Liverpool while Chirivella has signed for Nantes.</p>

<h3 id="kaveh-solhekol-the-insider-jadon-sancho-kai-havertz-waiting-for-man-utd-and-chelsea-offers">&ldquo;Kaveh Solhekol, The Insider: Jadon Sancho, Kai Havertz waiting for Man Utd and Chelsea offers&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://e0.365dm.com/20/08/1600x900/skysports-sancho-bvb-man-utd_5063424.jpg" alt="img">
Manchester United remain unhappy with Borussia Dortmund&rsquo;s asking price for Jadon Sancho</p>
<p>The two biggest transfers of this summer are likely to be players moving to the Premier League from the Bundesliga: Jadon Sancho wants to leave Borussia Dortmund for Manchester United and Kai Havertz wants to swap Bayer Leverkusen for Chelsea.</p>
<p>Both players will get their wish as long as United and Chelsea pay the asking prices. Dortmund want €120m (£108m) for Sancho and Leverkusen want €100m (£90m) for Havertz.</p>
<p>Borussia Dortmund will be playing Champions League football next season but that&rsquo;s not enough to convince Sancho that he should stay.</p>
<p>He wants to move to United and United may never be in a stronger position to sign him. The coronavirus pandemic means that the other big clubs who wanted to sign Sancho are simply not in a position to make a move for him in the current economic climate.</p>
<p>Download the Transfer Talk Podcast on: Apple | Spreaker</p>
<p>United have let it be known that they are not willing to pay the £108m asking price which has bemused Dortmund because they have not been told what United are willing to pay.</p>
<p>As one agent put it, you don&rsquo;t buy a house by telling the owner what you&rsquo;re not going to pay.</p>
<p>Dortmund are flying to their preseason training camp on Monday and they are expecting Sancho to be there. They wanted Sancho&rsquo;s future sorted out by today, but there has so far been no bid from United.</p>
<p>Kai Havertz is keen to complete a move to Chelsea</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a different story for what concerns Bayer Leverkusen and Kai Havertz. Of the two players, he is the one who is most keen to move as soon as possible. He has been agitating behind the scenes for a move to Chelsea and Leverkusen are prepared to let him go as soon as they finish their Europa League campaign.</p>
<p>Chelsea are prepared to spend big this summer but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they will pay the £90m asking price. Leverkusen are talking tough in public with their sporting director claiming that Havertz will stay unless their valuation is met.</p>
<p>That is a standard tactic in these kind of situations. After all, you would hardly expect Rudi Voller to come out and say they are prepared to negotiate and give Chelsea a good deal.</p>
<p>Voller was a great striker and he&rsquo;s a pretty good salesman as well. Despite the fact that the likes of Michael Ballack, Toni Kroos and Bernd Schuster have played for Leverkusen, Voller says Havertz is the club&rsquo;s greatest ever player.</p>
<p>If Chelsea want Havertz as much as he wants them then the deal will be done after Leverkusen&rsquo;s interest in the Europa League ends. That could happen on Monday if they lose to Inter Milan.</p>
<p>Havertz has only two years left on his contract so this is the perfect time for Leverkusen to cash in especially because they won&rsquo;t be in the Champions League next season unless they qualify by winning the Europa League.</p>
<p>Traore in demand</p>
<p>Bertrand Traore scored 21 goals for Lyon since joining from Chelsea in 2017</p>
<p>Lyon are prepared to sell former Chelsea winger Bertrand Traore this summer and he has been watched by a long list of Premier League clubs including Newcastle United, Leicester City, Everton and Crystal Palace.</p>
<p>Lyon paid Chelsea £9m for Traore three years ago after he had impressed during loan spells at Vitesse Arnhem and Ajax.</p>
<p>Why Liverpool went for Tsimikas</p>
<p>Kostas Tsimikas has been in impressive form for Olympiakos this season</p>
<p>Pedro Chirivella played only six times for Liverpool before his contract ran out in June. He may not have established himself at Anfield but he did play a part in Liverpool&rsquo;s imminent signing of Kostas Tsimikas from Olympiakos.</p>
<p>Liverpool first came across Tsimikas in 2017/18 when he was on loan at Dutch club Willem II at the same time as Chirivella. They have been watching Tsimikas closely ever since and scouting reports and data suggest he has what it takes to be more than just a back up for first-choice left back Andy Robertson.</p>
<p>Tsimikas and Chirivella spent a season playing together at Willem II. Next season Tsimikas will be playing for Liverpool while Chirivella has signed for Nantes.</p>
<p>Bizot cleaning up</p>
<p>AZ goalkeeper Marco Bizot enjoyed an impressive season</p>
<p>Marco Bizot has gained a reputation as one of the best goalkeepers in Holland and he hit the headlines last season after keeping 24 clean sheets in 38 games at AZ Alkmaar.</p>
<p>Atletico Madrid, Sevilla and Valencia all want to sign him and we are told there has been interest as well from Sheffield United, Crystal Palace and Fulham.</p>
<p>Ronaldo going nowhere</p>
<p>Cristiano Ronaldo couldn&rsquo;t prevent Juventus&rsquo; Champions League exit</p>
<p>Nobody looked more upset than Cristiano Ronaldo when Juventus were knocked out of the Champions League by Lyon on Friday.</p>
<p>His two goals in a 2-1 victory weren&rsquo;t enough to prevent Juventus from going out on away goals in the competition which means the most to him.</p>
<p>That has led to talk that Paris Saint-Germain may try to sign him this summer, but Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli has ruled out Ronaldo leaving this summer. He has two years left on his contract and Agnelli says Ronaldo is &ldquo;a pillar&rdquo; of the club going forward.</p>
<p>We have to take Agnelli for his word so that means Juventus will have to find other ways to cut costs this summer.</p>
<p>Like every club, their finances have been hit by the pandemic and the quickest way to balance the books would have been to sell Ronaldo and get his wages off their payroll.</p>
<p>Pochettino on Juventus radar</p>
<p>Mauricio Pochettino was considered for the vacant Juventus job before the club appointed club icon Andrea Pirlo</p>
<p>Mauricio Pochettino was one of the names considered to replace Maurizio Sarri as Juventus manager and missing out this time doesn&rsquo;t mean he won&rsquo;t get a chance in the future.</p>
<p>His good work at Spurs has put him on a shortlist of names chairman Andrea Agnelli has drawn up of potential future managers.</p>
<p>He has made a big call by choosing Andrea Pirlo to replace Sarri. It should not be overlooked that Juventus have only had one foreign manager in 46 years - that was Didier Deschamps for one season in 2006/07 when they were in Serie B.</p>
<p>Eze&rsquo;s dream move</p>
<p>Ebere Eze scored 14 Championship goals this season</p>
<p>Ebere Eze will leave QPR this summer if one of the clubs who are interested in signing him offer £20m. He grew up supporting Arsenal and spent some time in their youth set up so his dream move would be to the Emirates Stadium. The days when Arsenal went shopping at QPR are long gone though.</p>
<p>The last time they signed someone from Rangers was 30 years ago when George Graham paid £1.3m for David Seaman. It was money well spent. Seaman won eight major trophies and was the No 1 for 13 seasons.</p>

Anthony Joshua welcomed a physical confrontation with Dillian Whyte</p>
<p>Dillian Whyte has promised a brutal response after Anthony Joshua threatened to &lsquo;give him a punch&rsquo; at the Alexander Povetkin fight.</p>
<p>Sky customers: Buy Whyte vs Povetkin</p>
<p>Non-Sky customers: Buy Whyte vs Povetkin</p>
<p>Whyte&rsquo;s status as the mandatory challenger for the WBC heavyweight title is at stake when he faces Povetkin on August 22, live on Sky Sports Box Office, and unified champion Joshua will be watching from ringside.</p>
<p>The British rivals became embroiled in a heated exchange in the aftermath of Whyte&rsquo;s explosive rematch win over Derek Chisora in December 2018, and Joshua is relishing the opportunity to resume their bitter feud.</p>
<p>Joshua clashed angrily with Whyte at The O2</p>
<p>BOOK NOW 🚨@DillianWhyte vs Alexander Povetkin and @KatieTaylor vs Delfine Persoon 2 in finale of #FightCamp on Aug 22, live on Sky Sports Box Office 🥊 — Sky Sports Boxing (@SkySportsBoxing) August 7, 2020</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might get in there and give him a punch as well,&rdquo; Joshua told Sky Sports. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting me psyched up now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Whyte has told Joshua to think again about stepping between the ropes at the finale of &lsquo;Fight Camp&rsquo; at Matchroom Boxing&rsquo;s Brentwood base.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might get a box, if he does that,&rdquo; Whyte told Sky Sports&rsquo; Toe 2 Toe podcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he does that, he might get a box, there and then, one box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks it&rsquo;s a game, but I don&rsquo;t play games with these guys. They think it&rsquo;s a game, scream and shout and get in each other&rsquo;s faces, but if he does, he will get a box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Asked if Joshua wants him to lose, Whyte said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know and I don&rsquo;t really care what he thinks or what he believes. I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s hard to say. He says one thing one day and the next day he says something else. There&rsquo;s no consistency with AJ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no consistency with him. He says this, then he says that. He just talks a lot of c**p. I&rsquo;m sick and tired of all these guys that&rsquo;s talking, talking, talking all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The WBC has confirmed the winner of Tyson Fury&rsquo;s third fight against Deontay Wilder must make a mandatory defence against Whyte next, with promoter Eddie Hearn even suggesting the Brixton man could replace the American as the next challenger.</p>
<p>But Povetkin, Russia&rsquo;s former WBA champion, stands in the way of Whyte&rsquo;s plans for huge British battles against Fury and Joshua.</p>
<p>Whyte said: &ldquo;Beat Povetkin then if Joshua wants to fight, we&rsquo;ll fight. If Fury wants to fight, we can fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only three or four big fights out there for me now after this one and I just want to have them.</p>
<p>Povetkin will attempt to ruin Whyte&rsquo;s world title ambitions</p>
<p>&ldquo;The biggest two is Joshua and Fury. If I beat them then I&rsquo;ve had an amazing career, and that&rsquo;s what I want to do.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="pga-collin-morikawas-stunning-finish-lands-maiden-major-at-harding-park">&ldquo;PGA: Collin Morikawa&rsquo;s stunning finish lands maiden major at Harding Park&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://e0.365dm.com/20/08/1600x900/skysports-collin-morikawa-golf_5063535.jpg" alt="img">
3:23 A look back at the best of the action from a thrilling final round at the PGA Championship A look back at the best of the action from a thrilling final round at the PGA Championship</p>
<p>Collin Morikawa fulfilled his rich promise and produced outstanding golf down the stretch to claim a two-shot win at the PGA Championship in only his second major start.</p>
<p>A thrilling final day at TPC Harding Park saw a remarkable number of players in contention, with seven players tied for the lead on 10 under par as the last pairing of Dustin Johnson and Scottie Scheffler entered the final third of the tournament.</p>
<p>Collin Morikawa chipped in for birdie at 14 and then eagled the 16th</p>
<p>But Morikawa broke free of the logjam when he chipped in for birdie at 14 and then drove the green at the par-four 16th to set up a timely eagle, before holding his nerve to negotiate the remaining two holes in par to complete a 64 - the joint-lowest round of the week - and become only the fourth player after Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy to lift the Wanamaker Trophy at the age of 23.</p>
<p>Paul Casey, 20 years Morikawa&rsquo;s senior, ended in a share of second with Johnson after closing with an excellent 66, while the biggest surprise of the final day was Brooks Koepka&rsquo;s bid for a historic third consecutive PGA win floundering as he stumbled to a 74 to finish 10 shots behind the champion.</p>
<p>1:25 Highlights from Morikawa&rsquo;s final-round 64 at the PGA Championship, securing him a two-shot victory and maiden major title Highlights from Morikawa&rsquo;s final-round 64 at the PGA Championship, securing him a two-shot victory and maiden major title</p>
<p>Ten years on from his heartbreak at Whistling Straits, overnight-leader Johnson looked favourite to double his major tally when he birdied the first and recovered from a three-putt bogey at the third with another birdie at the fourth before the putts dried up for the 2016 US Open winner.</p>
<p>Johnson had to dig deep to stay in the hunt as the volume of co-leaders continued to mount, with Casey, Scheffler, Tony Finau, Bryson DeChambeau, Cameron Champ, Jason Day, Matthew Wolff and Morikawa all enjoying spells at the top of the leaderboard.</p>
<p>Wolff, making his major debut, set a testing target in the clubhouse at 10 under when he birdied the last for a 65, and that score appeared to have a genuine chance of earning at least a place in a play-off until Morikawa took control of the tournament over the last five holes.</p>
<p>The recent Workday Charity Open winner made back-to-back birdies early on at the third and fourth and then holed a clutch 25-footer to save par at the sixth, and he followed another birdie at 10 with a sublime pitch-in for three at the 14th which lifted him to 11 under.</p>
<p>1:16 Paul Casey had no complaints after a strong week at the PGA Championship and led the plaudits for champion Morikawa Paul Casey had no complaints after a strong week at the PGA Championship and led the plaudits for champion Morikawa</p>
<p>Casey birdied 16 to join the American in the lead, but Morikawa then struck the defining shot of the championship at the same hole, a stunning drive on a bold line which pitched softly and hopped onto the green, rolling out to within seven feet of the flag.</p>
<p>Morikawa read the eagle putt to perfection and suddenly vaulted two clear of the pack, and Casey could not find the birdies he needed at 17 and 18 as the veteran Englishman had to settle for a share of second place - his 10th top-10 finish in his 64 major appearances.</p>
<p>Dustin Johnson had to settle for joint runner-up with Casey</p>
<p>Johnson effectively left himself too much to do when a poor drive at 14 led to his second bogey of the day, although he did well to limit the damage to a five with a gritty two-putt from close to 75 feet, and he required an eagle at 16 to have any hope of catching Morikawa.</p>
<p>A tugged drive and a penalty drop signalled the end of his chances, but he did lift his spirits when he pitched in from 50 yards to get back to 10 under and a birdie at the last capped a 68 and earned a place on the podium alongside Casey.</p>
<p>Brooks Koepka crashed out of contention with four bogeys on the front nine</p>
<p>Finau, DeChambeau and Day all signed for 66s to join Wolff on 10 under, while Scheffler&rsquo;s 68 got him into the five-way share of fourth ahead of Justin Rose, who bounced back from a double-bogey at the 13th with three birdies over the last four holes to post a 67 and finish on nine under.</p>
<p>Koepka had raised eyebrows with his bullish attitude on Saturday evening, when he made it abundantly clear he felt he was the man to beat, but his comments came back to haunt him as he followed a bogey at the second with three in a row from the seventh to take himself out of the running.</p>

<p>He would also bogey two of the last three to slump to three under alongside Tommy Fleetwood (73), with Rory McIlroy one further back after a 68, while Tiger Woods fired his best round of the championship, a 67, to ensure he would end the 102nd PGA Championship in red numbers.

<h3 id="willian-confirms-chelsea-exit-as-he-nears-arsenal-move">&ldquo;Willian confirms Chelsea exit as he nears Arsenal move&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://e0.365dm.com/20/08/1600x900/skysports-willian-chelsea_5063044.jpg" alt="img">
Willian scored nine goals and contributed seven assists in the 2019/20 Premier League season</p>
<p>Willian has confirmed he is leaving Chelsea, with Arsenal close to completing his signing on a three-year deal.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old leaves Stamford Bridge at the end of his contract after a seven-year spell, with Chelsea only willing to offer him a two-year deal rather than the player&rsquo;s desired three years.</p>
<p>He wrote an open letter to fans confirming his exit following Chelsea&rsquo;s defeat to Bayern in the last 16 of the Champions League.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were seven wonderful years. In August 2013 when I received the offer from Chelsea, I was convinced that this was where I had to play,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today I am certain that it was the best of decisions. There were so many happy times, some sad, there were trophies and it was always very intense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, beyond the trophies, I learnt a lot about myself. I developed a great deal, becoming a better player and a better person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With each training session, with each game, with every minute spent in the dressing room, I was always learning.</p>
<p>Willian&rsquo;s Chelsea PL ranking since debut in 2013</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am really grateful to the Chelsea fans for the affectionate way they welcomed me at Stamford Bridge and their support throughout my time at the club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was also criticism, which is normal, what is important though is that both the affection and criticism drove me to always give my all in every training session, every game, to be constantly improving until my very last minute in a Chelsea shirt!</p>
<p>1:43 Arsenal is the &lsquo;most likely destination&rsquo; for Willian if he fails to agree a new contract with Chelsea, according to Sky Sports News&rsquo; Kaveh Solhekol Arsenal is the &lsquo;most likely destination&rsquo; for Willian if he fails to agree a new contract with Chelsea, according to Sky Sports News&rsquo; Kaveh Solhekol</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time has now come to move on. I am certainly going to miss my team-mates. I will miss all the staff at the club who&rsquo;ve always treated me like a son and I will miss the fans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave with my head held high, safe in the knowledge that I won things here and always did my best in a Chelsea shirt!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heartfelt thanks go out to all of you and God bless you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arsenal in pole position to sign Willian</p>
<p>Arsenal moved into pole position to sign the Brazil international by offering a three-year contract earlier this week, and are on the verge of beating off competition from Barcelona and Inter Miami.</p>
<p>Along with the length of the deal, joining Mikel Arteta&rsquo;s rejuvenated side and the chance to work with fellow Brazilian Edu are the reasons Arsenal are favourites to secure Willian&rsquo;s signature.</p>
<p>Chelsea head coach Frank Lampard has insisted he will have no hard feelings if Willian leaves the club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It actually doesn&rsquo;t matter about disappointment from any party in this situation,&rdquo; said Lampard, ahead of Chelsea&rsquo;s Champions League tie against Bayern Munich on Saturday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got an answer for you (if Willian will leave) first and foremost, because Willian remains our player at the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In terms of being disappointed, certainly as a club I think we have done everything we can to explain to Willian, and mine and his relationship is really close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willian made 47 appearances for Chelsea in all competitions and finished the season in fine form, with four Premier League goals after the restart taking his tally for the season to nine.</p>
<p>Analysis: &lsquo;Willian wants one last big deal&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sky Sports News&rsquo; Kaveh Solhekol:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willian wants one big final contract - ideally a three-year deal to take him to 35. Chelsea would like to keep him, though they&rsquo;re not going to offer him three years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the moment, it looks like Arsenal is his most likely destination but he is a free agent and at his age, realistically, you&rsquo;re likely to go where there is the most money and longest contract on offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a great injury record so his agent will be saying, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about his fitness&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arsenal&rsquo;s pursuit of Willian comes as they attempt to seal a new deal for captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who is understood to be close to extending his contract, which is currently set to expire in the summer of 2021.</p>
<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is set to stay at the Emirates</p>
<p>Aubameyang, 31, scored 22 goals in the Premier League last season and netted twice in Arsenal&rsquo;s 2-1 win over Chelsea in Saturday&rsquo;s FA Cup final.</p>
<p>Since his move to Arsenal from Borussia Dortmund in January 2018, he has scored 54 goals in 85 Premier League games.</p>
<p>The news of the Arsenal&rsquo;s offers to Aubameyang and Willian comes after the club made a statement revealing their plan to make 55 members of staff redundant, including international recruitment specialist Francis Cagigao.</p>
<p>Arsenal, who will hold meetings with staff on Friday, said one of the key reasons cutbacks are being made is to &ldquo;maintain investment in the team&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Summer transfer window - key dates and times</p>
<p>The summer transfer window will run for 10 weeks from July 27 and close at 11pm on October 5.</p>
<p>A domestic-only window for trades between the Premier League and EFL then runs from October 5 and closes on Friday October 16 at 5pm. Follow all the news and analysis on Sky Sports News and across Sky Sports&rsquo; digital platforms, including with our dedicated Transfer Centre blog.

<h3 id="atletico-madrid-confirm-two-positive-coronavirus-tests-ahead-of-champions-league-quarter-final">&ldquo;Atletico Madrid confirm two positive coronavirus tests ahead of Champions League quarter-final&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://e2.365dm.com/20/08/1600x900/skysports-atletico-madrid-la-liga_5063341.jpg" alt="img">
Atletico Madrid have confirmed two positive cases of coronavirus from testing carried out on Saturday.</p>
<p>Both individuals who tested positive are self-isolating at home.</p>
<p>Atletico are due to play RB Leipzig in the quarter-finals of the Champions League on Thursday in Lisbon.</p>
<p>Atletico said in a statement: &ldquo;Yesterday, Saturday August 8th, all the members of the first team and of the club&rsquo;s Lisbon travelling party were submitted to tests in the Ciudad Deportiva de Majadahonda as per UEFA&rsquo;s protocol to participate in the Champions League quarter-finals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, two positives appeared among the known results, which are now isolated in their respective homes and were reported immediately to the Spanish and Portuguese health authorities, UEFA, the Royal Spanish Football Federation, the Portuguese Federation and the Superior Council of Sports.</p>
<p>Atletico Madrid beat holders Liverpool to advance to the quarter-finals</p>
<p>&ldquo;As such, a corresponding protocol planned for these circumstances has been activated, which requires new tests to be undertaken to first team players, members of the Lisbon travelling party and those who are in close contact with the positive cases, and which will result in changes in the timings of training sessions, in the structure and development of the journey and the accommodation in the Portuguese capital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The club will coordinate the new timings with UEFA and as soon as a new plan will be made, it will be made public. We ask for maximum respect towards the identity of the two positive cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The format of the final stages of the Champions League were amended following the coronvirus pandemic with the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final all now set to be held in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>
<p>The remaining matches are one-legged ties played in Lisbon at Benfica&rsquo;s Estadio da Luz or Sporting Lisbon&rsquo;s Estadio Jose Alvalade.</p>
