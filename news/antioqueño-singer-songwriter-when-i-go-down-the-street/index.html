<h3 id="meghalaya-constitutes-expert-agency-to-probe-uranium-waste-tank-leakage">&ldquo;Meghalaya constitutes expert agency to probe uranium waste tank leakage&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/10/b800d4b8-764e-4bb5-a558-23f2a6668e40.jpg" alt="img">
The development comes in the wake of reports of a leakage from a concrete tank allegedly containing radioactive uranium waste located in Nongbah Jynrin area.</p>
<p>The Meghalaya government Friday constituted an expert agency to probe an alleged leak from a concrete uranium effluent tank in the South West Khasi Hills district. “We have written to the Central Pollution Control Board as well as the North-Eastern Hill University and other experts — once they respond, and we identify the expert team, we will formally issue an order by next week,” said Deputy Chief Minister Prestone Tynsong.</p>
<p>The development comes in the wake of reports of a leakage from a concrete tank allegedly containing radioactive uranium waste located in uranium-rich Nongbah Jynrin area (135 km from Shillong) of the South West Khasi Hills district on September 21. While the district administration undertook an inquiry into the matter and reported that there was no leakage, local groups and environmentalists have kept up pressure on the government, citing it as a major public health and environment hazard.</p>
<p>Following the incident, Khasi Students’ Union (KSU) members had visited the site along with environmental economist Dr Bremley WB Lyngdoh. According to Forwardman Nongrem, South West Khasi Hills District’s KSU president, the geiger counter — an instrument to detect and measure ionising radiation — detected very high levels of radiation in the area.</p>
<p>The tank in question goes back to the time the Atomic Minerals Directorate (AMD) was carrying out exploratory mining in Meghalaya in the 1970s.</p>
<p>“Mining continued up till 1993 but after a lot of outcry because of the environment and health hazards caused, the mines were directed to be shut,” said Dr Lyngdoh, who is based in London and the co-founder and CEO of EcoFriend World. “AMD left, but without clearing up the tools, effluents etc. They were summoned back and in 1995, they built huge concrete tanks to put in all the remnants, processed uranium decay.”</p>
<p>KSU’s Nongrem said that appointing an expert committee was all well and good, but they wanted the government to prioritise two things. “First, the government should repair any cracks/leaks in the tanks and second, the radiation level should be reduced so that people in the surrounding areas are safe from the emissions,” he said. There are at least seven villages located up to a radius of 3km from the site.</p>
<p>“When we went on October 9 to visit the site, I got the shock of my life — the radiation level recorded by the geiger counter was at 1,083 Count Per Minute,” said Dr Lyngdoh, adding that he had personally apprised CM Conrad Sangma of the situation.</p>
<p>KSU has for long voiced their opposition to exploratory uranium mining operations in the area. After AMD, even the Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) shut its offices in the state when they did not receive requisite permissions/leases for its projects.</p>
<p>Following Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya has the third-highest deposits of uranium in the country, estimated at 9.22 million tonnes.</p>

<h3 id="watches-with-a-james-bond-twist">&ldquo;Watches with a James Bond twist&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn2.theweek.co.uk/sites/theweek/themes/theweek/logo.png" alt="img">
Film fans will have been disappointed to learn that the new James Bond movie, No Time to Die, will now be released in April 2021.</p>
<p>However, the good news is that there are no signs of the excitement abating for the 25th instalment of the franchise, which marks Daniel Craig’s last outing as 007.</p>
<p>Watch fans who love the films also get an extra buzz: Omega’s latest Bond tribute timepiece.</p>
<p>We take a look at this standout limited edition, plus a second option for the more conspicuous Bond admirer. If you want the full 360° spy experience, see our action-packed ski travel suggestion too.</p>
<p>Omega</p>
<p>The delay of the movie hasn’t stopped Omega from pushing forward with its new Bond edition timepieces - which score high on style even if you aren’t a massive 007 fan. It helps if you are though, because these special editions make cool nods to the movie franchise.</p>
<p>The first of the family was the 42mm vintage look Omega Seamaster Diver 300M 007 Edition (above) with “tropical” brown aluminium dial and bezel ring with blackened hands and indexes, nicely finessed with a retro looking mesh titanium bracelet. The case back bears a pleasing “spy” touch too: a series of engraved numbers styled on old military-issue watches, with the code for Navy personnel (0552) and the letter “A” to indicate the watch has a screw-in crown. Look closely and you’ll also see the number “62”, which signifies the year of the first Bond film.</p>
<p>Omega Seamaster Diver 300M 007 Edition with titanium strap; £7,880</p>
<p>Fast forward a little and you have the Omega Seamaster Diver 300M James Bond Numbered Edition (above), an ultra-luxe sleek black watch with a platinum-gold case. Its handsome “Bond” look is enhanced with a classic 007 symbol: the dial has a spiraling gun barrel design in 18K white gold.</p>
<p>Heightening this sense of fandom are some fun design details. Switch the lights low, and this Bond turns on the charm, much like the protagonist himself. You’ll see the glow of a number 50 within the Super-LumiNova of the 10 o’clock index, a reference to the 50th anniversary of the James Bond film On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. Furthermore, the 007 sits at 7 o’clock and the Bond family coat-of-arms at 12 o’clock (there’s a second coat of arms on the case back).</p>
<p>Omega Seamaster Diver 300M James Bond Numbered Edition; £44,480</p>
<p>Breitling</p>
<p>Brietling’s Top Time limited edition is a reworking of a secret agent special. In the 1965 Bond film Thunderball, it graces the wrist of Sean Connery who uses its sneaky gadgetry to locate underwater missiles and avert a nuclear disaster. This iteration sadly doesn’t have a Geiger counter for measuring radiation, which is probably a good thing because imagine how many conspiracy theorists would be queuing outside Breitling to get one.</p>
<p>The watchmaker has, however, sprinkled some magic. It is the first model to be offered with a blockchain-based “passport”: a digital certificate of authenticity which can easily be exchanged between owners. In essence, this is a solid stamp of security to compliment Breitling’s existing digital warranty program. As for its looks, the Top Time is pure retro, emphasised by the stitched brown leather strap and distinctive two-toned face, known affectionately as the “Zorro” dial.</p>
<p>A limited edition of 2000; £4,100.</p>
<p>Where to wear it</p>
<p>Sölden in Austria is a high altitude resort with pristine slopes and excellent spy credentials: the chase sequence in Spectre was filmed on the area’s longest run. If you remember, it’s not a pursuit performed on skis: Villain Hinx, played by the pleasingly menacing Christoph Waltz, and his henchmen kidnap Madeleine and drive down the mountain whilst Bond pursues them in a plane.</p>
<p>You can follow the route yourself by skiing down on Piste no.30 leading from Rettenbach Glacier to the valley floor. Head to the ice Q restaurant for the après-ski. This futuristic cube perched on a cliff is a gourmet haven and features as Hinx’s lair in the film.</p>

<h3 id="poultry-industry-looks-into-use-of-robots">&ldquo;Poultry Industry Looks Into Use of Robots&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/lancasterfarming.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/ea/0ea9156e-13c4-11eb-8b4a-df277da92ade/5f9072d4c37a3.image.jpg?crop=1662%2C1247%2C0%2C0&amp;resize=840%2C630&amp;order=crop%2Cresize" alt="img">
Robotics could play a key role in the future of the poultry industry.</p>
<p>Speakers at the 55th annual National Poultry Health, Processing and Live Production Conference, held virtually Sept. 28-30, discussed implications from helping debone chicken precisely within seconds to patrolling poultry houses for dead birds or eggs.</p>
<p>Robots and drones won’t bread and fry the chicken, at least not yet, but they have the potential to do a remarkable array of tasks quickly and well.</p>
<p>Normally, the conference hosted by Delmarva Poultry Industry Inc. draws a large crowd to Ocean City, Maryland, but the sessions were held virtually this year because of COVID-19 health concerns.</p>
<p>Colin Usher of Georgia Tech Research Institute said robots can reduce, but not eliminate, the need for farmers to spend time in the poultry houses. With less human contact, the possible spread of diseases like avian influenza is also reduced.</p>
<p>Robots can disinfect houses and gently nudge chickens in order to keep the birds moving, he said.</p>
<p>“Ideally, we would like it to be like a Roomba — just set it up in your house and press go,” Usher said.</p>
<p>Videos showed the robots very non-aggressively nudging birds to move out of the way. The robots can be used to disinfect and measure temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>“We even put a Geiger counter on it because we could,” he said.</p>
<p>Much of his presentation concentrated on using the robots to search for and remove dead birds and eggs. He said the robots can find about 90% of eggs and that it takes about 20 seconds to a minute to do so.</p>
<p>Drones could also be used to spot dead birds and then relay that information to robots.</p>
<p>Software can even be installed to monitor the gait of birds. That software is similar to that used by doctors to look at the gait of athletes or patients who have suffered through a stroke, Usher said.</p>
<p>Drone Technology for Poultry</p>
<p>Drones could also perhaps be used to administer aerosol vaccines. Usher said they were looking at having drones administer vaccines while the birds slept.</p>
<p>Usher said Europe is probably ahead of the U.S. in the use of robots in poultry houses because the higher cost of chicken makes farmers more likely to invest in robotics.</p>
<p>Speakers were asked about security and whether the robots could be hacked. They said that a password is generally being used now, but they acknowledged that that is an issue which farmers need to consider.</p>
<p>Dr. Ai-Ping Hu of the Georgia Tech Research Institute spoke about his research to develop robots to more precisely debone chickens on processing lines. Videos of the research showed 3-D imaging of individual birds which allowed robots wielding knives to determine the exact place to precisely cut individual birds within seconds.</p>
<p>Videos showed the robots deboning 15 chickens per minute, which was 75% of their capacity, he said.</p>
<p>That precision can save valuable meat because birds vary in weight, making precision more difficult. It also helps deal with labor shortages.</p>
<p>Both speakers said costs vary, but that efforts are underway to reduce costs and make robotics more affordable. Usher noted that fairly good quality drones are now readily available for only about $500, although short battery life is still an issue.
