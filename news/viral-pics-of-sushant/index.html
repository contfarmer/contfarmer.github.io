Today, June 14 Bollywood woke up to the heartbreaking news of Sushant Singh Rajput committing suicide in his Bandra residence where he was found hanging by his house help who later informed the police. Amid the current situation when the country is crippling with coronavirus pandemic, this news is making people hate the year 2020 even more. While the exact cause of him committing suicide is not known, people cannot stop talking about mental health and depression. #MentalHealthMatters is trending all over Twitter with people discussing how important it is to talk to each other and not let difficult times take away the best of you.</p>
<p>People are remembering quotes and dialogues from his last movie Chhichore, which was ironically about his Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s character encouraging his son to fight suicidal thought and teaching him how to accept failure. Netizens are urging, anyone who is dealing with suicidal thoughts, depressive feelings or anxiety must reach out to their loved ones. People must vent out their feelings to not be pushed towards something as scary as suicide. Take a look at some of the #MentalHealthMatters tweets:</p>
<p>If you are feeling stressed, talk to someone. If you are feeling anxious, talk to someone. If you feel like you have symptoms of depression, please talk to someone. Prioritise yourself. Prioritise your mental health.#MentalHealth #MentalHealthMatters — Harsh Mariwala (@hcmariwala) June 14, 2020</p>

Another one of his dialogues from Chhichore that can be used as life quote is &ldquo;Success Ke Baad Ka Plan Sabke Paas Hai &hellip; Lekin Agar Galti Se Fail Ho Gaye &hellip; Toh Failure Se Kaise Deal Karna Hai &hellip; Iski Koi Baat Hi Nahi Karna Chahta.&rdquo;</p>

Actor Mahesh Babu is spending quality time with his children in this lockdown. His latest mirror selfie with his daughter Sitara Ghattamaneni has gone viral on social media.</p>
<p>Mahesh took to Twitter to share a mirror selfie he clicked with his daughter. He captioned it: “Finding our reflections. Mastering the mirror selfie with Sitara Ghattamaneni.”</p>
<p>Last week, Mahesh Babu is seen playing who is taller with his 13-year-old son Gautham. In the adorable video, Gautam tells his father that he is not that tall. Soon, the actor challenged his son to see who is taller. Gautam couldn’t control his laughter.</p>
<p>On the career front, Mahesh will soon commence work on his next Telugu project with director Vamshi Paidipally. The duo will be reuniting after the grand success of their previous film, Maharshi.</p>
<p>He’s also rumoured to be playing a cameo in Chiranjeevi’s upcoming Telugu film, Acharya. However, the makers are yet to make an official announcement about roping in Mahesh Babu.</p>
<p>The star’s last release Sarileru Neekevvaru was a box-office blockbuster. The film, directed by Anil Ravipudi, raked in over Rs 200 crore at the box-office.</p>
<p>In the film, Mahesh Babu played a soldier who comes to a small town and saves a family from the clutches of a rowdy politician.</p>

<p>The film also featured Prakash Raj, Rashmika Mandanna and veteran actor Vijayashanti, who returned to face the arc lights after 13 years, in crucial roles. Prakash Raj played the antagonist.</p>
<p>There are also reports that Mahesh has a project with director Parasuram in the pipeline. If his upcoming film with Vamshi Paidipally doesn’t take off immediately as planned, he’s said to commence work on Parasuram’s film.</p>
<p>Mahesh Babu also has a project with Arjun Reddy director Sandeep Vanga in the pipeline. This film might only take off next year.</p>

Being born into a family of Royals and filmstars, every action of the star kid was observed closely by fans of her parents Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh even before her debut. The actress was not always the same as she looks like now physically. Sara was always a credential student at the University of Columbia but she always wanted to be on screen as an actor. Her father Saif Ali Khan revealed how she decided to become an actress after watching actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. &ldquo;There was actress Aishwarya Rai on stage in New York with people going ballistic and Sara sitting on the floor behind the curtain saying &lsquo;This is what I want to do&rsquo;,&rdquo; Saif said about Sara on Koffee with Karan where he appeared with his daughter. Sara then started another journey on her own, her weightloss journey. Sara weighed 96 kilos and was headstrong about looking fit on the screen for her debut film. Sara said that she wanted to feel healthy and empowered, emotionally, physically, and mentally. Just like her younger brother, Taimur Ali Khan the actress is also a paparazzi favorite due to her down to earth nature and her beauty, Sara always has a sweet gesture of holding her hands whenever paps click her pictures.
