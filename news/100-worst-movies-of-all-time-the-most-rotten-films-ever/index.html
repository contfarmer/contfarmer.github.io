<p>100 Worst Movies of All Time: The Most Rotten Films Ever</p>
<p>At Rotten Tomatoes, we spend our time promoting and recommending acclaimed movies. But what’s on the other end of that vine? We’re talking movies so awful they’re not only not-Fresh, they’re Rotten, and so Rotten that their Tomatometer scores don’t even crack double digits. Hold tight, folks: We’re going barrel-diving, straight to the bottom and thudding head first for the 100 worst movies of all time!</p>
<p>First of all, you’re going to see lots of 0% movies, and there’s even more out there, but the ones on this list all have at least 20 reviews. We wanted to make sure the movies we’re “vouching” for as the worst ever have inflicted a minimum threshold of agony on critics. And the 20-review entry applies for every other movie on this list, and that includes the usual suspects of garbage cinema, like the deep space train wreck Battlefield Earth, the box office turkey (turtle?) The Master of Disguise, Netflix’s lazy western The Ridiculous 6, and flaccid softcore Killing Me Softly (which also makes a dubious apperance in the 200 best and worst erotic movies ).</p>
<p>You may also note a number of significant stinkers are from the past 20 years. It’s not just because Uwe Boll was employed during this time period. And, by the way, he’s actually beat by dubious directing duo Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg, who have four movies on the list. Instead, it’s the fact more reviews are being written and collected than ever before, so today’s disasters have a better chance of vaunting over 20 reviews. (And for movies that share the same score, more reviews means you’re placed higher within the ranking.)</p>
<p>But fret not: Plenty of yesteryear’s bombs are here. After all, the decade that produced Mac &amp; Me has a lot to account for. Some of the classic trash featured includes the soul-sucking Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, Speed 2: Cruise Control (see what happens when you throw Keanu overboard?), off-the-deep-end Jaws: The Revenge, and prime directive-violating RoboCop 3.</p>
<p>What you won’t see: Some legendary bad movies like Cats, Birdemic, and The Room, all of which have cleared at least a 10% Tomatometer. That’s right, they were too good. And Miami Connection and Plan 9 From Outer Space are actually Fresh!</p>
<p>Now that we set the mood for truly the most Rotten of the crop, start the most painful watchlist you’ll ever make with the 100 worst movies of all time!</p>
<p>#100 Material Girls (2006) 4% #100 Adjusted Score: 5.1% Critics Consensus: Plagued by paper-thin characterizations and a hackneyed script, Material Girls fails to live up to even the minimum standards of its genre. Synopsis: Stripped of their wealth and forced to fend for themselves when the multi-million-dollar cosmetics company inherited from their father suffers&hellip; Stripped of their wealth and forced to fend for themselves when the multi-million-dollar cosmetics company inherited from their father suffers&hellip; [More] Starring: Hilary Duff, Haylie Duff, Anjelica Huston, Lukas Haas Directed By: Martha Coolidge</p>
<p>#99 BloodRayne (2006) 4% #99 Adjusted Score: 5.1% Critics Consensus: BloodRayne is an absurd sword-and-sorcery vid-game adaptation from schlock-maestro Uwe Boll, featuring a distinguished (and slumming) cast. Synopsis: In 18th century Romania, Rayne (a girl with a human mother and vampire father) possesses superhuman strength but a soft&hellip; In 18th century Romania, Rayne (a girl with a human mother and vampire father) possesses superhuman strength but a soft&hellip; [More] Starring: Kristanna Loken, Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez, Ben Kingsley Directed By: Uwe Boll</p>
<p>#97 Darkness (2004) 4% #97 Adjusted Score: 4.803% Critics Consensus: Yet another predictable variation on the hoary old haunted-house movie, Darkness is an illogical, portentous mess. Synopsis: Three weeks ago, just before the lunar eclipse, American teenager Regina and her family moved into a charming old house&hellip; Three weeks ago, just before the lunar eclipse, American teenager Regina and her family moved into a charming old house&hellip; [More] Starring: Iain Glen, Stephan Enquist, Lena Olin, Anna Paquin Directed By: Jaume Balagueró</p>
<p>#93 Flatliners (2017) 4% #93 Adjusted Score: 6.475% Critics Consensus: Flatliners falls flat as a horror movie and fails to improve upon its source material, rendering this reboot dead on arrival. Synopsis: In Flatliners, five medical students, hoping to gain insight into the mystery of what lies beyond the confines of life,&hellip; In Flatliners, five medical students, hoping to gain insight into the mystery of what lies beyond the confines of life,&hellip; [More] Starring: Ellen Page, Diego Luna, Nina Dobrev, James Norton Directed By: Niels Arden Oplev</p>
<p>#80 Arsenal (2017) 3% #80 Adjusted Score: 3.372% Critics Consensus: Aside from an opportunity to watch a mustachioed Nicolas Cage acting from under a wig and behind a prosthetic nose, Arsenal has depressingly little to offer. Synopsis: A powerful action thriller, ARSENAL tells the intertwining stories of the Lindel brothers, Mikey (Johnathon Schaech) and JP (Adrian Grenier),&hellip; A powerful action thriller, ARSENAL tells the intertwining stories of the Lindel brothers, Mikey (Johnathon Schaech) and JP (Adrian Grenier),&hellip; [More] Starring: Adrian Grenier, Johnathon Schaech, John Cusack, Nicolas Cage Directed By: Steven C. Miller</p>
<p>#76 The Darkness (2016) 3% #76 Adjusted Score: 3.364% Critics Consensus: The Darkness clumsily relies on an assortment of genre tropes, leaving only the decidedly non-frightening ghost of superior horror films in its wake. Synopsis: As a family returns home from vacation at the Grand Canyon, they innocently bring home a supernatural force that preys&hellip; As a family returns home from vacation at the Grand Canyon, they innocently bring home a supernatural force that preys&hellip; [More] Starring: Kevin Bacon, Radha Mitchell, David Mazouz, Lucy Fry Directed By: Greg McLean</p>
<p>#75 Passion Play (2011) 3% #75 Adjusted Score: 3.155% Critics Consensus: Passion Play has a terrific cast, but don&rsquo;t be fooled - the only real question at the heart of this misbegotten mystery is what its stars were thinking. Synopsis: A terrific cast will hold you spellbound in PASSION PLAY, a one of a kind seductive thriller from Mitch Glazer,&hellip; A terrific cast will hold you spellbound in PASSION PLAY, a one of a kind seductive thriller from Mitch Glazer,&hellip; [More] Starring: Mickey Rourke, Megan Fox, Bill Murray, Kelly Lynch Directed By: Mitch Glazer</p>
<p>#74 Deal (2008) 3% #74 Adjusted Score: 3.473% Critics Consensus: Employing multiple cinematic clichés and milking stale performances, Deal proves inadequate for even the lowly regarded poker movie genre. Synopsis: Deal yourself in for high-speed thrills and high-stakes poker action in this triumphant tale of cards and courage starring Burt&hellip; Deal yourself in for high-speed thrills and high-stakes poker action in this triumphant tale of cards and courage starring Burt&hellip; [More] Starring: Bret Harrison, Burt Reynolds, Charles Durning, Shannon Elizabeth Directed By: Gil Cates Jr.</p>
<p>#70 The Apparition (2012) 3% #70 Adjusted Score: 4.536% Critics Consensus: The Apparition fails to offer anything original, isn&rsquo;t particularly scary, and offers so little in the way of dramatic momentum that it&rsquo;s more likely to put you to sleep than thrill you. Synopsis: When frightening events start to occur in their home, young couple Kelly (Ashley Greene) and Ben (Sebastian Stan) discover they&hellip; When frightening events start to occur in their home, young couple Kelly (Ashley Greene) and Ben (Sebastian Stan) discover they&hellip; [More] Starring: Ashley Greene, Sebastian Stan, Julianna Guill, Rick Gomez Directed By: Todd Lincoln</p>
<p>#68 Zoom (2006) 3% #68 Adjusted Score: 4.606% Critics Consensus: Lacking the punch and good cheer of The Incredibles and Sky High, Zoom is a dull and laugh-free affair. Synopsis: Former superhero Jack is called back to work to transform an unlikely group of ragtag kids into superheroes at a&hellip; Former superhero Jack is called back to work to transform an unlikely group of ragtag kids into superheroes at a&hellip; [More] Starring: Tim Allen, Courteney Cox, Chevy Chase, Spencer Breslin Directed By: Peter Hewitt</p>
<p>#67 Deuces Wild (2002) 3% #67 Adjusted Score: 4.491% Critics Consensus: Melodramatic and weighed down with silly dialogue, Deuces Wild is a forgettable, overheated thriller that leaves no cliche unturned. Synopsis: This gang warfare drama is from director Scott Kalvert, whose previous film was the controversial and violent The Basketball Diaries&hellip; This gang warfare drama is from director Scott Kalvert, whose previous film was the controversial and violent The Basketball Diaries&hellip; [More] Starring: Stephen Dorff, Brad Renfro, Fairuza Balk, Norman Reedus Directed By: Scott Kalvert</p>
<p>#65 Feardotcom (2002) 3% #65 Adjusted Score: 5.355% Critics Consensus: As frustrating as a 404 error, Fear Dot Com is a stylish, incoherent, and often nasty mess with few scares. Synopsis: Terror is lurking online in this thriller directed by William Malone, who also helmed the 1999 remake of House on&hellip; Terror is lurking online in this thriller directed by William Malone, who also helmed the 1999 remake of House on&hellip; [More] Starring: Stephen Dorff, Natascha McElhone, Stephen Rea, Udo Kier Directed By: William Malone</p>
<p>#62 Rollerball (2002) 3% #62 Adjusted Score: 5.92% Critics Consensus: Removing the social critique of the original, this updated version of Rollerball is violent, confusing, and choppy. Klein makes for a bland hero. Synopsis: Jonathan Cross is an all-American hotshot, the most popular player in the fastest and most extreme sport of all time:&hellip; Jonathan Cross is an all-American hotshot, the most popular player in the fastest and most extreme sport of all time:&hellip; [More] Starring: Chris Klein, Jean Reno, LL Cool J, Rebecca Romijn Directed By: John McTiernan</p>
<p>#60 Getaway (2013) 3% #60 Adjusted Score: 8.05% Critics Consensus: Monotonously fast-paced to the point of exhaustion, Getaway offers a reminder of the dangers in attempting to speed past coherent editing, character development, sensible dialogue, and an interesting plot. Synopsis: Brent Magna (Ethan Hawke) is a burned out race car driver who is thrust into a do-or-die mission behind the&hellip; Brent Magna (Ethan Hawke) is a burned out race car driver who is thrust into a do-or-die mission behind the&hellip; [More] Starring: Ethan Hawke, Selena Gomez, Jon Voight, Rebecca Budig Directed By: Yaron Levy, Courtney Solomon</p>
<p>#59 Nina (2016) 2% #59 Adjusted Score: 2.832% Critics Consensus: A wholly misguided tribute to its subject&rsquo;s searing talent and enduring impact, Nina is the cinematic equivalent of a covers project featuring all the wrong artists. Synopsis: She was one of the century&rsquo;s most extraordinary talents, a 15-time Grammy nominee and Grammy Hall of Fame Recipient her&hellip; She was one of the century&rsquo;s most extraordinary talents, a 15-time Grammy nominee and Grammy Hall of Fame Recipient her&hellip; [More] Starring: Zoe Saldana, David Oyelowo, Mike Epps, Ella Thomas Directed By: Cynthia Mort</p>
<p>#56 Baby Geniuses (1999) 2% #56 Adjusted Score: 3.314% Critics Consensus: Flat direction and actors who look embarrassed to be onscreen make Baby Geniuses worse than the premise suggests. Synopsis: All babies are born knowing the &ldquo;secrets of the universe&rdquo; and with the ability to speak with each other. What&hellip; All babies are born knowing the &ldquo;secrets of the universe&rdquo; and with the ability to speak with each other. What&hellip; [More] Starring: Kathleen Turner, Christopher Lloyd, Kim Cattrall, Peter MacNicol Directed By: Bob Clark</p>
<p>#50 The In Crowd (2000) 2% #50 Adjusted Score: 3.51% Critics Consensus: A dull, soapy potboiler that lacks the energy to qualify as a guilty pleasure, The In Crowd is undone by slow pacing, poor acting, and a stunning lack of originality. Synopsis: Adrien Williams enters the &ldquo;In Crowd&rdquo; when she is hired by a posh East Coast country club and befriended by&hellip; Adrien Williams enters the &ldquo;In Crowd&rdquo; when she is hired by a posh East Coast country club and befriended by&hellip; [More] Starring: Susan Ward, Lori Heuring, Matthew Settle, Nathan Bexton Directed By: Mary Lambert</p>
<p>#46 Disaster Movie (2008) 1% #46 Adjusted Score: 3.114% Critics Consensus: Returning to their seemingly bottomless well of flatulence humor, racial stereotypes, and stale pop culture gags, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have produced what is arguably their worst Movie yet. Synopsis: The filmmaking team behind Date Movie and Meet the Spartans is back with a comedy spoof sending up disaster movies&hellip; The filmmaking team behind Date Movie and Meet the Spartans is back with a comedy spoof sending up disaster movies&hellip; [More] Starring: Matt Lanter, Vanessa Lachey, Carmen Electra, G-Thang Directed By: Aaron Seltzer, Jason Friedberg</p>
<p>#34 Max Steel (2016) 0% #34 Critics Consensus: Bereft of characterization or even satisfying rock &lsquo;em sock &lsquo;em, Max Steel feels like futzing with an action figure without any childhood imagination. Synopsis: 16-year old MAX MCGRATH has just moved to a new town&ndash;and is desperately trying to fit in&ndash;when he discovers his&hellip; 16-year old MAX MCGRATH has just moved to a new town&ndash;and is desperately trying to fit in&ndash;when he discovers his&hellip; [More] Starring: Ben Winchell, Maria Bello, Ana Villafañe, Josh Brener Directed By: Stewart Hendler</p>
<p>#26 The Disappointments Room (2016) 0% #26 Adjusted Score: 0.065% Critics Consensus: The Disappointments Room lives down to its title with a thrill-free thriller that presumably left its stars filled with regret - and threatens to do the same for audiences. Synopsis: In this psychological thriller from the director of Eagle Eye and Disturbia, Dana and David move from Brooklyn to a&hellip; In this psychological thriller from the director of Eagle Eye and Disturbia, Dana and David move from Brooklyn to a&hellip; [More] Starring: Kate Beckinsale, Mel Raido, Gerald McRaney, Lucas Till Directed By: D.J. Caruso</p>
<p>#25 Staying Alive (1983) 0% #25 Adjusted Score: 1.612% Critics Consensus: This sequel to Saturday Night Fever is shockingly embarrassing and unnecessary, trading the original&rsquo;s dramatic depth for a series of uninspired dance sequences. Synopsis: This sequel to Saturday Night Fever is set six years after Tony Manero (John Travolta) blew the competition away during&hellip; This sequel to Saturday Night Fever is set six years after Tony Manero (John Travolta) blew the competition away during&hellip; [More] Starring: John Travolta, Cynthia Rhodes, Finola Hughes, Steve Inwood Directed By: Sylvester Stallone</p>
<p>#17 Problem Child (1990) 0% #17 Adjusted Score: 1.438% Critics Consensus: Mean-spirited and hopelessly short on comic invention, Problem Child is a particularly unpleasant comedy, one that&rsquo;s loaded with manic scenery chewing and juvenile pranks. Synopsis: A yuppie couple adopt an angelic-looking little boy who proves to be an unholy terror in this slapstick comedy. The&hellip; A yuppie couple adopt an angelic-looking little boy who proves to be an unholy terror in this slapstick comedy. The&hellip; [More] Starring: John Ritter, Michael Oliver, Jack Warden, Amy Yasbeck Directed By: Dennis Dugan</p>
<p>#14 Stratton (2018) 0% #14 Adjusted Score: 0.638% Critics Consensus: Stratton&rsquo;s action-thriller ambitions are roundly thwarted by a derivative story, misguided casting, and a low-budget feel underscored by unimpressive set pieces. Synopsis: Stratton, a Special Boat Service operative for MI6, and his American counterpart Marty, scope a laboratory complex in Iran in&hellip; Stratton, a Special Boat Service operative for MI6, and his American counterpart Marty, scope a laboratory complex in Iran in&hellip; [More] Starring: Dominic Cooper, Austin Stowell, Gemma Chan, Connie Nielsen Directed By: Simon West</p>
<p>#13 London Fields (2018) 0% #13 Adjusted Score: 0.638% Critics Consensus: London Fields bungles its beloved source material and an intriguingly eclectic cast, leaving audiences with a would-be neo-noir of interest only to the morbidly curious. Synopsis: Recently arrived in London in the hope of writing one last book before succumbing to a fatal illness, American author&hellip; Recently arrived in London in the hope of writing one last book before succumbing to a fatal illness, American author&hellip; [More] Starring: Amber Heard, Theo James, Jim Sturgess, Billy Bob Thornton Directed By: Mathew Cullen</p>
<p>#12 Dark Crimes (2018) 0% #12 Adjusted Score: 0.638% Critics Consensus: Dark Crimes is a rote, unpleasant thriller that fails to parlay its compelling true story and a committed Jim Carrey performance into even modest chills. Synopsis: Jim Carrey commands the screen in this spellbinding thriller from Executive Producers of The Revenant and Black Mass. When police&hellip; Jim Carrey commands the screen in this spellbinding thriller from Executive Producers of The Revenant and Black Mass.

<p>#10 The Ridiculous 6 (2015) 0% #10 Adjusted Score: 0.51% Critics Consensus: Every bit as lazily offensive as its cast and concept would suggest, The Ridiculous Six is standard couch fare for Adam Sandler fanatics and must-avoid viewing for film enthusiasts of every other persuasion. Synopsis: Six bizarre and diverse strangers in the Wild West discover that they all share the same father, and the newfound&hellip; Six bizarre and diverse strangers in the Wild West discover that they all share the same father, and the newfound&hellip; [More] Starring: Adam Sandler, Terry Crews, Taylor Lautner, Steve Buscemi Directed By: Frank Coraci

<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a21d06fb8a9aecfd719e45ac2b367905cda8a1de/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=ea706d558059a8df4b0734ea14e1e469" alt="img">
Netflix’s once heavily guarded vault of secret statistics has slowly opened up over the last couple of years, a gradual juicy reveal of viewer habits with some major caveats.</p>
<p>Clicked back to life: how Netflix is reviving forgotten film flops Read more</p>
<p>While the streamer still refrains from subscribing to any official, independently measured ratings service, such as Nielsen, tweets and company updates have shared the numbers behind particular success stories and more recently the site added film and TV specific top 10s, updated every day. But the platform still only shares data when it’s positive and the data is based on a viewer now only watching at least two minutes of a title (compared with the previous measurement of 70%).</p>
<p>This week after a quarterly earnings call, the site’s 10 biggest ever original film hits were revealed to Bloomberg, an intriguing dump of information that tells us as much about what isn’t included as it does about what is. Two things to note: the following stats refer to the first four weeks of release and while post-reveal, Netflix has now claimed its new graphic novel adaptation The Old Guard will reach 72m households within its first four weeks, it’s only been out for 10 days so it’s not being included here.</p>
<ol>
<li>Extraction (99 million viewers)</li>
</ol>
<p>While the success of the Chris Hemsworth-led Bangladesh-set action thriller Extraction is an impressive win for all involved (a sequel is on the way), it’s one that needs a certain amount of couching. The film, which sees the Thor star play a black market mercenary, was launched on 24 April this year, a date that has theatrically become known as the start of the summer season (last year Avengers: Endgame was released on the 22nd), a prime slot that this year, with cinemas closed, drove blockbuster-seekers online. Over a month into lockdown, with Netflix viewership inevitably soaring, the arrival of a snazzy new release was transformed into a major event. The combination of a star name and an action-heavy premise would surely have made Extraction a hit regardless but the scale of its numbers reflects an audience craving flashy escapism during a difficult time. It remains a huge turning point for Hemsworth, though, who has struggled outside of the Marvel universe (his many flops include Rush, Men in Black: International, Ghostbusters, Bad Times at the El Royale, Blackhat and In the Heart of the Sea) and together with the success of Chris Evans’ Apple drama Defending Jacob (reportedly their second-biggest show to date), it suggests that our more newly crowned A-listers would be wise to stick to streaming.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Bird Box (89 million viewers)</li>
</ol>
<p>Bird Box, the OG Netflix hit, the platform’s first genuine blockbuster, the film that launched a thousand memes and a head-smashingly stupid viral challenge, should technically be at the top of this list. Back when it was released, in December 2018, a view still required a user to have consumed at least 70% of the title, meaning that however you spin it, more people watched more of Sandra Bullock’s high-concept thriller than they did Extraction. It remains a fascinating case study not just because of the number itself but because of the short-lived pop culture phenomenon that followed and in just a couple of weeks it became the most talked about film of the year, for better or worse. The combination of a snappy premise (easily explained in a quick homepage tease), a smart release date (kids on Christmas holiday, families together needing something to watch) and the long-running star power of Bullock gave the film a propulsion that we’ve still not seen replicated since.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Spenser Confidential (85 million viewers)</li>
</ol>
<p>Released on 6 March this year, just before we were all forced indoors, the Mark Wahlberg caper Spenser Confidential was a perfectly, if unintentionally, timed hit, a film that seemed on first glance to offer the high-octane, high-budget action we were all starting to miss on the big screen. Its ultimate cheapness (like many Netflix originals, it’s really just a flatly made TV movie) and subpar quality didn’t affect its huge numbers, again undeniably bolstered by an extremely captive audience. Its another case of the right star paired with the right genre and Wahlberg has long nurtured a loyal audience with many of his action-heavy big screen outings. That power has waned in recent years but the substantial number of viewers who turned up for him here show that again, his star has by no means dimmed, it’s just more effective outside of the multiplex. Wahlberg has smartly signed on for a sequel as well as engineered himself another Netflix franchise in the shape of Our Man From New Jersey, described as a blue-collar 007.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>6 Underground (83 million viewers)</li>
</ol>
<p>Continuing what’s now a pretty glaringly winning formula of big stars matched with big action released at a time when audiences are extra eager for something to watch, is a win for Michael Bay’s frenetic franchise-starter 6 Underground. Led by Ryan Reynolds, who post-Deadpool has found himself to be not only a bankable leading man again but a reliably efficient one-man marketing machine, the film was mostly loathed by critics but at-home viewership was considerable, turning it into a major hit last December. His Twitter presence was a definite cause of his satirical superhero success and it also helped push this to big numbers in a month that’s now a desirable slot for the platform’s bigger projects.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Murder Mystery (73 million viewers)</li>
</ol>
<p>Last summer, as many of us bemoaned the fall of the movie star, with A-listers flopping on the big screen, Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler showed that their fans hadn’t disappeared, they were just staying home instead. Murder Mystery, a goofy comedy about a couple caught up in a conspiracy while on holiday, quickly became one of the platform’s biggest hits, easily outpacing Sandler’s other Netflix projects. The actor, who has since been met with his best reviews to date for Uncut Gems, signed a considerable deal with Netflix five years ago, arguably the first major big-screen actor to understand the long-term benefits of partnering with a streaming platform. Murder Mystery has been by far his biggest film with the streamer, a sign of the huge fanbase that Aniston carries with her, one that’s only grown since the second life of Friends.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>The Irishman (64 million viewers)</li>
</ol>
<p>While Netflix has successfully spent more time, and a lot more money, expanding its roster of renowned big-name directors making films aimed at creating a splash at the Oscars, viewers have tended not to show quite as much interest as Academy voters. Last October’s big dump of data showed that more people watched shoddy Lifetime-esque thriller Secret Obsession than Roma or any of the streamer’s other big awards bets to that point, none of which made a showing in its annual top 10. Before Martin Scorsese’s extravagant $159m bet The Irishman landed, Netflix conveniently changed how a view was tracked, aware that many might not make it through 70% of a 210-minute film, but it still marked a major milestone for them: a big, starry studio-quality saga that felt like a genuine event last Christmas. It remains the only awards-y title on the list.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Triple Frontier (63 million viewers)</li>
</ol>

<p>Another example here of movie star sway matched with action set pieces yet one supported by a tad more prestige than the other examples higher up on the list. JC Chandor, who found acclaim with Margin Call, All is Lost and A Most Violent Year, ironically decided to make his biggest film to date for Netflix, the sturdy Colombia-set heist thriller Triple Frontier, that used Ben Affleck’s A-list credentials to attract an impressive 63 million viewers last spring. Solidly entertaining and made with more panache than the average Netflix original, the film really did feel like a theatrical pic that viewers missed on the big screen but could watch at home instead. It’s also another reminder of how Affleck’s fanbase interacts with his work, coming just two years after his thriller The Accountant surprised pundits by becoming 2017’s most-rented film, both signs that, like many other stars on this list, the small screen might be the safest place for him in the future.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>The Wrong Missy (59 million viewers)</li>
</ol>

<p>The Wrong Missy, a critically loathed comedy devoid of big star names, has managed to scrape its way inside the bottom of the list thanks to the same major event that lifted three other titles: the coronavirus. Released on 13 May, two months into lockdown at a point when new films were starting to feel scarce, its 59 million viewers are less symbolic of the appeal of stars David Spade and Lauren Lapkus and more a sign of the stranglehold Netflix has had on what we’re watching this year. What many critics seem to agree on, though, is that the film works best as a decent showcase for the talents of Lapkus, a comedian known by most for her role in Orange is the New Black. Netflix has a strong track record of nurturing a stable of talent and it’s likely that we’ll see her in more of their upcoming comedies.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>The Platform (56 million viewers)</li>
</ol>
<p>Another quarantine success here but one that deserves a heartier pat on the back as The Platform is also the only foreign language film on the list, an impressive achievement given the streamer’s growing number of international offerings. So what attracted more people to a grim buzz-free horror than Alfonso Cuarón’s Oscar-winning Roma? The gory Spanish-language film arrived on 20 March without fanfare yet its tale of a dystopian future where people must fight over food to survive proved horribly well-timed. As the recent renewed success of Contagion has proved, many of us have been craving fiction that errs close to the reality we’re now faced with and while The Platform is a more extremist vision than most, it still offered enough claustrophobic paranoia to touch a nerve.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>The Perfect Date (48 million viewers)</li>
</ol>
<p>The streamer’s nifty continuing attempt to resurrect the teen movie, after it mostly disappeared on the big screen, has led to a number of big successes and while on first glance, last April’s The Perfect Date might seem like an odd inclusion here, it’s one that requires some explanation. The previous summer saw Netflix score big with To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, The Kissing Booth and Sierra Burgess is a Loser and while they might have ultimately reached a higher number (To All the Boys allegedly reached 80 million), this was over an extended amount of time. The release of The Perfect Date, starring Noah Centineo who appeared in two of the aforementioned teen hits, the following year came when he was now a Netflix star and when the teen comedy was a popular genre on the platform. The number is then reflective of its first month of release, as the film became part of sleepover movie rotation. It proves yet again that the platform can effectively make and sustain stars (Centineo now has more than 19 million Instagram followers thanks to streaming alone) although their sway outside of Netflix remains questionable.

<h3 id="100-best-movies-under-100-minutes">&ldquo;100 Best movies under 100 minutes&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://STACKER.images.worldnow.com/images/19740274_G.png" alt="img">
Movie magic condenses days and weeks, sometimes years and decades, into an average length of around two hours. The best movies obscure the audience&rsquo;s sense of the actual time going by while they sit in a dark theater or watch at home. Often, those minutes fade as the moviegoer gets caught up in the temporal world on the screen. Great short movies, those under 100 minutes, are especially terrific at making every frame and minute count. According to data reported by Business Insider, between 1950 and 2013 the average movie length hovered just above or below 110 minutes. Notably, critically acclaimed films, Oscar winners, and big budget epics tend to be much longer than the norm. Stacker’s list of the best short films is filled with surprises that seem longer than they are such as Wes Anderson’s sprawling “The Grand Budapest Hotel” and the Coen brothers’ suspenseful thriller “Fargo.”

<p>date: 2020-07-21T10:42:51+08:00</p>
<p>It’s pretty common in movie licensing deals for titles to come on and off networks and platforms, so much so that there’s an industry phrase for it: “windowing.” Usually, these windows last for years, but since many current rights deals (like NBCU’s with WarnerMedia for Harry Potter) were struck before the recent launch of so many new streamers, we are now likely to see shorter windows as various streamers try to find ways to generate publicity and sign-up. While nobody involved is talking, it seems a safe bet that with the Potter pics leaving Max, their next streaming home — at least for a few months — will be NBCU’s Peacock. The company’s deal with WarnerMedia lets it put the movies on NBCU-owned streaming properties, so if the films aren’t going to be on Max, common sense dictates NBCU will want to drive audiences to Peacock with the lure of Harry and the gang. A Peacock rep, however, declined to comment on our speculation.</p>
<p>By the way, just as it was a mistake to assume the Potter movies would be on HBO Max for years to come, it probably wouldn’t be smart to assume the films will now live on Peacock full time until NBCU’s licensing deal expires in 2025. While NBCU might have the right to keep the films locked away from Max, the fact that the company negotiated a spring window for HBO Max suggests there’s a chance that initial agreement could have the Potter movies jumping back and forth between the platforms, or even coexisting together at some point. After all, Peacock is an ad-supported streamer while Max is subscription based. Movies often live on premium linear networks such as HBO and basic cable channels such as USA Network; there’s no reason something similar can’t happen with two kinds of streamers.</p>
<p>May 27, 2020: HBO Max just conjured up an unexpected weapon in its battle to sign up new subscribers: the Harry Potter franchise. In a surprise development, all eight movies in the wizarding series will be a part of HBO Max’s opening day roster, the platform announced Wednesday. The films were not expected to be on HBO Max any time soon, since NBCUniversal had rights to the Potter package tied up until 2025. And while HBO Max execs had made it clear (as recently as this week) that they were interested in figuring out a way to get the movies for the service eventually, there had been no indication any such agreement would be reached in time for today’s launch.</p>
<p>As of the time this story was published, it was not immediately clear what changed — though logic suggests HBO Max parent WarnerMedia was able to hammer out some sort of deal with NBCU giving HBO Max streaming rights to the movies. An HBO Max rep was able to confirm that the service now has exclusive subscription video on demand rights to the Potter movies, all of which were produced by HBO Max sibling studio Warner Bros. Pictures. The movies had not be on a subscription streamer, like Netflix or Hulu, but NBCU-owned networks Syfy and USA have been making them available to stream on their websites. It’s unclear if HBO Max’s streaming “exclusivity” includes the ad-supported showings on the NBCU websites, but barring a complete ripping up of the 2016 pact, it seems likely NBCU will retain linear rights to the movies, allowing them to continue to air on broadcast and cable.

<h3 id="tenet-movie-release-delayed-again-due-to-coronavirus">&ldquo;Tenet movie release delayed again due to coronavirus&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10749/production/_112410476_c5uqkwqknyp0bpokj7u6.jpg" alt="img">
Image copyright Warner Bros Image caption John David Washington stars in Tenet alongside Elizabeth Debicki (seated)</p>
<p>Warner Bros has said it is indefinitely delaying the release of Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s latest movie Tenet due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The fantasy spy epic was originally set to debut on 17 July but this was pushed back to 12 August.</p>
<p>Tenet was expected to be the first big-budget Hollywood film to be released in US cinemas during the summer.</p>
<p>But the studio said it would be re-evaluating its release date &ldquo;amidst all this continued uncertainty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It also suggested that it might consider releasing the film in overseas markets before the US.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not treating Tenet like a traditional global day-and-date release, and our upcoming marketing and distribution plans will reflect that,&rdquo; said Toby Emmerich, chairman of the studio&rsquo;s Pictures Group.</p>
<p>Mr Emmerich said that a release date would be shared &ldquo;imminently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tenet focuses on a protagonist, played by John David Washington, trying to save the world from disaster. Its other stars include Robert Pattinson and Sir Kenneth Branagh.</p>
<p>British director Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s other films include Inception, Interstellar and the Oscar-winning World War II film Dunkirk. He also directed the three films in the so-called Dark Knight trilogy - Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises.</p>
<p>The delay of Tenet&rsquo;s release comes as coronavirus shutdowns continue to devastate the film industry.</p>
<p>In the face of rising infections and deaths, cinemas in New York City and Los Angeles, two of the biggest markets in America, still do not have permission from city authorities to open.</p>
<p>Cinemas in China - one of the world&rsquo;s largest box-office markets - reopened on Monday for the first time in six months, though strict rules are in place which limit their capacity.</p>
<p>In light of the pandemic, several studios have postponed the filming and release of movies, including Disney&rsquo;s live-action remake of Mulan, which is now set for release on 21 August.</p>
<p>But while some distributors have shifted to on-demand releases, Tenet is one of several big-budget films that have been delayed to ensure a full theatrical release.
